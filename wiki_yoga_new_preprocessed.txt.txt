Yoga 
Yoga (; ) is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines which originated in ancient India and aim to control (yoke) and still the mind, recognizing a detached witness-consciousness untouched by the mind ("Chitta") and mundane suffering ("Duḥkha").
There is a wide variety of schools of yoga, practices, and goals in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, and traditional and modern yoga is practiced worldwide.
Two general theories exist on the origins of yoga.
The linear model holds that yoga originated in the Vedic period, as reflected in the Vedic textual corpus, and influenced Buddhism; according to author Edward Fitzpatrick Crangle, this model is mainly supported by Hindu scholars.
According to the synthesis model, yoga is a synthesis of non-Vedic and Vedic elements; this model is favoured in Western scholarship.
Yoga-like practices are first mentioned in the "Rigveda."
Yoga is referred to in a number of the Upanishads.
The first known appearance of the word "yoga" with the same meaning as the modern term is in the "Katha Upanishad", which was probably composed between the fifth and third centuries BCE.
Yoga continued to develop as a systematic study and practice during the fifth and sixth centuries BCE in ancient India's ascetic and Śramaṇa movements.
The most comprehensive text on Yoga, the "Yoga Sutras of Patanjali", date to the early centuries of the Common Era; Yoga philosophy became known as one of the six orthodox philosophical schools ("Darśanas") of Hinduism in the second half of the first millennium CE.
Hatha yoga texts began to emerge between the ninth and 11th centuries, originating in tantra.
The term "yoga" in the Western world often denotes a modern form of Hatha yoga and a posture-based physical fitness, stress-relief and relaxation technique, consisting largely of asanas; this differs from traditional yoga, which focuses on meditation and release from worldly attachments.
It was introduced by gurus from India after the success of Swami Vivekananda's adaptation of yoga without asanas in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
Vivekananda introduced the "Yoga Sutras" to the West, and they became prominent after the 20th-century success of hatha yoga.
Etymology.
The Sanskrit noun योग "" is derived from the root " (युज्) " "to attach, join, harness, yoke".
"Yoga" is a cognate of the English word "yoke".
According to Mikel Burley, the first use of the root of the word "yoga" is in hymn 5.81.1 of the "Rigveda", a dedication to the rising Sun-god, where it has been interpreted as "yoke" or "control".
Pāṇini (4th c. BCE) wrote that the term "yoga" can be derived from either of two roots: "yujir yoga" (to yoke) or "yuj samādhau" ("to concentrate").
In the context of the "Yoga Sutras", the root "yuj samādhau" (to concentrate) is considered the correct etymology by traditional commentators.
In accordance with Pāṇini, Vyasa (who wrote the first commentary on the "Yoga Sutras") says that yoga means "samadhi" (concentration).
In the "Yoga Sutras" (2.1), "kriyāyoga" is yoga's "practical" aspect: the "union with the supreme" in the performance of everyday duties.
A person who practices yoga, or follows the yoga philosophy with a high level of commitment, is called a yogi; a female yogi may also be known as a yogini.
Definitions in classical texts.
The term "yoga" has been defined in different ways in Indian philosophical and religious traditions.
Goals.
The ultimate goals of yoga are stilling the mind and gaining insight, resting in detached awareness, and liberation ("Moksha") from "saṃsāra" and "duḥkha": a process (or discipline) leading to unity ("Aikyam") with the divine ("Brahman") or with one's Self ("Ātman").
This goal varies by philosophical or theological system.
In the classical Astanga yoga system, the ultimate goal of yoga is to achieve "samadhi" and remain in that state as pure awareness.
According to Knut A. Jacobsen, yoga has five principal meanings: 
David Gordon White writes that yoga's core principles were more or less in place in the 5th century CE, and variations of the principles developed over time: 
According to White, the last principle relates to legendary goals of yoga practice; it differs from yoga's practical goals in South Asian thought and practice since the beginning of the Common Era in Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain philosophical schools.
History.
There is no consensus on yoga's chronology or origins other than its development in ancient India.
There are two broad theories explaining the origins of yoga.
The linear model holds that yoga has Vedic origins (as reflected in Vedic texts), and influenced Buddhism.
This model is mainly supported by Hindu scholars.
According to the synthesis model, yoga is a synthesis of indigenous, non-Vedic practices with Vedic elements.
This model is favoured in Western scholarship.
Speculations about yoga began to emerge in the early Upanishads of the first half of the first millennium BCE, with expositions also appearing in Jain and Buddhist texts .
Between 200 BCE and 500 CE, traditions of Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain philosophy were taking shape; teachings were collected as sutras, and a philosophical system of "Patanjaliyogasastra" began to emerge.
The Middle Ages saw the development of a number of yoga satellite traditions.
It and other aspects of Indian philosophy came to the attention of the educated Western public during the mid-19th century.
Origins.
Linear model.
According to Edward Fitzpatrick Crangle, Hindu researchers have favoured a linear theory which attempts "to interpret the origin and early development of Indian contemplative practices as a sequential growth from an Aryan genesis"; traditional Hinduism regards the Vedas as the source of all spiritual knowledge.
Edwin Bryant wrote that authors who support Indigenous Aryanism also tend to support the linear model.
Synthesis model.
Heinrich Zimmer was an exponent of the synthesis model, arguing for non-Vedic eastern states of India.
According to Zimmer, Yoga is part of a non-Vedic system which includes the Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy, Jainism and Buddhism: "[Jainism] does not derive from Brahman-Aryan sources, but reflects the cosmology and anthropology of a much older pre-Aryan upper class of northeastern India [Bihar] – being rooted in the same subsoil of archaic metaphysical speculation as Yoga, Sankhya, and Buddhism, the other non-Vedic Indian systems."
Richard Gombrich and Geoffrey Samuel believe that the "śramaṇa" movement originated in non-Vedic Greater Magadha.
Thomas McEvilley favors a composite model in which a pre-Aryan yoga prototype existed in the pre-Vedic period and was refined during the Vedic period.
According to Gavin D. Flood, the Upanishads differ fundamentally from the Vedic ritual tradition and indicate non-Vedic influences.
However, the traditions may be connected: 
The ascetic traditions of the eastern Ganges plain are thought to drew from a common body of practices and philosophies, with proto-samkhya concepts of "purusha" and "prakriti" as a common denominator.
Indus Valley Civilisation.
The twentieth-century scholars Karel Werner, Thomas McEvilley, and Mircea Eliade believe that the central figure of the Pashupati seal is in a Mulabandhasana posture, and the roots of yoga are in the Indus Valley civilisation.
This is rejected by more recent scholarship; for example, Geoffrey Samuel, Andrea R. Jain, and Wendy Doniger describe the identification as speculative; the meaning of the figure will remain unknown until Harappan script is deciphered, and the roots of yoga cannot be linked to the IVC.
Earliest references (1000–500 BCE).
The Vedas, the only texts preserved from the early Vedic period and codified between c. 1200 and 900 BCE, contain references to yogic practices primarily related to ascetics outside, or on the fringes of Brahmanism.
The "Rigveda" Nasadiya Sukta suggests an early Brahmanic contemplative tradition.
Techniques for controlling breath and vital energies are mentioned in the "Atharvaveda" and in the Brahmanas (the second layer of the Vedas, composed c. 1000–800 BCE).
According to Flood, "The Samhitas [the mantras of the Vedas] contain some references ... to ascetics, namely the Munis or Keśins and the Vratyas."
Werner wrote in 1977 that the "Rigveda" does not describe yoga, and there is little evidence of practices.
The earliest description of "an outsider who does not belong to the Brahminic establishment" is found in the Keśin hymn 10.136, the "Rigveda" youngest book, which was codified around 1000 BCE.
Werner wrote that there were 
According to Whicher (1998), scholarship frequently fails to see the connection between the contemplative practices of the "rishis" and later yoga practices: "The proto-Yoga of the Vedic rishis is an early form of sacrificial mysticism and contains many elements characteristic of later Yoga that include: concentration, meditative observation, ascetic forms of practice ("tapas"), breath control practiced in conjunction with the recitation of sacred hymns during the ritual, the notion of self-sacrifice, impeccably accurate recitation of sacred words (prefiguring "mantra-yoga"), mystical experience, and the engagement with a reality far greater than our psychological identity or the ego."
Jacobsen wrote in 2018, "Bodily postures are closely related to the tradition of ("tapas"), ascetic practices in the Vedic tradition"; ascetic practices used by Vedic priests "in their preparations for the performance of the sacrifice" may be precursors of yoga.
"The ecstatic practice of enigmatic longhaired "muni" in "Rgveda" 10.136 and the ascetic performance of the "vratya-s" in the "Atharvaveda" outside of or on the fringe of the Brahmanical ritual order, have probably contributed more to the ascetic practices of yoga."
According to Bryant, practices recognizable as classical yoga first appear in the Upanishads (composed during the late Vedic period).
Alexander Wynne agrees that formless, elemental meditation might have originated in the Upanishadic tradition.
An early reference to meditation is made in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (c. 900 BCE), one of the Principal Upanishads.
The Chandogya Upanishad (c. 800–700 BCE) describes the five vital energies ("prana"), and concepts of later yoga traditions (such as blood vessels and an internal sound) are also described in this upanishad.
The practice of pranayama (focusing on the breath) is mentioned in hymn 1.5.23 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, and pratyahara (withdrawal of the senses) is mentioned in hymn 8.15 of Chandogya Upanishad.
The Jaiminiya Upanishad Brahmana (probably before the 6th c. BCE) teaches breath control and repetition of a mantra.
The 6th-c. BCE Taittiriya Upanishad defines yoga as the mastery of body and senses.
According to Flood, "[T]he actual term "yoga" first appears in the Katha Upanishad, dated to the fifth to first centuries BCE.
Second urbanisation (500–200 BCE).
Systematic yoga concepts begin to emerge in texts dating to c. 500–200 BCE, such as the early Buddhist texts, the middle Upanishads, and the "Mahabharata" "Bhagavad Gita" and "Shanti Parva".
Buddhism and the śramaṇa movement.
According to Geoffrey Samuel, the "best evidence to date" suggests that yogic practices "developed in the same ascetic circles as the early śramaṇa movements (Buddhists, Jainas and Ajivikas), probably in around the sixth and fifth centuries BCE."
This occurred during India's second urbanisation period.
According to Mallinson and Singleton, these traditions were the first to use mind-body techniques (known as "Dhyāna" and "tapas") but later described as yoga, to strive for liberation from the round of rebirth.
Werner writes, "The Buddha was the founder of his [Yoga] system, even though, admittedly, he made use of some of the experiences he had previously gained under various Yoga teachers of his time."
He notes: 
Early Buddhist texts describe yogic and meditative practices, some of which the Buddha borrowed from the śramaṇa tradition.
The Pāli Canon contains three passages in which the Buddha describes pressing the tongue against the palate to control hunger or the mind, depending on the passage.
There is no mention of the tongue inserted into the nasopharynx, as in khecarī mudrā.
The Buddha used a posture in which pressure is put on the perineum with the heel, similar to modern postures used to evoke Kundalini.
Suttas which discuss yogic practice include the "Satipatthana Sutta" (the four foundations of mindfulness sutta) and the "Anapanasati Sutta" (the mindfulness of breathing sutta).
The chronology of these yoga-related early Buddhist texts, like the ancient Hindu texts, is unclear.
Early Buddhist sources such as the Majjhima Nikāya mention meditation; the Aṅguttara Nikāya describes "jhāyins" (meditators) who resemble early Hindu descriptions of "muni", the Kesin and meditating ascetics, but the meditation practices are not called "yoga" in these texts.
The earliest known discussions of yoga in Buddhist literature, as understood in a modern context, are from the later Buddhist Yogācāra and Theravada schools.
Jain meditation is a yoga system which predated the Buddhist school.
Since Jain sources are later than Buddhist ones, however, it is difficult to distinguish between the early Jain school and elements derived from other schools.
Most of the other contemporary yoga systems alluded to in the Upanishads and some Buddhist texts have been lost.
Upanishads.
The Upanishads, composed in the late Vedic period, contain the first references to practices recognizable as classical yoga.
The first known appearance of the word "yoga" in the modern sense is in the Katha Upanishad (probably composed between the fifth and third centuries BCE), where it is defined as steady control of the senses whichwith cessation of mental activityleads to a supreme state.
The Katha Upanishad integrates the monism of the early Upanishads with concepts of samkhya and yoga.
It defines levels of existence by their proximity to one's innermost being.
Yoga is viewed as a process of interiorization, or ascent of consciousness.
The upanishad is the earliest literary work which highlights the fundamentals of yoga.
According to White, 
The hymns in book two of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad (another late-first-millennium BCE text) describe a procedure in which the body is upright, the breath is restrained and the mind is meditatively focused, preferably in a cave or a place that is simple and quiet.
The "Maitrayaniya Upanishad", probably composed later than the Katha and Shvetashvatara Upanishads but before the "Yoga Sutras of Patanjali", mentions a sixfold yoga method: breath control, introspective withdrawal of the senses, meditation ("dhyana"), mental concentration, logic and reasoning, and spiritual union.
In addition to discussions in the Principal Upanishads, the twenty Yoga Upanishads and related texts (such as "Yoga Vasistha", composed between the sixth and 14th centuries CE) discuss yoga methods.
Macedonian texts.
Alexander the Great reached India in the 4th century BCE.
In addition to his army, he brought Greek academics who wrote memoirs about its geography, people, and customs.
One of Alexander's companions was Onesicritus (quoted in Book 15, Sections 63–65 by Strabo in his "Geography"), who describes yogis.
Onesicritus says that the yogis were aloof and adopted "different postures – standing or sitting or lying naked – and motionless".
Onesicritus also mentions attempts by his colleague, Calanus, to meet them.
Initially denied an audience, he was later invited because he was sent by a "king curious of wisdom and philosophy".
Onesicritus and Calanus learn that the yogis consider life's best doctrines to "rid the spirit of not only pain, but also pleasure", that "man trains the body for toil in order that his opinions may be strengthened", that "there is no shame in life on frugal fare", and that "the best place to inhabit is one with scantiest equipment or outfit".
According to Charles Rockwell Lanman, these principles are significant in the history of yoga's spiritual side and may reflect the roots of "undisturbed calmness" and "mindfulness through balance" in the later works of Patanjali and Buddhaghosa.
"Mahabharata" and "Bhagavad Gita".
"Nirodhayoga" (yoga of cessation), an early form of yoga, is described in the Mokshadharma section of the 12th chapter ("Shanti Parva") of the third-century BCE "Mahabharata".
"Nirodhayoga" emphasizes progressive withdrawal from empirical consciousness, including thoughts and sensations, until "purusha" (self) is realized.
Terms such as "vichara" (subtle reflection) and "viveka" (discrimination) similar to Patanjali's terminology are used, but not described.
Although the "Mahabharata" contains no uniform yogic goal, the separation of self from matter and perception of Brahman everywhere are described as goals of yoga.
Samkhya and yoga are conflated, and some verses describe them as identical.
Mokshadharma also describes an early practice of elemental meditation.
The "Mahabharata" defines the purpose of yoga as uniting the individual "ātman" with the universal Brahman pervading all things.
The "Bhagavad Gita" ("Song of the Lord"), part of the "Mahabharata", contains extensive teachings about yoga.
According to Mallinson and Singleton, the "Gita" "seeks to appropriate yoga from the renunciate milieu in which it originated, teaching that it is compatible with worldly activity carried out according to one's caste and life stage; it is only the fruits of one's actions that are to be renounced."
In addition to a chapter (chapter six) dedicated to traditional yoga practice (including meditation), it introduces three significant types of yoga: 
The "Gita" consists of 18 chapters and 700 "shlokas" (verses); each chapter is named for a different form of yoga.
Some scholars divide the "Gita" into three sections; the first six chapters (280 "shlokas") deal with karma yoga, the middle six (209 "shlokas") with bhakti yoga, and the last six (211 "shlokas" with jnana yoga.
However, elements of all three are found throughout the work.
Philosophical sutras.
Yoga is discussed in the foundational sutras of Hindu philosophy.
The "Vaiśeṣika Sūtra" of the Vaisheshika school of Hinduism, composed between the sixth and second centuries BCE, discusses yoga.
According to Johannes Bronkhorst, the "Vaiśeṣika Sūtra" describes yoga as "a state where the mind resides only in the Self and therefore not in the senses".
This is equivalent to "pratyahara" (withdrawal of the senses).
The sutra asserts that yoga leads to an absence of "sukha" (happiness) and "dukkha" (suffering), describing meditative steps in the journey towards spiritual liberation.
The "Brahma Sutras", the foundation text of the Vedanta school of Hinduism, also discusses yoga.
Estimated as completed in its surviving form between 450 BCE and 200 CE, its sutras assert that yoga is a means to attain "subtlety of body".
The "Nyaya Sutras"—the foundation text of the Nyaya school, estimated as composed between the sixth century BCE and the secondcentury CE—discusses yoga in sutras 4.2.38–50.
It includes a discussion of yogic ethics, dhyana (meditation) and samadhi, noting that debate and philosophy are also forms of yoga.
Classical era (200 BCE – 500 CE).
The Indic traditions of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism were taking shape during the period between the Mauryan and the Gupta eras (c. 200 BCE – 500 CE), and systems of yoga began to emerge; a number of texts from these traditions discussed and compiled yoga methods and practices.
Key works of the era include the "Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali," the "Yoga-Yājñavalkya," the "Yogācārabhūmi-Śāstra", and the "Visuddhimagga."
"Yoga Sutras of Patanjali".
One of the best-known early expressions of Brahminical yoga thought is the "Yoga Sutras of Patanjali" (early centuries CE, the original name of which may have been the "Pātañjalayogaśāstra-sāṃkhya-pravacana" (c. 325–425 CE); some scholars believe that it included the sutras and a commentary.
As the name suggests, the metaphysical basis of the text is samkhya; the school is mentioned in Kauṭilya's Arthashastra as one of the three categories of "anviksikis" (philosophies), with yoga and "Cārvāka".
Yoga and samkhya have some differences; yoga accepted the concept of a personal god, and Samkhya was a rational, non-theistic system of Hindu philosophy.
Patanjali's system is sometimes called "Seshvara Samkhya", distinguishing it from Kapila's Nirivara Samkhya.
The parallels between yoga and samkhya were so close that Max Müller says, "The two philosophies were in popular parlance distinguished from each other as Samkhya with and Samkhya without a Lord."
Karel Werner wrote that the systematization of yoga which began in the middle and early Yoga Upanishads culminated in the "Yoga Sutras of Patanjali".
The "Yoga Sutras" are also influenced by the Sramana traditions of Buddhism and Jainism, and may be a further Brahmanical attempt to adopt yoga from those traditions.
Larson noted a number of parallels in ancient samkhya, yoga and Abhidharma Buddhism, particularly from the second century BCE to the first century AD.
Patanjali's "Yoga Sutras" are a synthesis of the three traditions.
From Samkhya, they adopt the "reflective discernment" ("adhyavasaya") of "prakrti" and "purusa" (dualism), their metaphysical rationalism, and their three epistemological methods of obtaining knowledge.
Larson says that the "Yoga Sutras" pursue an altered state of awareness from Abhidharma Buddhism's "nirodhasamadhi"; unlike Buddhism's "no self or soul", however, yoga (like Samkhya) believes that each individual has a self.
The third concept which the "Yoga Sutras" synthesize is the ascetic tradition of meditation and introspection.
Patanjali's "Yoga Sutras" are considered the first compilation of yoga philosophy.
The verses of the "Yoga Sutras" are terse.
Many later Indian scholars studied them and published their commentaries, such as the "Vyasa Bhashya" (c. 350–450 CE).
Patanjali defines the word "yoga" in his second sutra, and his terse definition hinges on the meaning of three Sanskrit terms.
I.
K. Taimni translates it as "Yoga is the inhibition (') of the modifications (') of the mind ("")".
Swami Vivekananda translates the sutra as "Yoga is restraining the mind-stuff ("Citta") from taking various forms ("Vrittis")."
Edwin Bryant writes that to Patanjali, "Yoga essentially consists of meditative practices culminating in attaining a state of consciousness free from all modes of active or discursive thought, and of eventually attaining a state where consciousness is unaware of any object external to itself, that is, is only aware of its own nature as consciousness unmixed with any other object."
Baba Hari Dass writes that if yoga is understood as nirodha (mental control), its goal is "the unqualified state of "niruddha" (the perfection of that process)".
"Yoga (union) implies duality (as in joining of two things or principles); the result of yoga is the nondual state ... as the union of the lower self and higher Self.
The nondual state is characterized by the absence of individuality; it can be described as eternal peace, pure love, Self-realization, or liberation."
Patanjali defined an eight-limbed yoga in "Yoga Sutras" 2.29: 
In Hindu scholasticism since the 12th century, yoga has been one of the six orthodox philosophical schools (darsanas): traditions which accept the Vedas.
Yoga and Vedanta.
Yoga and "Vedanta" are the two largest surviving schools of Hindu traditions.
Although they share many principles, concepts, and the belief in Self, they differ in degree, style, and methods; yoga accepts three means to obtain knowledge, and Advaita Vedanta accepts.
Yoga disputes Advaita Vedanta's monism.
It believes that in the state of moksha, each individual discovers the blissful, liberating sense of himself or herself as an independent identity; Advaita Vedanta teaches that in the state of moksha, each individual discovers the blissful, liberating sense of himself or herself as part of oneness with everything, everyone and the Universal Self.
They both hold that the free conscience is transcendent, liberated and self-aware.
Advaita Vedanta also encourages the use of Patanjali's yoga practices and the "Upanishads" for those seeking the supreme good and ultimate freedom.
Yoga Yajnavalkya.
The "Yoga Yajnavalkya" is a classical treatise on yoga, attributed to the Vedic sage Yajnavalkya, in the form of a dialogue between Yajnavalkya and the renowned philosopher Gargi Vachaknavi.
The origin of the 12-chapter text has been traced to the second century BCE and the fourth century CE.
A number of yoga texts, such as the "Hatha Yoga Pradipika", the "Yoga Kundalini" and the "Yoga Tattva Upanishads", have borrowed from (or frequently refer to) the "Yoga Yajnavalkya".
It discusses eight yoga asanas (Swastika, Gomukha, Padma, Vira, Simha, Bhadra, Mukta and Mayura), a number of breathing exercises for body cleansing, and meditation.
Abhidharma and Yogachara.
The Buddhist tradition of Abhidharma spawned treatises which expanded teachings on Buddhist theory and yoga techniques which influenced Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism.
At the height of the Gupta period (fourth to fifth centuries CE), a northern Mahayana movement known as Yogācāra began to be systematized with the writings of Buddhist scholars Asanga and Vasubandhu.
Yogācāra Buddhism provided a systematic framework for practices which lead a bodhisattva towards awakening and full Buddhahood.
Its teachings are found in the encyclopedic "Yogācārabhūmi-Śāstra" ("Treatise for Yoga Practitioners"), which was also translated into Tibetan and Chinese and influenced East Asian and Tibetan Buddhist traditions.
Mallinson and Singleton write that the study of Yogācāra Buddhism is essential to understand yoga's early history, and its teachings influenced the "Pātañjalayogaśāstra."
The South India and Sri Lankan-based Theravada school also developed manuals for yogic and meditative training, primarily the "Vimuttimagga" and the "Visuddhimagga".
Jainism.
According to "Tattvarthasutra", a second-to-fifth century Jain text, yoga is the sum of all activities of mind, speech and body.
Umasvati calls yoga the generator of karma, and essential to the path to liberation.
In his "Niyamasara", Kundakunda describes "yoga bhakti"—devotion to the path to liberation—as the highest form of devotion.
Haribhadra and Hemacandra note the five major vows of ascetics and 12 minor vows of laity in yoga.
According to Robert J. Zydenbos, Jainism is a system of yogic thinking which became a religion.
The five yamas (constraints) of the "Yoga Sutras of Patanjali" are similar to Jainism's five major vows, indicating cross-fertilization between these traditions.
Hinduism's influence on Jain yoga may be seen in Haribhadra's "Yogadṛṣṭisamuccaya", which outlines an eightfold yoga influenced by Patanjali's eightfold yoga.
Middle Ages (500–1500 CE).
The Middle Ages saw the development of satellite yoga traditions.
Hatha yoga emerged during this period.
Bhakti movement.
In medieval Hinduism, the Bhakti movement advocated the concept of a personal god or Supreme Personality.
The movement, begun by the Alvars of South India during the 6th to 9th centuries, became influential throughout India by the 12th to 15th centuries.
Shaiva and Vaishnava "bhakti" traditions integrated aspects of the "Yoga Sutras" (such as meditative exercises) with devotion.
The "Bhagavata Purana" elucidates a form of yoga known as "viraha" (separation) "bhakti", which emphasizes concentration on Krishna.
Tantra.
"Tantra" is a range of esoteric traditions which had begun to arise in India by the 5th century CE.
Its use suggests that the word "tantra" in the "Rigveda" means "technique".
George Samuel wrote that "tantra" is a contested term, but may be considered a school whose practices appeared in nearly-complete form in Buddhist and Hindu texts by about the 10th century CE.
Tantric yoga developed complex visualizations, which included meditation on the body as a microcosm of the cosmos.
It included mantras, breath control, and body manipulation (including its nadis and chakras.
Teachings about chakras and Kundalini became central to later forms of Indian yoga.
Tantric concepts influenced Hindu, Bon, Buddhist, and Jain traditions.
Elements of Tantric rituals were adopted by, and influenced, state functions in medieval Buddhist and Hindu kingdoms in East and Southeast Asia.
By the turn of the first millennium, hatha yoga emerged from tantra.
Vajrayana and Tibetan Buddhism.
Vajrayana is also known as Tantric Buddhism and "Tantrayāna".
Its texts began to be compiled during the seventh century CE, and Tibetan translations were completed the following century.
These "tantra" texts were the main source of Buddhist knowledge imported into Tibet, and were later translated into Chinese and other Asian languages.
The Buddhist text Hevajra Tantra and "caryāgiti" introduced hierarchies of chakras.
Yoga is a significant practice in Tantric Buddhism.
Tantra yoga practices include postures and breathing exercises.
The Nyingma school practices yantra yoga, a discipline which includes breath work, meditation and other exercises.
Nyingma meditation is divided into stages, such as Kriya Yoga, Upa yoga, Yoga yana, mahā yoga, Anu yoga and atiyoga.
The Sarma traditions also include Kriya, Upa (called "Charya"), and yoga, with anuttara yoga replacing mahayoga and atiyoga.
Zen Buddhism.
Zen, whose name derives from the Sanskrit "dhyāna" via the Chinese "ch'an", is a form of Mahayana Buddhism in which yoga is an integral part.
Medieval hatha yoga.
The first references to hatha yoga are in eighth-century Buddhist works.
The earliest definition of hatha yoga is in the 11th-century Buddhist text "Vimalaprabha".
Hatha yoga blends elements of Patanjali's "Yoga Sutras" with posture and breathing exercises.
It marks the development of asanas into the full-body postures in current popular use and, with its modern variations, is the style presently associated with the word "yoga".
Sikhism.
Yogic groups became prominent in Punjab during the 15th and 16th centuries, when Sikhism was beginning.
Compositions by Guru Nanak (the founder of Sikhism) describe dialogues he had with Jogis, a Hindu community which practiced yoga.
Guru Nanak rejected the austerities, rites and rituals associated with hatha yoga, advocating sahaja yoga or nama yoga instead.
According to the Guru Granth Sahib, 
Modern revival.
Introduction in the West.
Yoga and other aspects of Indian philosophy came to the attention of the educated Western public during the mid-19th century, and N. C. Paul published his "Treatise on Yoga Philosophy" in 1851.
Swami Vivekananda, the first Hindu teacher to advocate and disseminate elements of yoga to a Western audience, toured Europe and the United States in the 1890s.
His reception built on the interest of intellectuals who included the New England Transcendentalists; among them were Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–1882), who drew on German Romanticism and philosophers and scholars such as Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831), the brothers August Wilhelm Schlegel (1767–1845) and Friedrich Schlegel (1772–1829), Max Mueller (1823–1900), and Arthur Schopenhauer (1788–1860).
Theosophists, including Helena Blavatsky, also influenced the Western public's view of yoga.
Esoteric views at the end of the 19th century encouraged the reception of Vedanta and yoga, with their correspondence between the spiritual and the physical.
The reception of yoga and Vedanta entwined with the (primarily neoplatonic) currents of religious and philosophical reform and transformation during the 19th and early 20th centuries.
Mircea Eliade brought a new element to yoga, emphasizing tantric yoga in his "Yoga: Immortality and Freedom".
With the introduction of tantra traditions and philosophy, the conception of the "transcendent" attained by yogic practice shifted from the mind to the body.
Yoga as exercise.
The postural yoga of the Western world is a physical activity consisting of asanas (often connected by smooth transitions, sometimes accompanied by breathing exercises and usually ending with a period of relaxation or meditation.
It is often known simply as "yoga", despite older Hindu traditions (some dating to the "Yoga Sutras") in which asanas played little or no part; asanas were not central to any tradition.
Yoga as exercise is part of a modern yoga renaissance, a 20th-century blend of Western gymnastics and haṭha yoga pioneered by Shri Yogendra and Swami Kuvalayananda.
Before 1900, hatha yoga had few standing poses; the Sun Salutation was pioneered by Bhawanrao Shrinivasrao Pant Pratinidhi, the Rajah of Aundh, during the 1920s.
Many standing poses used in gymnastics were incorporated into yoga by Krishnamacharya in Mysore between the 1930s and the 1950s.
Several of his students founded schools of yoga.
Pattabhi Jois created ashtanga vinyasa yoga, which led to Power Yoga; B. K. S. Iyengar created Iyengar Yoga and systematised asanas in his 1966 book, "Light on Yoga"; Indra Devi taught yoga to Hollywood actors; and Krishnamacharya's son, T. K. V. Desikachar, founded the Krishnamacharya Yoga Mandalam in Chennai.
Other schools founded during the 20th century include Bikram Choudhury's Bikram Yoga and Swami Sivananda of Rishikesh's Sivananda yoga.
Modern yoga has spread around the world.
The number of asanas used in yoga has increased from 84 in 1830 (as illustrated in "Joga Pradipika") to about 200 in "Light on Yoga" and over 900 performed by Dharma Mittra by 1984.
The goal of haṭha yoga (spiritual liberation through energy) was largely replaced by the goals of fitness and relaxation, and many of its more esoteric components were reduced or removed.
The term "hatha yoga" also refers to gentle yoga, often for women.
Yoga has developed into a worldwide, multi-billion-dollar business involving classes, teacher certification, clothing, books, videos, equipment, and holidays.
The ancient, cross-legged lotus position and Siddhasana are widely-recognised symbols of yoga.
The United Nations General Assembly established 21 June as the International Day of Yoga, and it has been celebrated annually around the world since 2015.
On 1 December 2016, yoga was listed by UNESCO as an intangible cultural heritage.
The effect of postural yoga on physical and mental health has been a subject of study, with evidence that regular yoga practice is beneficial for low back pain and stress.
In 2017, a Cochrane review found that yoga interventions designed for chronic low back pain increased function at the six month mark, and modestly decreased pain after 3–4 months.
The decrease in pain was found to be similar to other exercise programs designed for low-back pain, but the decrease is not large enough to be deemed clinically significant.
Theories of the mechanism underlying these changes include the increase in strength and flexibility, physical and mental relaxation and increased body awareness.
Traditions.
Yoga is practised with a variety of methods by all Indian religions.
In Hinduism, practices include jnana yoga, bhakti yoga, karma yoga, kundalini yoga, and hatha yoga.
Jain yoga.
Yoga has been a central practice in Jainism.
Jain spirituality is based on a strict code of nonviolence, or ahimsa (which includes vegetarianism), almsgiving (dāna), faith in the three jewels, austerities ("tapas") such as fasting, and yoga.
Jain yoga aims at the liberation and purification of the self from the forces of karma, which binds the self to the cycle of reincarnation.
Like yoga and Sankhya, Jainism believes in a number of individual selves bound by their individual karma.
Only through the reduction of karmic influences and the exhaustion of collected karma can one become purified and released.
Early Jain yoga seems to have been divided into several types, including meditation, abandonment of the body (kāyotsarga), contemplation, and reflection (bhāvanā).
Buddhist yoga.
Buddhist yoga encompasses a variety of methods which aim to develop the 37 aids to awakening.
Its ultimate goal is bodhi (awakening) or nirvana (cessation), traditionally seen as the permanent end of suffering (dukkha) and rebirth.
Buddhist texts use a number of terms for spiritual praxis in addition to yoga, such as "bhāvanā" ("development") and "jhāna/dhyāna".
In early Buddhism, yoga practices included: 
These meditations were seen as supported by the other elements of the Noble Eightfold Path, such as ethics, right exertion, sense restraint and right view.
Two mental qualities are said to be indispensable for yoga practice in Buddhism: "samatha" (calm, stability) and "vipassanā" (insight, clear seeing).
"Samatha" is a stable, relaxed mind, associated with "samadhi" (mental unification, focus) and "dhyana" (a state of meditative absorption).
"Vipassanā" is insight or penetrative understanding into the true nature of phenomena, also defined as "seeing things as they truly are" ("yathābhūtaṃ darśanam").
A unique feature of classical Buddhism is its understanding of all phenomena ("dhammas") as being empty of a self.
Later developments in Buddhist traditions led to innovations in yoga practice.
The conservative Theravada school developed new ideas on meditation and yoga in its later works, the most influential of which is the "Visuddhimagga".
Mahayana meditation teachings may be seen in the "Yogācārabhūmi-Śāstra", compiled c. 4th century.
Mahayana also developed and adopted yoga methods such as the use of mantras and dharani, pure land practices aiming at rebirth in a pure land or buddhafield, and visualization.
Chinese Buddhism developed the Chan practice of Koan introspection and Hua Tou.
Tantric Buddhism developed and adopted tantric methods which are the basis of the Tibetan Buddhist yoga systems, including deity yoga, guru yoga, the six yogas of Naropa, Kalacakra, Mahamudra and Dzogchen.
Classical yoga.
What is often referred to as classical yoga, ashtanga yoga, or "rāja yoga" is primarily the yoga outlined in the dualistic "Yoga Sutras of Patanjali".
The origins of classical yoga are unclear, although early discussions of the term appear in the Upanishads.
"Rāja yoga" (yoga of kings) originally denoted the ultimate goal of yoga; "samadhi", but was popularised by Vivekananda as a common name for ashtanga yoga, the eight limbs attain samadhi as described in the "Yoga Sutras".
Yoga philosophy came to be regarded as a distinct orthodox school ("darsanas") of Hinduism in the second half of the first millennium CE.
Classical yoga incorporates epistemology, metaphysics, ethical practices, systematic exercises and self-development for body, mind and spirit.
Its epistemology ("pramana") and metaphysics are similar to the Sāṅkhya school.
The Classical yoga's metaphysics, like Sāṅkhya's, primarily posits two distinct realities: "prakriti" (nature, the eternal and active unconscious source of the material world composed of three Gunas) and "puruṣa" (consciousness), the plural consciousnesses which are the intelligent principles of the world.
Moksha (liberation) results from the isolation ("kaivalya)" of "puruṣa" from "prakirti," and is achieved through meditation, stilling one's thought waves ("citta vritti") and resting in pure awareness of "puruṣa."
Unlike Sāṅkhya, which takes a non-theistic approach, the yoga school of Hinduism accepts a "personal, yet essentially inactive, deity" or "personal god" (Ishvara).
In Advaita Vedanta.
Vedanta is a varied tradition, with a number of sub-schools and philosophical views.
It focuses on the study of the Upanishads and the "Brahma Sutras" (one of its early texts), about gaining spiritual knowledge of Brahman: the unchanging, absolute reality.
One of the earliest and most influential sub-traditions of Vedanta is Advaita Vedanta, which posits non-dualistic monism.
It emphasizes jñāna yoga (yoga of knowledge), which aims at realizing the identity of one's atman (individual consciousness) with Brahman (the Absolute consciousness).
The most influential thinker of this school is Adi Shankara (8th century), who wrote commentaries and other works on jñāna yoga.
In Advaita Vedanta, jñāna is attained from scripture, one's guru, and through a process of listening to (and meditating on) teachings.
Qualities such as discrimination, renunciation, tranquility, temperance, dispassion, endurance, faith, attention, and a longing for knowledge and freedom are also desirable.
Yoga in Advaita is a "meditative exercise of withdrawal from the particular and identification with the universal, leading to contemplation of oneself as the most universal, namely, Consciousness".
"Yoga Vasistha" is an influential Advaita text which uses short stories and anecdotes to illustrate its ideas.
Teaching seven stages of yoga practice, it was a major reference for medieval Advaita Vedanta yoga scholars and one of the most popular texts on Hindu yoga before the 12th century.
Another text which teaches yoga from an Advaita point of view is the "Yoga Yajnavalkya."
Tantric yoga.
According to Samuel, Tantra is a contested concept.
Tantra yoga may be described as practices in 9th to 10th century Buddhist and Hindu (Saiva, Shakti) texts which included yogic practices with elaborate deity visualizations using geometric arrays and drawings (mandalas), male and (particularly) female deities, life-stage-related rituals, the use of chakras and mantras, and sexual techniques aimed at aiding one's health, longevity and liberation.
Hatha yoga.
Hatha yoga focuses on physical and mental strength-building exercises and postures described primarily in three Hindu texts: 
Some scholars include Gorakshanath's 11th-century "Goraksha Samhita" on the list, since Gorakshanath is considered responsible for popularizing present-day hatha yoga.
Vajrayana Buddhism, founded by the Indian Mahasiddhas, has a series of asanas and pranayamas (such as tummo) which resemble hatha yoga.
Laya and kundalini yoga.
Laya and kundalini yoga, closely associated with hatha yoga, are often presented as independent approaches.
According to Georg Feuerstein, laya yoga (yoga of dissolution or merging) "makes meditative absorption ("laya") its focus.
The laya-yogin seeks to transcend all memory traces and sensory experiences by dissolving the microcosm, the mind, in the transcendental Self-Consciousness."
Laya yoga has a number of techniques which include listening to the "inner sound" ("nada"), mudras such as Khechari and Shambhavi mudra, and awakening kundalini (body energy).
Kundalini yoga aims to awaken bodily and cosmic energy with breath and body techniques, uniting them with universal consciousness.
A common teaching method awakens kundalini in the lowest chakra and guides it through the central channel to unite with the absolute consciousness in the highest chakra, at the top of the head.
Reception by other religions.
Christianity.
Some Christians integrate physical aspects of yoga, stripped from the spiritual roots of Hinduism, and other aspects of Eastern spirituality with prayer, meditation and Jesus-centric affirmations.
The practice also includes renaming poses in English (rather than using the original Sanskrit terms), and abandoning involved Hindu mantras as well as the philosophy of Yoga; Yoga is associated and reframed into Christianity.
This has drawn charges of cultural appropriation from various Hindu groups; scholars remain skeptical.
Previously, the Roman Catholic Church, and some other Christian organizations have expressed concerns and disapproval with respect to some eastern and New Age practices that include yoga and meditation.
In 1989 and 2003, the Vatican issued two documents: "Aspects of Christian meditation" and "A Christian reflection on the New Age," that were mostly critical of eastern and New Age practices.
The 2003 document was published as a 90-page handbook detailing the Vatican's position.
The Vatican warned that concentration on the physical aspects of meditation "can degenerate into a cult of the body" and that equating bodily states with mysticism "could also lead to psychic disturbance and, at times, to moral deviations."
Such has been compared to the early days of Christianity, when the church opposed the gnostics' belief that salvation came not through faith but through mystical inner knowledge.
The letter also says, "one can see if and how [prayer] might be enriched by meditation methods developed in other religions and cultures" but maintains the idea that "there must be some fit between the nature of [other approaches to] prayer and Christian beliefs about ultimate reality."
Some fundamentalist Christian organizations consider yoga to be incompatible with their religious background, considering it a part of the New Age movement inconsistent with Christianity.
Islam.
Early-11th-century Persian scholar Al-Biruni visited India, lived with Hindus for 16 years, and (with their help) translated several Sanskrit works into Arabic and Persian; one of these was Patanjali's "Yoga Sutras".
Although Al-Biruni's translation preserved many core themes of Patañjali's yoga philosophy, some sutras and commentaries were restated for consistency with monotheistic Islamic theology.
Al-Biruni's version of the "Yoga Sutras" reached Persia and the Arabian Peninsula by about 1050.
During the 16th century, the hatha yoga text "Amritakunda" was translated into Arabic and Persian.
Yoga was, however, not accepted by mainstream Sunni and Shia Islam.
Minority Islamic sects such as the mystic Sufi movement, particularly in South Asia, adopted Indian yoga postures and breath control.
Muhammad Ghawth, a 16th-century Shattari Sufi and translator of yoga text, was criticized for his interest in yoga and persecuted for his Sufi beliefs.
Malaysia's top Islamic body imposed a legally-enforceable 2008 fatwa prohibiting Muslims from practicing yoga, saying that it had elements of Hinduism and its practice was haram as blasphemy.
Malaysian Muslims who had been practicing yoga for years called the decision "insulting."
Sisters in Islam, a Malaysian women's-rights group, expressed disappointment and said that yoga was a form of exercise.
Malaysia's prime minister clarified that yoga as exercise is permissible, but the chanting of religious mantras is not.
The Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) imposed a 2009 fatwa banning yoga because it contains Hindu elements.
These fatwas have been criticized by Darul Uloom Deoband, a Deobandi Islamic seminary in India.
Similar fatwas banning yoga for its link to Hinduism were imposed by Grand Mufti Ali Gomaa in Egypt in 2004, and by Islamic clerics in Singapore earlier.
According to Iran's yoga association, the country had about 200 yoga centres in May 2014.
One-quarter were in the capital, Tehran, where groups could be seen practising in parks; conservatives were opposed.
In May 2009, Turkish Directorate of Religious Affairs head Ali Bardakoğlu discounted personal-development techniques such as reiki and yoga as commercial ventures which could lead to extremism.
According to Bardakoğlu, reiki and yoga could be a form of proselytizing at the expense of Islam.
Nouf Marwaai brought yoga to Saudi Arabia in 2017, contributing to making it legal and recognized despite being allegedly threatened by her community who asserts yoga as "un-Islamic".
Sattvic diet 
Sattvic diet is a diet based on foods that contain one of the three yogic qualities (guna) known as sattva.
In this system of dietary classification, foods that decrease the energy of the body are considered "tamasic", while those that increase the energy of the body are considered "rajasic".
A sattvic diet is sometimes referred to as a yogic diet in modern literature.
A "sattvic" diet shares the qualities of sattva, some of which include "pure, essential, natural, vital, energy-containing, clean, conscious, true, honest, wise".
A sattvic diet can also exemplify "Ahimsa", the principle of not causing harm to other living beings.
This is one reason yogis often follow a vegetarian diet.
A sattvic diet is a regimen that places emphasis on seasonal foods, fruits if one has no sugar problems, nuts, seeds, oils, ripe vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and non-meat based proteins.
Dairy products are recommended when the cow is fed and milked appropriately.
In ancient and medieval era Yoga literature, the concept discussed is "Mitahara", which literally means "moderation in eating".
A sattvic diet is one type of treatment recommended in ayurvedic literature.
Etymology.
"Sattvic" is derived from () which is a Sanskrit word.
"Sattva" is a complex concept in Indian philosophy, used in many contexts, and it means one that is "pure, essence, nature, vital, energy, clean, conscious, strong, courage, true, honest, wise, rudiment of life".
"Sattva" is one of three "gunas" (quality, peculiarity, tendency, attribute, property).
The other two qualities are considered to be "rajas" (agitated, passionate, moving, emotional, trendy) and "tamas" (dark, destructive, spoiled, ignorant, stale, inertia, unripe, unnatural, weak, unclean).
The concept that contrasts with and is opposed to "sattva" is Tamas.
A sattvic diet is thus meant to include food and eating habit that is "pure, essential, natural, vital, energy-giving, clean, conscious, true, honest, wise".
Ancient literature.
Eating agreeable (sattvic) food and eating in moderation have been emphasized throughout ancient literature.
For example, the Tamil poet-philosopher Valluvar insists this in the 95th chapter of his work, the Tirukkural.
He hints, "Assured of digestion and truly hungry, eat with care agreeable food" (verse 944) and "Agreeable food in moderation ensures absence of pain" (verse 945).
Yoga includes recommendations on eating habits.
Both the Śāṇḍilya Upanishad and Svātmārāma, an Indian yogi who lived during the 15th century CE, state that "Mitahara" (eating in moderation) is an important part of yoga practice.
It is one of the Yamas (virtuous self restraints).
These texts while discussing yoga diet, however, make no mention of sattvic diet.
In Yoga diet context, the virtue of "Mitahara" is one where the yogi is aware of the quantity and quality of food and drinks he or she consumes, takes neither too much nor too little, and suits it to one's health condition and needs.
The application of sattva and tamas concepts to food is a later and relatively new extension to the "Mitahara" virtue in Yoga literature.
Verses 1.57 through 1.63 of Hatha Yoga Pradipika suggest that taste cravings should not drive one's eating habits; rather, the best diet is one that is tasty, nutritious and likable, as well as sufficient to meet the needs of one's body.
It recommends that one must "eat only when one feels hungry" and "neither overeat nor eat to completely fill the capacity of one’s stomach; rather leave a quarter portion empty and fill three quarters with quality food and fresh water".
The Hathayoga Pradipika suggests ‘‘mitahara’’ regimen of a yogi avoids foods with excessive amounts of sour, salt, bitterness, oil, spice burn, unripe vegetables, fermented foods or alcohol.
The practice of "Mitahara", in Hathayoga Pradipika, includes avoiding stale, impure and tamasic foods, and consuming moderate amounts of fresh, vital and sattvic foods.
Sattvic foods.
Nuts, seeds, and oils.
Fresh nuts and seeds that have not been overly roasted and salted are good additions to the sattvic diet in small portions.
Choices include almonds (especially when soaked in water overnight and then peeled), hemp seeds, coconuts, pine nuts, walnuts, sesame seeds (til), pumpkin seeds and flax seeds.
Red palm oil is considered to be highly sattvic.
Oils should be of good quality and cold-pressed.
Some choices are olive oil, sesame oil and flax oil.
Most oils should only be eaten in their raw state.
Fruit.
Fruits are an important part of the sattvic diet and all fruits are sattvic.
They have a great importance because they contain all necessary nutrients and minerals, also they contain natural and healthy sugar.
Dairy.
Milk must be obtained from an animal that has a spacious outdoor environment, an abundance of pasture to feed on, water to drink, is treated with love and care, and is not pregnant.
The milk may only be collected once the mother's calf has its share.
Dairy products like yogurt and cheese (paneer) must be made that day, from milk obtained that day.
Butter must be fresh daily as well, and raw; but ghee (clarified butter) can be aged forever, and is great for cooking.
Freshness is key with dairy.
Milk should be freshly milked from a cow.
Milk that is not consumed fresh can be refrigerated for one to two days in its raw state, but must be brought to a boil before drinking, and drunk while still hot/warm.
Vegetables.
Most mild vegetables are considered sattvic.
Pungent vegetables like hot peppers (rajasic), leek, garlic and onion (which are tamasic) are excluded, including mushrooms, as all fungi are also considered tamasic.
Some consider tomatoes, peppers, and aubergines as sattvic, but most consider the "Allium" family (garlic, onion, leeks, shallots), as well as fungus (yeasts, molds, and mushrooms) as not sattvic.
Sweet potatoes and rice are considered highly sattvic.
The classification of whether something is sattvic or not is defined largely by the different schools of thought, and – even then – individually, depending on the understanding and needs of practitioners.
Sometimes the given nature of certain foods can be neutralised by careful preparation.
A practice is to drink freshly made vegetable juices for their prana, live enzymes, and easy absorption.
Whole grains.
Whole grains provide nourishment.
Some include organic rice, whole wheat, spelt, oatmeal and barley.
Sometimes the grains are lightly roasted before cooking to remove some of their heavy quality.
Yeasted breads are not recommended, unless toasted.
Wheat and other grains can be sprouted before cooking as well.
Some preparations are khichdi (brown or white basmati rice cooked with whole or split mung beans, ghee and mild spices), kheer (rice cooked with milk and sweetened), chapatis (non-leavened whole wheat flat bread), porridge (sometimes made very watery and cooked with herbs), and bread (sprouted grain bread).
Sometimes yogis will fast from grains during special practices.
Legumes.
Mung beans, lentils, yellow split peas, chickpeas, aduki beans, common beans and bean sprouts are considered sattvic if well prepared.
In general, the smaller the bean, the easier to digest.
Preparations include splitting, peeling, grinding, soaking, sprouting, cooking and spicing.
Legumes combined with whole grains can offer a complete protein source.
Some yogis consider the mung bean to be the only sattvic legume.
Convalescent food in ayurvedic diet includes yusha soups made with lentils.
Sweeteners.
Most yogis use raw honey (often in combination with dairy), jaggery, or raw sugar (not refined).
Palm jaggery and coconut palm sugar are other choices.
Others use alternative sweeteners, such as stevia or stevia leaf.
In some traditions, sugar and/or honey are excluded from the diet, along with all other sweeteners.
Spices.
Sattvic spices are herbs/leaves, including basil and coriander.
All other spices are considered either rajasic or tamasic.
However, over time, certain Hindu sects have tried to classify a few spices as Sattvic.
Spices in the new sattvic list may include cardamom (yealakaai in Tamil, Elaichi in Hindi), cinnamon (Ilavangapattai in Tamil, Dalchini in Hindi), cumin (seeragam in Tamil, Jeera in Hindi), fennel (soambu in Tamil, Saunf in Hindi), fenugreek (venthaiyam in Tamil, Methi in Hindi), black pepper ("Piper nigrum") also known as 'Kali mirch' in Hindi, fresh ginger (ingi in Tamil, Adrak in Hindi) and turmeric (Manjai in Tamil, Haldi in Hindi).
Rajasic spices like red pepper (kudaimilagai in Tamil, 'Shimla mirch' in Hindi) are normally excluded, but are sometimes used in small amounts, both to clear channels blocked by mucus and to counter tamas.
Salt is good in strict moderation, but only unrefined salts, like Himalayan salt or unbleached sea salt, not iodized salt.
Sattvic herbs.
Other herbs are used to directly support sattva in the mind and in meditation.
These include ashwagandha, bacopa, calamus, gotu kola, ginkgo, jatamansi, purnarnava, shatavari, saffron, shankhapushpi, tulsi and rose.
Rajasic (stimulant) foods.
Stimulant foods, also called mutative foods, mutable foods or rajasic foods, are foods that often provoke mental restlessness.
They are not completely beneficial, nor are they harmful, to body or mind.
Foods that cannot be categorized as either sentient or static are classified in this food group.
These foods are thought by some to cause aggressive and dominating thoughts, especially towards others.
Stimulant foods energize and develop the manipura (navel) chakra and body but do not promote advancement in the higher chakras.
Such foods include: caffeinated drinks such as coffee, tea, cola drinks, energy drinks, brown or black chocolate, ginkgo biloba, spicy food, unfertilized eggs, food that is pungent, very much salty, bitter or is not balanced in taste.
Tamasic (sedative) foods.
Sedative foods, also called static foods, or tamasic foods, are foods whose consumption, according to Yoga, are harmful to both mind and body.
Harm to mind includes anything that will lead to a duller, less refined state of consciousness.
Bodily harm includes any foods that will cause detrimental stress to any physical organ, directly or indirectly (via any physical imbalance).
They are, however, sometimes necessary during times of great physical stress and pain.
They help dull the pain and lower consciousness, allowing the body to repair itself.
Such static foods may be deemed necessary in times of war or great distress.
Static foods stimulate and strengthen the lower two chakras, but will not assist in beneficial development of the higher chakras.
In fact, they are usually detrimental to the advancement of the higher chakras.
Such foods sometimes include: meat, fish, fertilized eggs, onion, garlic, scallion, leek, chive, mushroom, alcoholic beverage, durian (fruit), blue cheese, opium, and stale food.
Food that has remained for more than three hours (i.e., one yām), is according to chapter 17 of the Bhagavad Gita, in the tamasic mode.
Incompatible foods.
Incompatible foods (viruddha) are considered to be a cause of many diseases.
In the "Charaka Samhita", a list of food combinations considered incompatible in the sattvic system is given.
P.V. Sharma states that such incompatibilities may not have influence on a person who is strong, exercises sufficiently, and has a good digestive system.
Examples of combinations that are considered incompatible include: 
Patanjali 
Patanjali (), also called Gonardiya or Gonikaputra, was a Hindu author, mystic and philosopher.
Very little is known about him, and while no one knows exactly when he lived, estimates from analysis of his works suggest that it was between the 2nd and 4th centuries CE.
He is believed to be an author and compiler of a number of Sanskrit works.
The greatest of these are the "Yoga Sutras", a classical yoga text.
There is speculation as to whether the sage Patañjali is the author of all the works attributed to him, as there are a number of known historical authors of the same name.
A great deal of scholarship has been devoted over the last century to the issue of the historicity or identity of this author or these authors.
Identities.
Amongst the more important authors called Patañjali are: 
Patanjali continues to be honoured with invocations and shrines in some forms of modern postural yoga, such as Iyengar Yoga and Ashtānga Vinyāsa Yoga.
Name.
According to Monier Monier-Williams, the word "Patañjali" is a compound name from "patta" (Sanskrit: पत, "falling, flying") and "añj" (अञ्ज्, "honor, celebrate, beautiful") or "añjali" (अञ्जलि, "reverence, joining palms of the hand").
Life.
Many scholars including Louis Renou have suggested that the Patañjali who wrote on Yoga was a different person than the Patanjali who wrote a commentary on Panini's grammar.
In 1914, James Wood proposed that they were the same person.
In 1922, Surendranath Dasgupta presented a series of arguments to tentatively propose that the famed Grammar text and the Yoga text author may be identical.
The view that these were likely two different authors is generally accepted, but some Western scholars consider them as a single entity.
Some in the Indian tradition have held that one Patañjali wrote treatises on grammar, medicine and yoga.
This has been memorialised in a verse by Bhoja at the start of his commentary on the Yogasutras called "Rājamārttanda" (11th century), and the following verse found in Shivarama's 18th-century text: 
This tradition is discussed by Meulenbeld who traces this "relatively late" idea back to Bhoja (11th century), who was perhaps influenced by a verse by Bhartṛhari (ca. 5th century) that speaks of an expert in yoga, medicine and grammar who, however, is not named.
No known Sanskrit text prior to the 10th century states that the one and the same Patanjali was behind all the three treatises.
The sage Patañjali is said to have attained Samadhi through yogic meditation at the Brahmapureeswarar Temple located at Tirupattur, Tamil Nadu, India.
Jeeva Samadhi of sage Patanjali, which is now an enclosed meditation hall, can be seen near the Brahma's shrine within Brahmapureeswarar Temple complex.
Grammatical tradition.
In the grammatical tradition, Patañjali is believed to have lived in the second century BCE.
He wrote a "Mahabhasya" on Panini's sutras, in a form that quoted the commentary of Kātyāyana's "vārttikas".
This is a major influential work on Sanskrit grammar and linguistics.
The dating of Patanjali and his "Mahabhasya" is established by a combination of evidence, those from the Maurya Empire period, the historical events mentioned in the examples he used to explain his ideas, the chronology of ancient classical Sanskrit texts that respect his teachings, and the mention of his text or his name in ancient Indian literature.
Of the three ancient grammarians, the chronological dating of Patanjali to mid 2nd century B.C. is considered as "reasonably accurate" by mainstream scholarship.
The text influenced Buddhist grammatical literature, as well as memoirs of travellers to India.
For example, the Chinese pilgrim I-tsing mentions that the "Mahabhasya" is studied in India and advanced scholars learn it in three years.
Yoga tradition.
In the Yoga tradition, Patañjali is a revered name.
This Patañjali's oeuvre comprises the sutras about Yoga ("Yogasūtra") and the commentary integral to the sutras, called the "Bhāṣya".
Some consider the sutras and the Bhaṣya to have had different authors, the commentary being ascribed to "an editor" (Skt. "vyāsa").
According to Phillipp Maas, the same person named Patanjali composed the sutras and the "Bhāṣya" commentary.
Radhakrishnan and Moore attribute the text to the grammarian Patañjali, dating it as 2nd century BCE, during the Maurya Empire (322–185 BCE).
Maas estimates Patañjali's Yogasutra's date to be about 400 CE, based on tracing the commentaries on it published in the first millennium CE.
Edwin Bryant, on the other hand, surveys the major commentators in his translation of the "Yoga Sūtras".
He states that "most scholars date the text shortly after the turn of the Common Era (circa first to second century), but that it has been placed as early as several centuries before that."
Bryant concludes that "A number of scholars have dated the "Yoga Sūtras" as late as the fourth or fifth century C.E., but these arguments have all been challenged", and late chronology for this Patanjali and his text are problematic.
Tamil Saivite legend.
Regarding his early years, a Tamil Saiva Siddhanta tradition from around 10th century AD holds that Patañjali learned Yoga along with seven other disciples from the great Yogic Guru Nandhi Deva, as stated in Tirumular's "Tirumandiram" (Tantra 1).
His Samadhi is said to be at Rameswaram Shiva temple and a shrine for him still exists in the temple.
"Nandhi arulPetra Nadharai Naadinom" 
"Nandhigal Nalvar Siva Yoga MaaMuni" 
"Mandru thozhuda Patañjali Vyakramar" 
"Endrivar Ennodu (Thirumoolar) Enmarumaame" 
Translation 
We sought the feet of the God who graced Nandikesvara 
The Four Nandhis,  
Sivayoga Muni, Patañjali, Vyaghrapada and I (Thirumoolar) 
We were these eight.
Works.
Whether the two works, the Yoga Sutras and the Mahābhāṣya, are by the same author has been the subject of considerable debate.
The authorship of the two is first attributed to the same person in Bhojadeva's "Rajamartanda", a relatively late (10th century) commentary on the Yoga Sutras, as well as several subsequent texts.
As for the texts themselves, the Yoga Sutra iii.44 cites a sutra as that from Patanjali by name, but this line itself is not from the Mahābhāṣya.
This 10th-century legend of single-authorship is doubtful.
The literary styles and contents of the Yogasūtras and the Mahābhāṣya are entirely different, and the only work on medicine attributed to Patañjali is lost.
Sources of doubt include the lack of cross-references between the texts, and no mutual awareness of each other, unlike other cases of multiple works by (later) Sanskrit authors.
Also, some elements in the Yoga Sutras may date from as late as the 4th century C.E., but such changes may be due to divergent authorship, or due to later additions which are not atypical in the oral tradition.
Most scholars refer to both works as "by Patanjali", without meaning that they are by the same author.
In addition to the Mahābhāṣya and Yoga Sūtras, the 11th-century commentary on Charaka by the Bengali scholar Chakrapani Datta, and the 16th-century text "Patanjalicarita" ascribes to Patañjali a medical text called the "Carakapratisaṃskṛtaḥ" (now lost) which is apparently a revision ("pratisaṃskṛtaḥ") of the medical treatise by Caraka.
While there is a short treatise on yoga in the medical work called the Carakasaṃhitā (by Caraka), towards the end of the chapter called śārīrasthāna, it is notable for not bearing much resemblance to the Yoga Sūtras, and in fact presents a form of eightfold yoga that is completely different from that laid out by Patañjali in the Yoga Sūtras and the commentary Yogasūtrabhāṣya.
Yoga Sūtra.
The "Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali" are 196 Indian sutras (aphorisms) on Yoga.
It was the most translated ancient Indian text in the medieval era, having been translated into about forty Indian languages and two non-Indian languages: Old Javanese and Arabic.
The text fell into obscurity for nearly 700 years from the 12th to 19th century, and made a comeback in late 19th century due to the efforts of Swami Vivekananda and others.
It gained prominence again as a comeback classic in the 20th century.
Before the 20th century, history indicates the Indian yoga scene was dominated by other Yoga texts such as the "Bhagavad Gita", "Yoga Vasistha" and "Yoga Yajnavalkya".
Scholars consider the "Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali" formulations as one of the foundations of classical Yoga philosophy of Hinduism.
The ("great commentary") of Patañjali on the of is a major early exposition on Pāṇini, along with the somewhat earlier "Varttika" by Katyayana.
Patanjali relates to how words and meanings are associated – Patanjali claims "shabdapramâNaH" – that the evidentiary value of words is inherent in them, and not derived externally – the word-meaning association is natural.
These issues in the word-meaning relation (symbol) would be elaborated in the Sanskrit linguistic tradition, in debates between the Mimamsa, Nyaya and Buddhist schools over the next fifteen centuries.
Sphota.
Patanjali also defines an early notion of sphota, which would be elaborated considerably by later Sanskrit linguists like Bhartrihari.
In Patanjali, a "sphoTa" (from "sphuT", spurt/burst) is the invariant quality of speech.
The noisy element ("dhvani", audible part) can be long or short, but the sphoTa remains unaffected by individual speaker differences.
Thus, a single letter or 'sound' ("varNa") such as "k", "p" or "a" is an abstraction, distinct from variants produced in actual enunciation.
This concept has been linked to the modern notion of phoneme, the minimum distinction that defines semantically distinct sounds.
Thus a phoneme is an abstraction for a range of sounds.
However, in later writings, especially in Bhartrihari (6th century CE), the notion of "sphoTa" changes to become more of a mental state, preceding the actual utterance, akin to the lemma.
Patañjali's writings also elaborate some principles of morphology ("prakriyā").
In the context of elaborating on Pāṇini's aphorisms, he also discusses Kātyāyana's commentary, which are also aphoristic and "sūtra"-like; in the later tradition, these were transmitted as embedded in Patañjali's discussion.
In general, he defends many positions of Pāṇini which were interpreted somewhat differently in Katyayana.
Metaphysics as grammatical motivation.
Unlike Pāṇini's objectives in the Ashtyadhyayi, which is to distinguish correct forms and meanings from incorrect ones ("shabdaunushasana"), Patanjali's objectives are more metaphysical.
These include the correct recitations of the scriptures ("Agama"), maintaining the purity of texts ("raksha"), clarifying ambiguity ("asamdeha"), and also the pedagogic goal of providing an easier learning mechanism ("laghu").
This stronger metaphysical bent has also been indicated by some as one of the unifying themes between the Yoga Sutras and the Mahābhāṣya, although a close examination 
of actual Sanskrit usage by Woods showed no similarities in language or terminology.
The text of the "" was first critically edited by the 19th-century orientalist Franz Kielhorn, who also developed philological criteria for distinguishing Kātyāyana's "voice" from Patañjali's.
Subsequently, a number of other editions have come out, the 1968 text and translation by S.D. Joshi and J.H.F. Roodbergen often being considered definitive.
Regrettably, the latter work is incomplete.
Patanjali is often stated as having claimed there was a hostility between the orthodox Brahminic ("Astika") groups and the heterodox, "nAstika" groups (Buddhism, Jainism, and atheists), like that between a mongoose and a snake.
Nathan McGovern argues Patanjali never used this mongoose-snake analogy.
Patanjali also sheds light on contemporary events, commenting on the recent Greek incursion, and also on several tribes that lived in the Northwest regions of the subcontinent.
Patanjalatantra.
Patanjali is also the reputed author of a medical text called "Patanjalah", also called "Patanjala" or "Patanjalatantra".
This text is quoted in many yoga and health-related Indian texts.
Patanjali is called a medical authority in a number of Sanskrit texts such as "Yogaratnakara", "Yogaratnasamuccaya", "Padarthavijnana", "Cakradatta bhasya".
Some of these quotes are unique to "Patanjala", but others are also found in major Hindu medical treatises such as "Charaka Samhita" and "Sushruta Samhita".
There is a fourth scholar also named Patanjali, who likely lived in 8th-century and wrote a commentary on "Charaka Samhita" and this text is called "Carakavarttika".
The two medical scholars named Patanjali may be the same person, but generally accepted to be completely different person than the Patanjali who wrote the Sanskrit grammar classic "Mahabhasya".
Legacy.
Patanjali is honoured with invocations and shrines in some modern schools of yoga, including Iyengar Yoga and Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga.
The yoga scholar David Gordon White writes that yoga teacher training often includes "mandatory instruction" in the "Yoga Sutra".
White calls this "curious to say the least", since the text is in his view essentially irrelevant to "yoga as it is taught and practiced today", commenting that the "Yoga Sutra" is "nearly devoid of discussion of postures, stretching, and breathing".
Three Yogas 
The Three Yogas or Trimārga are three soteriological paths mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita for the liberation of human spirit.
They are: 
A "fourth yoga" is sometimes added:  
Discussion.
Hindu philosophers of the medieval period have tried to explain the nature of these three paths and the relation between them.
Shankara tended to focus on "jñāna-yoga" exclusively, which he interpreted as the acquisition of knowledge or "vidya".
He considered "karma-yoga" to be inferior.
The fact that he wrote some of the most famous hymns for personal gods such as Shiva, Vishnu, Devi, Ganesha and Subrahmanya underlines his affinity to Bhakti-Yoga.
The 12th-century philosopher Ramanuja considered the three yogas by interpreting his predecessor Yamunacharya.
In Ramanujam's interpretation, "Bhakti yoga" appears to be the direct path to "moksha", which is however available only to those whose inner faculties have already been trained by both "Karma yoga" and "Jnana yoga".
A "fourth yoga" is sometimes added, Raja Yoga or "the Path of Meditation".
This is the classical "Yoga" presented in the "Yoga Sutras of Patanjali".
Patanjali's system came to be known as "Raja Yoga" (Royal Yoga) retro-actively, in about the 15th century, as the term "Yoga" had become popular for the general concept of a "religious path".
The systematic presentation of Hindu monotheism as divided into these four paths or "Yogas" is modern, advocated by Swami Vivekananda from the 1890s in his book "Raja Yoga".
They are presented as four paths to God suitable for four human temperaments, viz. the active, the emotional, the philosophical and the mystic.
Yoga (philosophy) 
Yoga philosophy is one of the six major orthodox schools of Hinduism, though it is only at the end of the first millennium CE that Yoga is mentioned as a separate school of thought in Indian texts, distinct from Samkhya.
Ancient, medieval and most modern literature often refers to Yoga-philosophy simply as "Yoga".
A systematic collection of ideas of Yoga is found in the "Yoga Sutras of Patanjali", a key text of Yoga which has influenced all other schools of Indian philosophy.
The metaphysics of Yoga is Samkhya's dualism, in which the universe is conceptualized as composed of two realities: "Puruṣa" (witness-consciousness) and "Prakṛti" (nature).
"Jiva" (a living being) is considered as a state in which "puruṣa" is bonded to "Prakṛti" in some form, in various permutations and combinations of various elements, senses, feelings, activity and mind.
During the state of imbalance or ignorance, one or more constituents overwhelm the others, creating a form of bondage.
The end of this bondage is called liberation, or "mokṣa", by both the Yoga and Samkhya schools of Hinduism, and can be attained by insight and self-restraint.
The ethical theory of Yoga-philosophy is based on Yamas and Niyama, as well as elements of the Guṇa theory of Samkhya.
The epistemology of Yoga-philosophy, like the Sāmkhya school, relies on three of six "Pramanas" as the means of gaining reliable knowledge.
These include "Pratyakṣa" (perception), "Anumāṇa" (inference) and "Sabda" ("Āptavacana", word/testimony of reliable sources).
Yoga-philosophy differs from the closely related non-theistic/atheistic Samkhya school by incorporating the concept of a "personal, yet essentially inactive, deity" or "personal god" (Ishvara).
History.
Yoga-practice.
The origins of yoga-practice are unclear, but seems to have developed in ascetic milieus in the first millennium BCE.
Some of its earliest discussions and of proto-Samkhya ideas are found in 1st millennium BCE Indian texts such as the Katha Upanishad, the Shvetashvatara Upanishad and the Maitri Upanishad.
The root of the word "Yoga" is found in hymn 5.81.1 of the Rig Veda, a dedication to rising Sun-god in the morning (Savitri), interpreted as "yoke" or "yogically control".
The Rig Veda, however, does not describe Yoga philosophy with the same meaning or context as in medieval or modern times.
Early references to practices that later became part of Yoga-philosophy, are made in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the oldest Upanishad.
Gavin Flood translates it as, "...having become calm and concentrated, one perceives the self ("atman"), within oneself."
The practice of pranayama (consciously regulating breath) is mentioned in hymn 1.5.23 of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (c. ~ 900 BCE), and the practice of pratyahara (withdrawal of the senses) is mentioned in hymn 8.15 of Chandogya Upanishad (c. ~ 800-700 BCE).
The Katha Upanishad, dated to be from about the middle of the 1st millennium BCE, in verses 2.6.6 through 2.6.13 recommends a path to Self-knowledge akin to Samkhya, and calls this path "Yoga".
Yoga-practice is also mentioned in foundational texts of other orthodox schools such as the Vaisesikha Sutras, Nyaya Sutras and Brahma Sutras.
Separate darsana.
Yoga as a separate school of thought is mentioned in Indian texts from the end of the 1st millennium CE.
The systematic collection of ideas of the Yoga school of Hinduism is found in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.
After its circulation in the first half of the 1st millennium CE, many Indian scholars reviewed it, then published their "Bhāṣya" (notes and commentary) on it, which together form a canon of texts called the "Pātañjalayogaśāstra" ("The Treatise on Yoga of Patañjali").
Yoga as a separate school of philosophy has been included as one of the six orthodox schools in medieval era Indian texts; the other schools are Samkhya, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Mimamsa and Vedanta.
According to Bryant, 
There are numerous parallels in the concepts in the Samkhya school of Hinduism, Yoga and the Abhidharma schools of thought, particularly from the 2nd century BCE to the 1st century AD, notes Larson.
Patanjali's Yoga Sutras may be a synthesis of these three traditions.
From the Samkhya school of Hinduism, the Yoga Sutras adopt the "reflective discernment" ("adhyavasaya") of "prakrti" and "purusa" (dualism), its metaphysical rationalism, as well its three epistemic methods to gaining reliable knowledge.
From Abhidharma Buddhism's idea of "nirodhasamadhi", suggests Larson, the Yoga Sutras adopt the pursuit of an altered state of awareness, but unlike Buddhism, which believes that there is neither self nor soul, Yoga is physicalist and realist like Samkhya in believing that each individual has a self and soul.
The third concept that the Yoga Sutras synthesize into its philosophy is the ancient ascetic traditions of isolation, meditation and introspection.
Philosophy.
Yoga-philosophy is Samkhya.
In both, the foundational concepts include two realities: "Purusha" and "Prakriti".
The "Purusha" is defined as that reality which is pure consciousness and is devoid of thoughts or qualities.
The "Prakriti" is the empirical, phenomenal reality which includes matter and also mind, sensory organs and the sense of identity (self, soul).
A living being is held in both schools to be the union of matter and mind.
The Yoga school differs from the Samkhya school in its views on the ontology of "Purusha", on axiology and on soteriology.
Metaphysics.
The metaphysics of Yoga-Samkhya is a form of dualism.
It considers consciousness and matter, self/soul and body as two different realities.
The Samkhya-Yoga system espouses dualism between consciousness and matter by postulating two "irreducible, innate and independent realities: Purusha and Prakriti.
While the "Prakriti" is a single entity, the Samkhya-Yoga schools admit a plurality of the "Puruṣa"s in this world.
Unintelligent, unmanifest, uncaused, ever-active, imperceptible and eternal Prakriti is alone the final source of the world of objects.
The "Puruṣa" is considered as the conscious principle, a passive enjoyer ("bhokta") and the "Prakriti" is the enjoyed ("bhogya").
Samkhya-Yoga believes that the "Puruṣa" cannot be regarded as the source of inanimate world, because an intelligent principle cannot transform itself into the unconscious world.
This metaphysics is a pluralistic spiritualism, a form of realism built on the foundation of dualism.
Yoga-philosophy adopts the theory of Guṇa from Samkhya.
Guṇas theory states that three "gunas" (innate tendency, attributes) are present in different proportions in all beings, and these three are "sattva" guna (goodness, constructive, harmonious), "rajas" guna (passion, active, confused), and "tamas" guna (darkness, destructive, chaotic).
These three are present in every being but in different proportions, and the fundamental nature and psychological dispositions of beings is a consequence of the relative proportion of these three "gunas".
When "sattva" guna predominates an individual, the qualities of lucidity, wisdom, constructiveness, harmonious, and peacefulness manifest themselves; when rajas is predominant, attachment, craving, passion-driven activity and restlessness manifest; and when tamas predominates in an individual, ignorance, delusion, destructive behavior, lethargy, and suffering manifests.
The guṇas theory underpins the philosophy of mind in Yoga school of Hinduism.
The early scholars of Yoga philosophy, posit that the "Puruṣa" (consciousness) by its nature is sattva (constructive), while "Prakriti" (matter) by its nature is tamas (chaotic).
They further posit that individuals at birth have "buddhi" (intelligence, sattvic).
As life progresses and churns this "buddhi", it creates "asmita" or "ahamkara" (ego, rajasic).
When ego in turn is churned by life, "manas" (temper, mood, tamasic) is produced.
Together, "buddhi", "ahamkara" and "manas" interact and constitute "citta" (mind) in Yoga school of Hinduism.
Unrestrained modification of "citta" causes suffering.
A way of life that empowers one to become ever more aware of one's consciousness and spirituality innate in "buddhi", is the path to one's highest potential and a more serene, content, liberated life.
Patanjali's Yoga sutra begins, in verse 2 of Book 1, by defining Yoga as "restraining the "Citta" from "Vrittis"."
Soteriology.
Yoga school of Hinduism holds that ignorance is the cause of suffering and saṁsāra.
Liberation, like many other schools, is removal of ignorance, which is achieved through discriminative discernment, knowledge and self-awareness.
The "Yoga Sūtras" is Yoga school's treatise on how to accomplish this.
"Samādhi" is the state where ecstatic awareness develops, state Yoga scholars, and this is how one starts the process of becoming aware of Purusa and true Self.
It further claims that this awareness is eternal, and once this awareness is achieved, a person cannot ever cease being aware; this is moksha, the soteriological goal in Hinduism.
Book 3 of Patanjali's "Yogasutra" is dedicated to soteriological aspects of yoga philosophy.
Patanjali begins by stating that all limbs of yoga are necessary foundation to reaching the state of self-awareness, freedom and liberation.
He refers to the three last limbs of yoga as "sanyama", in verses III.4 to III.5, and calls it the technology for "discerning principle" and mastery of "citta" and self-knowledge.
In verse III.12, the Yogasutras state that this discerning principle then empowers one to perfect "sant" (tranquility) and "udita" (reason) in one's mind and spirit, through intentness.
This leads to one's ability to discern the difference between "sabda" (word), "artha" (meaning) and "pratyaya" (understanding), and this ability empowers one to compassionately comprehend the cry/speech of all living beings.
Once a yogi reaches this state of "sanyama", it leads to unusual powers, intuition, self-knowledge, freedoms and kaivalya, the soteriological goal of the yogi.
The benefits of Yoga philosophy of Hinduism is then summarized in verses III.46 to III.55 of Yogasutras, stating that the first 5 limbs leads to bodily perfections such as beauty, loveliness, strength and toughness; while the last 3 limbs through "sanyama" leads to mind and psychological perfections of perceptiveness, one's nature, mastery over egoism, discriminative knowledge of purity, self and soul.
This knowledge once reached is irreversible, states Yogasutra's Book IV.
Ethical rules.
Ethical rules in the texts of Yoga school of Hindu philosophy include both a theory of values through the observances of positive values and avoidance of negative, as well as an aesthetic theory on bliss from intrinsic and extrinsic perspectives.
The values to be observed are called Niyamas, while those to be avoided are referred in the Yamas in Yoga philosophy.
Over sixty different ancient and medieval era texts of Yoga philosophy discuss "Yamas" and "Niyamas".
The specific theory and list of values varies between the texts, however, "Ahimsa", "Satya", "Asteya", "Svādhyāya", "Kșhamā", and "Dayā" are among the predominantly discussed ethical concepts by majority of these texts.
The five yamas listed by Patañjali in "Yogasūtra" 2.30 are: 
Patanjali, in Book 2, explains how and why each of the above self restraints help in the personal growth of an individual.
For example, in verse II.35, Patanjali states that the virtue of nonviolence and non-injury to others (Ahimsa) leads to the abandonment of enmity, a state that leads the yogi to the perfection of inner and outer amity with everyone, everything.
Other texts of the Yoga school of Hinduism include Kṣamā (क्षमा, forgiveness), Dhṛti (धृति, fortitude, non-giving up in adversity), Dayā (दया, compassion), Ārjava (आर्जव, non-hypocrisy) and Mitāhāra (मितहार, measured diet).
The "Niyamas" part of theory of values in the Yoga school include virtuous habits, behaviors and observances.
The Yogasutra lists the niyamas as: 
As with "Yamas", Patanjali explains how and why each of the above "Niyamas" help in the personal growth of an individual.
For example, in verse II.42, Patanjali states that the virtue of contentment and acceptance of others as they are (Santoṣa) leads to the state where inner sources of joy matter most, and the craving for external sources of pleasant ceases.
Other texts of the Yoga school expanded the list of values under "Niyamas", to include behaviors such as Āstika (आस्तिक, belief in personal God, faith in Self, conviction that there is knowledge in Vedas/Upanishads), Dāna (दान , charity, sharing with others), "Hrī" (ह्री, remorse and acceptance of one's past/mistakes/ignorance, modesty) "Mati" (मति, think and reflect, reconcile conflicting ideas) and "Vrata" (व्रत, resolutions and vows, fast, pious observances).
Epistemology.
Yoga school, like Samkhya school, considers "Pratyakṣa" or "Dṛṣṭam" (direct sense perception), "Anumāna" (inference), and "Śabda" or "Āptavacana" (verbal testimony of the sages or shāstras) to be the only valid means of knowledge or "Pramana".
Unlike few other schools of Hinduism such as Advaita Vedanta, Yoga did not adopt the following three "Pramanas": "Upamāṇa" (comparison and analogy), "Arthāpatti" (postulation, deriving from circumstances) or "Anupalabdi" (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof).
God in Yoga school of Hinduism.
Yoga philosophy allows the concept of God, unlike the closely related Samkhya school of Hinduism which is non-theistic.
Hindu scholars such as the 8th century Adi Sankara, as well many modern academic scholars describe the Yoga school as "Samkya school with God."
The "Yoga Sutras of Patanjali" use the term "Isvara" in 11 verses: I.23 through I.29, II.1, II.2, II.32 and II.45.
Ever since the Sutras' release, Hindu scholars have debated and commented on who or what is "Isvara".
These commentaries range from defining "Isvara" as a "personal god" to a "special self" to "anything that has spiritual significance to the individual".
Whicher explains that while Patanjali's terse verses can be interpreted both as theistic or non-theistic, Patanjali's concept of "Isvara" in Yoga philosophy functions as a "transformative catalyst or guide for aiding the yogin on the path to spiritual emancipation".
Patanjali defines "Isvara" (Sanskrit: ईश्वर) in verse 24 of Book 1, as "a special Self (पुरुषविशेष, "puruṣa-viśeṣa")", 
Sanskrit:  
– Yoga Sutras I.24 
This sutra of Yoga philosophy of Hinduism adds the characteristics of "Isvara" as that special Self which is unaffected (अपरामृष्ट, "aparamrsta") by one's obstacles/hardships (क्लेश, "klesha"), one's circumstances created by the past or by one's current actions (कर्म, "karma"), one's life fruits (विपाक, "vipâka"), and one's psychological dispositions or intentions (आशय, ashaya).
Text sources.
The most studied ancient and medieval era texts of the Yoga school of philosophy include those by Patanjali, Bhaskara, Haribhadra (Jain scholar), Bhoja, and Hemachandra.
References to the teachings of the Yoga school of Hinduism abound in ancient Indian texts of other orthodox schools of Hinduism, for example, verse 5.2.17 of Vaisheshika Sutra by Kanada, belonging to the Vaisheshika school of Hinduism and dated to be from the 1st millennium BCE, states 
The "Nyāya Sūtras" by Akshapada variously dated to be from 4th to 2nd century BCE, and belonging to the Nyaya school of Hinduism, in chapter 4.2 discusses the importance of Yoga as follows, 
The "Brahma Sutras" by Badarayana, estimated to have been completed in its surviving form in approx. 400-450 CE, while the original version might be ancient and composed between 500 BCE and 200 BCE, belonging to the Vedanta school of Hinduism, in chapter 2 assumes the existence of a text called Yoga Smriti.
Scholars contest whether this text was a precursor or the same as Patanjali's Yogasutra, but either premise is uncertain.
The verses of Brahma Sutras assert that dualism of the prevailing Yoga philosophy is refuted, as the value of Yoga is as a means to realization of the Self, not in propositions about Self that is in conflict with the Vedic texts.
Radhakrishnan translates the text as follows, 
The "Yoga Vasistha" is a syncretic text on Yoga philosophy, variously dated to be from 6th- to 14th-century CE.
It is structured as a dialogue between sage Vasistha of the Vedic era and the philosopher-king Rama of the Hindu epic "Ramayana".
The text synthesizes elements of Vedanta, Jainism, Yoga, Samkhya, Saiva Siddhanta and Mahayana Buddhism.
Among other things, the text discusses Yoga philosophy in its various chapters.
In section 6.1, "Yoga Vasistha" introduces Yoga as follows, 
Meditation 
Meditation is a practice in which an individual uses a technique – such as mindfulness, or focusing the mind on a particular object, thought, or activity – to train attention and awareness, and achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state.
Meditation is practiced in numerous religious traditions.
The earliest records of meditation ("dhyana") are found in the Upanishads, and meditation plays a salient role in the contemplative repertoire of Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism.
Since the 19th century, Asian meditative techniques have spread to other cultures where they have also found application in non-spiritual contexts, such as business and health.
Meditation may significantly reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and pain, and enhance peace, perception, self-concept, and well-being.
Research is ongoing to better understand the effects of meditation on health (psychological, neurological, and cardiovascular) and other areas.
Etymology.
The English "meditation" is derived from Old French "meditacioun", in turn from Latin "meditatio" from a verb "meditari", meaning "to think, contemplate, devise, ponder".
In the Catholic tradition, the use of the term "meditatio" as part of a formal, stepwise process of meditation goes back to at least the 12th century monk Guigo II, before which the Greek word Theoria was used for the same purpose.
Apart from its historical usage, the term "meditation" was introduced as a translation for Eastern spiritual practices, referred to as "dhyāna" in Hinduism and Buddhism and which comes from the Sanskrit root "dhyai", meaning to contemplate or meditate.
The term "meditation" in English may also refer to practices from Islamic Sufism, or other traditions such as Jewish Kabbalah and Christian Hesychasm.
Definitions.
Difficulties in defining meditation.
No universally accepted definition.
Meditation has proven difficult to define as it covers a wide range of dissimilar practices in different traditions.
In popular usage, the word "meditation" and the phrase "meditative practice" are often used imprecisely to designate practices found across many cultures.
These can include almost anything that is claimed to train the attention of mind or to teach calm or compassion.
There remains no definition of necessary and sufficient criteria for meditation that has achieved universal or widespread acceptance within the modern scientific community.
In 1971, Claudio Naranjo noted that "The word 'meditation' has been used to designate a variety of practices that differ enough from one another so that we may find trouble in defining what "meditation" is."
A 2009 study noted a "persistent lack of consensus in the literature" and a "seeming intractability of defining meditation".
Separation of technique from tradition.
Some of the difficulty in precisely defining meditation has been in recognizing the particularities of the many various traditions; and theories and practice can differ within a tradition.
Taylor noted that even within a faith such as "Hindu" or "Buddhist", schools and individual teachers may teach distinct types of meditation.
Ornstein noted that "Most techniques of meditation do not exist as solitary practices but are only artificially separable from an entire system of practice and belief."
For instance, while monks meditate as part of their everyday lives, they also engage the codified rules and live together in monasteries in specific cultural settings that go along with their meditative practices.
Dictionary definitions.
Dictionaries give both the original Latin meaning of "think[ing] deeply about (something)"; as well as the popular usage of "focusing one's mind for a period of time", "the act of giving your attention to only one thing, either as a religious activity or as a way of becoming calm and relaxed", and "to engage in mental exercise (such as concentrating on one's breathing or repetition of a mantra) for the purpose of reaching a heightened level of spiritual awareness."
Scholarly definitions.
In modern psychological research, meditation has been defined and characterized in various ways.
Many of these emphasize the role of attention and characterize the practice of meditation as attempts to get beyond the reflexive, "discursive thinking" or "logic" mind to achieve a deeper, more devout, or more relaxed state.
Bond et al. (2009) identified criteria for defining a practice as meditation "for use in a comprehensive systematic review of the therapeutic use of meditation", using "a 5-round Delphi study with a panel of 7 experts in meditation research" who were also trained in diverse but empirically highly studied (Eastern-derived or clinical) forms of meditation: 
Several other definitions of meditation have been used by influential modern reviews of research on meditation across multiple traditions: 
Classifications.
Focused and open methods.
In the West, meditation techniques have often been classified in two broad categories, which in actual practice are often combined: focused (or concentrative) meditation and open monitoring (or mindfulness) meditation: 
Focused methods include paying attention to the breath, to an idea or feeling (such as mettā (loving-kindness)), to a kōan, or to a mantra (such as in transcendental meditation), and single point meditation.
Open monitoring methods include mindfulness, shikantaza and other awareness states.
Other possible typologies.
Another typology divides meditation approaches into concentrative, generative, receptive and reflective practices: 
The Buddhist tradition often divides meditative practice into samatha, or calm abiding, and vipassana, insight.
Mindfulness of breathing, a form of focused attention, calms down the mind; this calmed mind can then investigate the nature of reality, by monitoring the fleeting and ever-changing constituents of experience, by reflective investigation, or by "turning back the radiance," focusing awareness on awareness itself and discerning the true nature of mind as awareness itself.
Matko and Sedlmeier (2019) "call into question the common division into “focused attention” and “open-monitoring” practices."
They argue for "two orthogonal dimensions along which meditation techniques could be classified," namely "activation" and "amount of body orientation," proposing seven clusters of techniques: "mindful observation, body-centered meditation, visual concentration, contemplation, affect-centered meditation, mantra meditation, and meditation with movement."
Jonathan Shear argues that transcendental meditation is an "automatic self-transcending" technique, different from focused attention and open monitoring.
In this kind of practice, "there is no attempt to sustain any particular condition at all.
Practices of this kind, once started, are reported to automatically “transcend” their own activity and disappear, to be started up again later if appropriate."
Yet, Shear also states that "automatic self-transcending" also applies to the way other techniques such as from Zen and Qigong are practiced by experienced meditators "once they had become effortless and automatic through years of practice."
Technique.
Posture.
Asanas and positions such as the full-lotus, half-lotus, Burmese, Seiza, and kneeling positions are popular in Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism, although other postures such as sitting, supine (lying), and standing are also used.
Meditation is also sometimes done while walking, known as kinhin, while doing a simple task mindfully, known as samu, or while lying down, known as savasana.
Postures involve focus attention and move body coordinately or hold still with rhythmic inhalation and exhalation.
Frequency.
The Transcendental Meditation technique recommends practice of 20 minutes twice per day.
Some techniques suggest less time, especially when starting meditation, and Richard Davidson has quoted research saying benefits can be achieved with a practice of only 8 minutes per day.
Research shows improvement in meditation time with simple oral and video training.
Some meditators practice for much longer, particularly when on a course or retreat.
Some meditators find practice best in the hours before dawn.
Supporting aids.
Use of prayer beads.
Some religions have traditions of using prayer beads as tools in devotional meditation.
Most prayer beads and Christian rosaries consist of pearls or beads linked together by a thread.
The Roman Catholic rosary is a string of beads containing five sets with ten small beads.
The Hindu japa mala has 108 beads (the figure 108 in itself having spiritual significance), as well as those used in Gaudiya Vaishnavism, the Hare Krishna tradition, Jainism and Buddhist prayer beads.
Each bead is counted once as a person recites a mantra until the person has gone all the way around the mala.
The Muslim misbaha has 99 beads.
There is also quite a variance when it comes to materials used for beads.
Beads made from seeds of rudraksha trees are considered sacred by devotees of Shiva, while followers of Vishnu revere the wood that comes from the tulsi plant.
Striking the meditator.
The Buddhist literature has many stories of Enlightenment being attained through disciples being struck by their masters.
According to T. Griffith Foulk, the encouragement stick was an integral part of the Zen practice: 
Using a narrative.
Neuroscientist and long-time meditator Richard Davidson has expressed the view that having a narrative can help the maintenance of daily practice.
For instance he himself prostrates to the teachings, and meditates "not primarily for my benefit, but for the benefit of others".
Meditation traditions.
Origins.
The history of meditation is intimately bound up with the religious context within which it was practiced.
Rossano has suggested that the emergence of the capacity for focused attention, an element of many methods of meditation, may have contributed to the latest phases of human biological evolution.
Some of the earliest references to meditation, as well as proto-Samkhya, are found in the Upanishads of India.
The earliest clear references to meditation are in the middle Upanishads and the Mahabharata (including the Bhagavad Gita).
According to Gavin Flood, the earlier Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is describing meditation when it states that "having become calm and concentrated, one perceives the self ("ātman") within oneself" (BU 4.4.23).
Indian religions.
Jainism.
Jain meditation and spiritual practices system were referred to as salvation-path.
It has three parts called the "Ratnatraya" "Three Jewels": right perception and faith, right knowledge and right conduct.
Meditation in Jainism aims at realizing the self, attaining salvation, and taking the soul to complete freedom.
It aims to reach and to remain in the pure state of soul which is believed to be pure consciousness, beyond any attachment or aversion.
The practitioner strives to be just a knower-seer (Gyata-Drashta).
Jain meditation can be broadly categorized to "Dharma Dhyana" and "Shukla Dhyana".
Jainism uses meditation techniques such as "pindāstha-dhyāna, padāstha-dhyāna, rūpāstha-dhyāna, rūpātita-dhyāna, and savīrya-dhyāna".
In "padāstha dhyāna" one focuses on a mantra.
A mantra could be either a combination of core letters or words on deity or themes.
There is a rich tradition of Mantra in Jainism.
All Jain followers irrespective of their sect, whether Digambara or Svetambara, practice mantra.
Mantra chanting is an important part of daily lives of Jain monks and followers.
Mantra chanting can be done either loudly or silently in mind.
Contemplation is a very old and important meditation technique.
The practitioner meditates deeply on subtle facts.
In "agnya vichāya", one contemplates on seven facts – life and non-life, the inflow, bondage, stoppage and removal of "karmas", and the final accomplishment of liberation.
In "apaya vichāya", one contemplates on the incorrect insights one indulges, which eventually develops right insight.
In "vipaka vichāya", one reflects on the eight causes or basic types of "karma".
In "sansathan vichāya", one thinks about the vastness of the universe and the loneliness of the soul.
Buddhism.
Buddhists pursue meditation as part of the path toward awakening and nirvana.
The closest words for meditation in the classical languages of Buddhism are "bhāvanā" ("development"), and the core practices of body contemplations (repulsiveness and cemetery contemplations) and anapanasati (mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing) culminating in "jhāna"/"dhyāna" or "samādhi".
While most classical and contemporary Buddhist meditation guides are school-specific, the root meditative practices of various body recollections and breath meditation have been preserved and transmitted in almost all Buddhist traditions, through Buddhist texts like the Satipatthana Sutta and the Dhyana sutras, and through oral teacher-student transmissions.
These ancient practices are supplemented with various distinct interpretations of, and developments in, these practices.
The Theravāda tradition stresses the development of samatha and vipassana, postulating over fifty methods for developing mindfulness based on the Satipatthana Sutta, and forty for developing concentration based on the Visuddhimagga.
The Tibetan tradition incorporated Sarvastivada and Tantric practices, wedded with Madhyamaka philosophy, and developed thousands of visualization meditations.
Via the Dhyana sutras, which are based on the Sarvastivada-tradition, the Zen-tradition incorporated mindfulness and breath-meditation.
Downplaying the "petty complexities" of satipatthana and the body-recollections (but maintaining the awareness of immanent death), the early Chan-tradition developed the notions or practices of "wu nian" ("no thought, no "fixation on thought, such as one's own views, experiences, and knowledge") and "fēi sīliàng" (非思量, Japanese: "hishiryō", "nonthinking"); and "kanxin" ("observing the mind") and "shou-i pu i" (守一不移, "maintaining the one without wavering," turning the attention from the objects of experience, to the nature of mind, the perceiving subject itself, which is equated with Buddha-nature.
The Silk Road transmission of Buddhism introduced meditation to other Asian countries, reaching China in the 2nd century CE, and Japan in the 6th century CE.
In the modern era, Buddhist meditation techniques have become popular in the wider world, due to the influence of Buddhist modernism on Asian Buddhism, and western lay interest in Zen and the Vipassana movement, with many non-Buddhists taking-up meditative practices.
The modernized concept of mindfulness (based on the Buddhist term "sati") and related meditative practices have in turn led to mindfulness based therapies.
Dhyana.
Dhyana may have been an original contribution of Gautama Buddha (5th cent.
BCE), the founder of Buddhism.
While often presented as a form of focused attention or concentration, as in Buddhagosa's Theravada classic the Visuddhimagga ("Path of purification, 5th c. CE), according to a number contemporary scholars and scholar-practitioners, it is actually a description of the development of perfected equanimity and mindfulness, apparently induced by satipatthana, an open monitoring of the breath, without trying to regulate it.
The same description, in a different formula, can be found in the bojjhanga, the "seven factors of awakening," and may therefore refer to the core program of early Buddhist "bhavana".
According to Vetter, dhyana seems to be a natural development from the sense-restraint and moral constrictions prescribed by the Buddhist tradition.
Samatha and vipassana.
The Buddha identified two paramount mental qualities that arise from wholesome meditative practice or "bhavana", namely "samatha" ("calm," "serenity" "tranquility") and "vipassana" (insight).
As the developing tradition started to emphasize the value of liberating insight, and "dhyana" came to be understood as concentration, "samatha" and "vipassana" were understood as two distinct meditative techniques.
In this understanding, "samatha" steadies, composes, unifies and concentrates the mind, while "vipassana" enables one to see, explore and discern "formations" (conditioned phenomena based on the five aggregates).
According to this understanding, which is central to Theravada orthodoxy but also plays a role in Tibetan Buddhism, through the meditative development of serenity, one is able to weaken the obscuring hindrances and bring the mind to a collected, pliant, and still state (samadhi).
This quality of mind then supports the development of insight and wisdom (Prajñā) which is the quality of mind that can "clearly see" ("vi-passana") the nature of phenomena.
What exactly is to be seen varies within the Buddhist traditions.
In Theravada, all phenomena are to be seen as impermanent, suffering, not-self and empty.
When this happens, one develops dispassion ("viraga") for all phenomena, including all negative qualities and hindrances and lets them go.
It is through the release of the hindrances and ending of craving through the meditative development of insight that one gains liberation.
Hinduism.
There are many schools and styles of meditation within Hinduism.
In pre-modern and traditional Hinduism, "Yoga" and "Dhyana" are practised to recognize 'pure awareness', or 'pure consciousness', undisturbed by the workings of the mind, as one's eternal self.
In Advaita Vedanta "jivatman", individual self, is recognized as illusory, and in Reality identical with the omnipresent and non-dual Ātman-Brahman.
In the dualistic Yoga school and Samkhya, the Self is called Purusha, a pure consciousness undisturbed by Prakriti, 'nature'.
Depending on the tradition, the liberative event is named moksha, vimukti or kaivalya.
One of the most influential texts of classical Hindu Yoga is Patañjali's Yoga sutras (c. 400 CE), a text associated with Yoga and Samkhya, which outlines eight limbs leading to kaivalya ("aloneness").
These are ethical discipline (yamas), rules (niyamas), physical postures (āsanas), breath control (prāṇāyama), withdrawal from the senses (pratyāhāra), one-pointedness of mind (dhāraṇā), meditation (dhyāna), and finally samādhi.
Later developments in Hindu meditation include the compilation of Hatha Yoga (forceful yoga) compendiums like the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, the development of Bhakti yoga as a major form of meditation, and Tantra.
Another important Hindu yoga text is the Yoga Yajnavalkya, which makes use of Hatha Yoga and Vedanta Philosophy.
Sikhism.
In Sikhism, simran (meditation) and good deeds are both necessary to achieve the devotee's Spiritual goals; without good deeds meditation is futile.
When Sikhs meditate, they aim to feel God's presence and emerge in the divine light.
It is only God's divine will or order that allows a devotee to desire to begin to meditate.
Nām Japnā involves focusing one's attention on the names or great attributes of God.
Taoism.
Taoist meditation has developed techniques including concentration, visualization, "qi" cultivation, contemplation, and mindfulness meditations in its long history.
Traditional Daoist meditative practices were influenced by Chinese Buddhism from around the 5th century and influenced Traditional Chinese medicine and the Chinese martial arts.
Livia Kohn distinguishes three basic types of Taoist meditation: "concentrative", "insight", and "visualization".
"Ding" 定 (literally means "decide; settle; stabilize") refers to "deep concentration", "intent contemplation", or "perfect absorption".
"Guan" 觀 (lit. "watch; observe; view") meditation seeks to merge and attain unity with the Dao.
It was developed by Tang Dynasty (618–907) Taoist masters based upon the "Tiantai" Buddhist practice of "Vipassanā" "insight" or "wisdom" meditation.
"Cun" 存 (lit. "exist; be present; survive") has a sense of "to cause to exist; to make present" in the meditation techniques popularized by the Taoist Shangqing and Lingbao Schools.
A meditator visualizes or actualizes solar and lunar essences, lights, and deities within their body, which supposedly results in health and longevity, even "xian" 仙/仚/僊, "immortality".
The (late 4th century BCE) "Guanzi" essay "Neiye" "Inward training" is the oldest received writing on the subject of "qi" cultivation and breath-control meditation techniques.
For instance, "When you enlarge your mind and let go of it, when you relax your vital breath and expand it, when your body is calm and unmoving: And you can maintain the One and discard the myriad disturbances. ...
This is called "revolving the vital breath": Your thoughts and deeds seem heavenly."
The (c. 3rd century BCE) Taoist "Zhuangzi" records "zuowang" or "sitting forgetting" meditation.
Confucius asked his disciple Yan Hui to explain what "sit and forget" means: "I slough off my limbs and trunk, dim my intelligence, depart from my form, leave knowledge behind, and become identical with the Transformational Thoroughfare."
Taoist meditation practices are central to Chinese martial arts (and some Japanese martial arts), especially the "qi"-related "neijia" "internal martial arts".
Some well-known examples are "daoyin" "guiding and pulling", "qigong" "life-energy exercises", "neigong" "internal exercises", "neidan" "internal alchemy", and "taijiquan" "great ultimate boxing", which is thought of as moving meditation.
One common explanation contrasts "movement in stillness" referring to energetic visualization of "qi" circulation in "qigong" and "zuochan" "seated meditation", versus "stillness in movement" referring to a state of meditative calm in "taijiquan" forms.
Also the unification or middle road forms such as Wuxingheqidao that seeks the unification of internal alchemical forms with more external forms.
Monotheistic religions.
Judaism.
Judaism has made use of meditative practices for thousands of years.
For instance, in the Torah, the patriarch Isaac is described as going "לשוח" ("lasuach") in the field – a term understood by all commentators as some type of meditative practice (Genesis 24:63).
Similarly, there are indications throughout the Tanakh (the Hebrew Bible) that the prophets meditated.
In the Old Testament, there are two Hebrew words for meditation: "hāgâ" (), "to sigh" or "murmur", but also "to meditate", and "sîḥâ" (), "to muse", or "rehearse in one's mind".
Classical Jewish texts espouse a wide range of meditative practices, often associated with the cultivation of "kavanah" or intention.
The first layer of rabbinic law, the Mishnah, describes ancient sages "waiting" for an hour before their prayers, "in order to direct their hearts to the Omnipresent One (Mishnah Berakhot 5:1).
Other early rabbinic texts include instructions for visualizing the Divine Presence (B. Talmud Sanhedrin 22a) and breathing with conscious gratitude for every breath (Genesis Rabba 14:9).
One of the best-known types of meditation in early Jewish mysticism was the work of the Merkabah, from the root /R-K-B/ meaning "chariot" (of God).
Some meditative traditions have been encouraged in Kabbalah, and some Jews have described Kabbalah as an inherently meditative field of study.
Kabbalistic meditation often involves the mental visualization of the supernal realms.
Aryeh Kaplan has argued that the ultimate purpose of Kabbalistic meditation is to understand and cleave to the Divine.
Meditation has been of interest to a wide variety of modern Jews.
In modern Jewish practice, one of the best known meditative practices is called "hitbodedut" ("התבודדות", alternatively transliterated as "hisbodedus"), and is explained in Kabbalistic, Hasidic, and Mussar writings, especially the Hasidic method of Rabbi Nachman of Breslav.
The word derives from the Hebrew word "boded" (בודד), meaning the state of being alone.
Another Hasidic system is the Habad method of "hisbonenus", related to the Sephirah of "Binah", Hebrew for understanding.
This practice is the analytical reflective process of making oneself understand a mystical concept well, that follows and internalises its study in Hasidic writings.
The Musar Movement, founded by Rabbi Israel Salanter in the middle of the nineteenth-century, emphasized meditative practices of introspection and visualization that could help to improve moral character.
Conservative rabbi Alan Lew has emphasized meditation playing an important role in the process of "teshuvah" (repentance).
Jewish Buddhists have adopted Buddhist styles of meditation.
Christianity.
Christian meditation is a term for a form of prayer in which a structured attempt is made to get in touch with and deliberately reflect upon the revelations of God.
In the Roman Empire, by 20 BCE Philo of Alexandria had written on some form of "spiritual exercises" involving attention (prosoche) and concentration and by the 3rd century Plotinus had developed meditative techniques.
The word meditation comes from the Latin word "meditatum", which means to "concentrate" or "to ponder".
Monk Guigo II introduced this terminology for the first time in the 12th century AD.
Christian meditation is the process of deliberately focusing on specific thoughts (e.g. a biblical scene involving Jesus and the Virgin Mary) and reflecting on their meaning in the context of the love of God.
Christian meditation is sometimes taken to mean the middle level in a broad three-stage characterization of prayer: it then involves more reflection than first level vocal prayer, but is more structured than the multiple layers of contemplation in Christianity.
Between the 10th and 14th centuries, hesychasm was developed, particularly on Mount Athos in Greece, and involves the repetition of the Jesus prayer.
Interactions with Indians or the Sufis may have influenced the Eastern Christian meditation approach to hesychasm, but this is unproven.
Western Christian meditation contrasts with most other approaches in that it does not involve the repetition of any phrase or action and requires no specific posture.
Western Christian meditation progressed from the 6th century practice of Bible reading among Benedictine monks called Lectio Divina, i.e. divine reading.
Its four formal steps as a "ladder" were defined by the monk Guigo II in the 12th century with the Latin terms "lectio", "meditatio", "oratio", and "contemplatio" (i.e. read, ponder, pray, contemplate).
Western Christian meditation was further developed by saints such as Ignatius of Loyola and Teresa of Avila in the 16th century.
On April 28, 2021, Pope Francis, in an address to the General Audience, said that meditation is a need for everyone.
He noted that the term "meditation" has had many meanings throughout history, and that "the ancients used to say that the organ of prayer is the heart."
In Catholic Christianity, the Rosary is a devotion for the meditation of the mysteries of Jesus and Mary.
“The gentle repetition of its prayers makes it an excellent means to moving into deeper meditation.
It gives us an opportunity to open ourselves to God’s word, to refine our interior gaze by turning our minds to the life of Christ.
The first principle is that meditation is learned through practice.
Many people who practice rosary meditation begin very simply and gradually develop a more sophisticated meditation.
The meditator learns to hear an interior voice, the voice of God.
Similarly, the chotki of the Eastern Orthodox denomination, the Wreath of Christ of the Lutheran faith, and the Anglican prayer beads of the Episcopalian tradition are used for Christian prayer and meditation.
According to Edmund P. Clowney, Christian meditation contrasts with Eastern forms of meditation as radically as the portrayal of God the Father in the Bible contrasts with depictions of Krishna or Brahman in Indian teachings.
Unlike some Eastern styles, most styles of Christian meditation do not rely on the repeated use of mantras, and yet are also intended to stimulate thought and deepen meaning.
Christian meditation aims to heighten the personal relationship based on the love of God that marks Christian communion.
In "Aspects of Christian meditation", the Catholic Church warned of potential incompatibilities in mixing Christian and Eastern styles of meditation.
In 2003, in "A Christian reflection on the New Age" the Vatican announced that the "Church avoids any concept that is close to those of the New Age".
Islam.
Dhikr is a type of meditation within Islam, meaning remembering and mentioning God, which involves the repetition of the 99 Names of God since the 8th or 9th century.
It is interpreted in different meditative techniques in Sufism or Islamic mysticism.
This became one of the essential elements of Sufism as it was systematized traditionally.
It is juxtaposed with "fikr" (thinking) which leads to knowledge.
By the 12th century, the practice of Sufism included specific meditative techniques, and its followers practiced breathing controls and the repetition of holy words.
Sufism uses a meditative procedure like Buddhist concentration, involving high-intensity and sharply focused introspection.
In the Oveyssi-Shahmaghsoudi Sufi order, for example, muraqabah takes the form of tamarkoz, "concentration" in Persian.
"Tafakkur" or "tadabbur" in Sufism literally means "reflection upon the universe": this is considered to permit access to a form of cognitive and emotional development that can emanate only from the higher level, i.e. from God.
The sensation of receiving divine inspiration awakens and liberates both heart and intellect, permitting such inner growth that the apparently mundane actually takes on the quality of the infinite.
Muslim teachings embrace life as a test of one's submission to God.
Dervishes of certain Sufi orders practice whirling, a form of physically active meditation.
Baháʼí Faith.
In the teachings of the Baháʼí Faith, meditation is a primary tool for spiritual development, involving reflection on the words of God.
While prayer and meditation are linked, where meditation happens generally in a prayerful attitude, prayer is seen specifically as turning toward God, and meditation is seen as a communion with one's self where one focuses on the divine.
In Baháʼí teachings the purpose of meditation is to strengthen one's understanding of the words of God, and to make one's soul more susceptible to their potentially transformative power, more receptive to the need for both prayer and meditation to bring about and maintain a spiritual communion with God.
Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the religion, never specified any particular form of meditation, and thus each person is free to choose their own form.
However, he did state that Baháʼís should read a passage of the Baháʼí writings twice a day, once in the morning, and once in the evening, and meditate on it.
He also encouraged people to reflect on one's actions and worth at the end of each day.
During the Nineteen Day Fast, a period of the year during which Baháʼís adhere to a sunrise-to-sunset fast, they meditate and pray to reinvigorate their spiritual forces.
Modern spirituality.
Modern dissemination in the West.
Meditation has spread in the West since the late 19th century, accompanying increased travel and communication among cultures worldwide.
Most prominent has been the transmission of Asian-derived practices to the West.
In addition, interest in some Western-based meditative practices has been revived, and these have been disseminated to a limited extent to Asian countries.
Ideas about Eastern meditation had begun "seeping into American popular culture even before the American Revolution through the various sects of European occult Christianity", and such ideas "came pouring in [to America] during the era of the transcendentalists, especially between the 1840s and the 1880s."
The following decades saw further spread of these ideas to America: 
More recently, in the 1960s, another surge in Western interest in meditative practices began.
The rise of communist political power in Asia led to many Asian spiritual teachers taking refuge in Western countries, oftentimes as refugees.
In addition to spiritual forms of meditation, secular forms of meditation have taken root.
Rather than focusing on spiritual growth, secular meditation emphasizes stress reduction, relaxation and self-improvement.
The 2012 US National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) (34,525 subjects) found 8% of US adults used meditation, with lifetime and 12-month prevalence of meditation use of 5.2% and 4.1% respectively.
In the 2017 NHIS survey, meditation use among workers was 10% (up from 8% in 2002).
Mantra meditation, with the use of a japa mala and especially with focus on the Hare Krishna maha-mantra, is a central practice of the Gaudiya Vaishnava faith tradition and the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), also known as the Hare Krishna movement.
Other popular New Religious Movements include the Ramakrishna Mission, Vedanta Society, Divine Light Mission, Chinmaya Mission, Osho, Sahaja Yoga, Transcendental Meditation, Oneness University, Brahma Kumaris, Vihangam Yoga and Heartfulness Meditation (Sahaj Marg).
New Age.
New Age meditations are often influenced by Eastern philosophy, mysticism, yoga, Hinduism and Buddhism, yet may contain some degree of Western influence.
In the West, meditation found its mainstream roots through the social revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, when many of the youth of the day rebelled against traditional religion as a reaction against what some perceived as the failure of Christianity to provide spiritual and ethical guidance.
New Age meditation as practised by the early hippies is regarded for its techniques of blanking out the mind and releasing oneself from conscious thinking.
This is often aided by repetitive chanting of a mantra, or focusing on an object.
New Age meditation evolved into a range of purposes and practices, from serenity and balance to access to other realms of consciousness to the concentration of energy in group meditation to the supreme goal of samadhi, as in the ancient yogic practice of meditation.
Guided meditation.
Guided meditation is a form of meditation which uses a number of different techniques to achieve or enhance the meditative state.
It may simply be meditation done under the guidance of a trained practitioner or teacher, or it may be through the use of imagery, music, and other techniques.
The session can be either in person, via media comprising music or verbal instruction, or a combination of both.
The most common form is a combination of meditation music and receptive music therapy, guided imagery, relaxation, mindfulness, and journaling.
Because of the different combinations used under the one term, it can be difficult to attribute positive or negative outcomes to any of the various techniques.
Furthermore, the term is frequently used interchangeably with "guided imagery" and sometimes with "creative visualization" in popular psychology and self-help literature.
It is less commonly used in scholarly and scientific publications.
Consequently, guided meditation cannot be understood as a single technique but rather multiple techniques that are integral to its practice.
Guided meditation as an aggregate or synthesis of techniques includes meditation music, receptive music therapy, guided imagery, relaxation, meditative praxis, and self-reflective diary-keeping or journaling.
All of which have been shown to have therapeutic benefits when employed as an adjunct to primary strategies.
Benefits include lower levels of stress, reducing asthmatic episodes, physical pain, insomnia, episodic anger, negative or irrational thinking,  
and anxiety, as well as improving coping skills, focus,  
and a general feeling of well-being.
Secular applications.
Psychotherapy.
Carl Jung (1875–1961) was an early western explorer of eastern religious practices.
He clearly advocated ways to increase the conscious awareness of an individual.
Yet he expressed some caution concerning a westerner's direct immersion in eastern practices without some prior appreciation of the differing spiritual and cultural contexts.
Also Erich Fromm (1900–1980) later explored spiritual practices of the east.
Clinical applications.
The US National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health states that "Meditation is a mind and body practice that has a long history of use for increasing calmness and physical relaxation, improving psychological balance, coping with illness, and enhancing overall health and well-being."
A 2014 review found that practice of mindfulness meditation for two to six months by people undergoing long-term psychiatric or medical therapy could produce small improvements in anxiety, pain, or depression.
In 2017, the American Heart Association issued a scientific statement that meditation may be a reasonable adjunct practice to help reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, with the qualification that meditation needs to be better defined in higher-quality clinical research of these disorders.
Recent findings have also found evidence of meditation affecting migraines in adults.
Mindfulness meditation may allow for a decrease in migraine episodes, and a drop in migraine medication usage.
Low-quality evidence indicates that meditation may help with irritable bowel syndrome, insomnia, cognitive decline in the elderly, and post-traumatic stress disorder.
Researchers have found that participating in mindfulness meditation can aid insomnia patients by improving sleep quality and total wake time.
Mindfulness meditation is not a treatment for insomnia patients, but it can provide support in addition to their treatment options.
Meditation in the workplace.
A 2010 review of the literature on spirituality and performance in organizations found an increase in corporate meditation programs.
As of 2016 around a quarter of U.S. employers were using stress reduction initiatives.
The goal was to help reduce stress and improve reactions to stress.
Aetna now offers its program to its customers.
Google also implements mindfulness, offering more than a dozen meditation courses, with the most prominent one, "Search Inside Yourself", having been implemented since 2007.
General Mills offers the Mindful Leadership Program Series, a course which uses a combination of mindfulness meditation, yoga and dialogue with the intention of developing the mind's capacity to pay attention.
Relaxation response and biofeedback.
Herbert Benson of Harvard Medical School conducted a series of clinical tests on meditators from various disciplines, including the Transcendental Meditation technique and Tibetan Buddhism.
In 1975, Benson published a book titled "The Relaxation Response" where he outlined his own version of meditation for relaxation.
Also in the 1970s, the American psychologist Patricia Carrington developed a similar technique called Clinically Standardized Meditation (CSM).
In Norway, another sound-based method called Acem Meditation developed a psychology of meditation and has been the subject of several scientific studies.
Biofeedback has been used by many researchers since the 1950s in an effort to enter deeper states of mind.
Effects.
Research on the processes and effects of meditation is a subfield of neurological research.
Modern scientific techniques, such as fMRI and EEG, were used to observe neurological responses during meditation.
Concerns have been raised on the quality of meditation research, including the particular characteristics of individuals who tend to participate.
Meditation lowers heart rate, oxygen consumption, breathing frequency, stress hormones, lactate levels, and sympathetic nervous system activity (associated with the fight-or-flight response), along with a modest decline in blood pressure.
However, those who have meditated for two or three years were found to already have low blood pressure.
During meditation, the oxygen consumption decrease averages 10 to 20 percent over the first three minutes.
During sleep for example, oxygen consumption decreases around 8 percent over four or five hours.
For meditators who have practiced for years, breath rate can drop to three or four breaths per minute and brain waves slow from alpha waves seen in normal relaxation to much slower delta and theta waves.
Since the 1970s, clinical psychology and psychiatry have developed meditation techniques for numerous psychological conditions.
Mindfulness practice is employed in psychology to alleviate mental and physical conditions, such as reducing depression, stress, and anxiety.
Mindfulness is also used in the treatment of drug addiction, although the quality of research has been poor.
Studies demonstrate that meditation has a moderate effect to reduce pain.
There is insufficient evidence for any effect of meditation on positive mood, attention, eating habits, sleep, or body weight.
A 2015 study, including subjective and objective reports and brain scans, has shown that meditation can improve controlling attention, as well as self-awareness.
A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of meditation on empathy, compassion, and prosocial behaviors found that meditation practices had small to medium effects on self-reported and observable outcomes, concluding that such practices can "improve positive prosocial emotions and behaviors".
However, a meta-review published on "Scientific Reports" showed that the evidence is very weak and "that the effects of meditation on compassion were only significant when compared to passive control groups suggests that other forms of active interventions (like watching a nature video) might produce similar outcomes to meditation".
Potential adverse effects.
Meditation has been correlated with unpleasant experiences in some people.
In some cases, it has also been linked to psychosis in a few individuals.
In one study, published in 2019, of 1,232 regular meditators with at least two months of meditation experience, about a quarter reported having had particularly unpleasant meditation-related experiences (such as anxiety, fear, distorted emotions or thoughts, altered sense of self or the world), which they thought may have been caused by their meditation practice.
Meditators with high levels of repetitive negative thinking and those who only engage in deconstructive meditation were more likely to report unpleasant side effects.
Adverse effects were less frequently reported in women and religious meditators.
Difficult experiences encountered in meditation are mentioned in traditional sources; and some may be considered to be just an expected part of the process: for example: seven stages of purification mentioned in Theravāda Buddhism, or possible “unwholesome or frightening visions” mentioned in a practical manual on vipassanā meditation.
Yoga as exercise 
Yoga as exercise is a physical activity consisting mainly of postures, often connected by flowing sequences, sometimes accompanied by breathing exercises, and frequently ending with relaxation lying down or meditation.
Yoga in this form has become familiar across the world, especially in America and Europe.
It is derived from medieval Haṭha yoga, which made use of similar postures, but it is generally simply called "yoga".
Academics have given yoga as exercise a variety of names, including modern postural yoga and transnational anglophone yoga.
Posture is described in the "Yoga Sutras" II.29 as the third of the eight limbs, the ashtanga, of yoga.
Sutra II.46 defines it as that which is "steady and comfortable", but no further elaboration or list of postures is given.
Postures were not central in any of the older traditions of yoga; posture practice was revived in the 1920s by yoga gurus including Yogendra and Kuvalayananda, who emphasised its health benefits.
The flowing sequences of Surya Namaskar (Salute to the Sun) were pioneered by the Rajah of Aundh, Bhawanrao Shrinivasrao Pant Pratinidhi, in the 1920s.
It and many standing poses used in gymnastics were incorporated into yoga by the yoga teacher Krishnamacharya in Mysore from the 1930s to the 1950s.
Several of his students went on to found influential schools of yoga: Pattabhi Jois created Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga, which in turn led to Power Yoga; B. K. S. Iyengar created Iyengar Yoga, and defined a modern set of yoga postures in his 1966 book "Light on Yoga"; and Indra Devi taught yoga as exercise to many celebrities in Hollywood.
Other major schools founded in the 20th century include Bikram Yoga and Sivananda Yoga.
Yoga as exercise spread across America and Europe, and then the rest of the world.
Haṭha yoga's non-postural practices such as its purifications are much reduced or absent in yoga as exercise.
The term "hatha yoga" is also in use with a different meaning, a gentle unbranded yoga practice, independent of the major schools, often mainly for women.
Practices vary from wholly secular, for exercise and relaxation, through to undoubtedly spiritual, whether in traditions like Sivananda Yoga or in personal rituals.
Yoga as exercise's relationship to Hinduism is complex and contested; some Christians have rejected it on the grounds that it is covertly Hindu, while the "Take Back Yoga" campaign insisted that it was necessarily connected to Hinduism.
Scholars have identified multiple trends in the changing nature of yoga since the end of the 19th century.
Yoga as exercise has developed into a worldwide multi-billion dollar business, involving classes, certification of teachers, clothing such as yoga pants, books, videos, equipment including yoga mats, and holidays.
History.
Yoga's origins.
The Sanskrit noun योग ', cognate with English "yoke", is derived from the root ' "to attach, join, harness, yoke".
Its ancient spiritual and philosophical goal was to unite the human spirit with the divine.
The branch of yoga that makes use of physical postures is Haṭha yoga.
The Sanskrit word हठ "haṭha" means "force", alluding to its use of physical techniques.
Haṭha yoga.
Haṭha yoga flourished among secretive ascetic groups such as Nath yogins in South Asia from c. 1100-c. 1900.
Instruction was directly from guru to individual pupil, in a long-term relationship.
It was associated with religions, especially Hinduism but also Jainism and Buddhism.
Its objectives were to manipulate vital fluids to enable absorption and ultimately liberation.
It consisted of practices including purifications, postures (asanas), locks, the directed gaze, seals, and rhythmic breathing.
These were claimed to provide supernatural powers including healing, destruction of poisons, invisibility, and shape-shifting.
Yogins wore little or no clothing; their bodies were sometimes smeared with cremation ash as a reminder of their forthcoming deaths.
Equipment, too, was scanty; sometimes yogins used a tiger or deer skin as a rug to meditate on.
Hatha yoga made use of a small number of asanas, mainly seated; in particular, there were very few standing poses before 1900.
They were practised slowly, often holding a position for long periods.
The practice of asanas was a minor preparatory aspect of spiritual work.
Yogins followed a strict vegetarian diet, excluding stimulants such as tea, coffee or alcohol.
Their yoga was taught without payment; gurus were supported by gifts and the philosophy was anti-consumerist.
Early influences.
According to one theory, the system of physical education practised in the 19th-century Young Men's Christian Association, adapted by ex-military gymnasts for the schooling system in colonial British India, became the default form of mass-drill, and this influenced the "modernized hatha yoga".
According to the yoga scholar Suzanne Newcombe, modern yoga in India is a blend of Western gymnastics with postures from Haṭha yoga in India in the 20th century.
From the 1850s onwards, there developed in India a culture of physical exercise to counter the colonial stereotype of supposed "degeneracy" of Indians compared to the British, a belief reinforced by then-current ideas of Lamarckism and eugenics.
This culture was taken up from the 1880s to the early 20th century by Indian nationalists such as Tiruka, who taught exercises and unarmed combat techniques under the guise of yoga.
The German bodybuilder Eugen Sandow was acclaimed on his 1905 visit to India, at which time he was already a "cultural hero" in the country.
The anthropologist Joseph Alter suggests that Sandow was the person who had the most influence on modern yoga.
The first handbook of asanas in English, and the first to be illustrated with photographs, was Seetharaman Sundaram's 1928 "Yogic Physical Culture".
Introduction to the West.
Yoga was introduced to the Western world by the spiritual leader Vivekananda's 1893 visit to the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago, and his 1896 book "Raja Yoga".
However, he rejected Haṭha yoga and its "entirely" physical practices such as asanas as difficult and ineffective for spiritual growth, out of a widely shared distaste for India's wandering yogins.
Yoga asanas were brought to America by the yoga teacher Yogendra.
He founded a branch of The Yoga Institute in New York state in 1919, starting to make Haṭha yoga acceptable, seeking scientific evidence for its health benefits, and writing books such as his 1928 "Yoga Asanas Simplified" and his 1931 "Yoga Personal Hygiene".
The flowing sequences of salute to the sun, Surya Namaskar, now accepted as yoga and containing popular asanas such as Uttanasana and upward and downward dog poses, were popularized by the Rajah of Aundh, Bhawanrao Shrinivasrao Pant Pratinidhi, in the 1920s.
In 1924, the yoga teacher Kuvalayananda founded the Kaivalyadhama Health and Yoga Research Center in Maharashtra, combining asanas with gymnastics, and like Yogendra seeking a scientific and medical basis for yogic practices.
In 1925, Kuvalayananda's rival Paramahansa Yogananda, having moved from India to America, set up the Self-Realization Fellowship in Los Angeles, and taught yoga, including asanas, breathing, chanting and meditation, to "tens of thousands of Americans".
In 1923, Yogananda's younger brother, Bishnu Charan Ghosh, founded the Ghosh College of Yoga and Physical Culture in Calcutta.
Tirumalai Krishnamacharya (1888–1989), "the father of modern yoga", claimed to have spent seven years with one of the few masters of Haṭha yoga then living, Ramamohana Brahmachari, at Lake Manasarovar in Tibet, from 1912 to 1918.
He studied under Kuvalayananda in the 1930s, and then in his yogashala in the Jaganmohan Palace in Mysore created "a marriage of Haṭha yoga, wrestling exercises, and modern Western gymnastic movement, and unlike anything seen before in the yoga tradition."
The Maharajah of Mysore Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV was a leading advocate of physical culture in India, and a neighbouring hall of his palace was used to teach Surya Namaskar classes, then considered to be gymnastic exercises.
Krishnamacharya adapted these sequences of exercises into his flowing vinyasa style of yoga.
The yoga scholar Mark Singleton noted that gymnastic systems like Niels Bukh's were popular in physical culture in India at that time, and that they contained many postures similar to Krishnamacharya's new asanas.
Among Krishnamacharya's pupils were people who became influential yoga teachers themselves: the Russian Eugenie V. Peterson, known as Indra Devi (from 1937), who moved to Hollywood, taught yoga to celebrities, and wrote the bestselling book "Forever Young, Forever Healthy"; Pattabhi Jois (from 1927), who founded the flowing style Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga whose Mysore style makes use of repetitions of Surya Namaskar, in 1948, which in turn led to Power Yoga; and B.K.S. Iyengar (from 1933), his brother-in-law, who founded Iyengar Yoga, with its first centre in Britain.
Together they made yoga popular as exercise and brought it to the Western world.
Iyengar's 1966 book "Light on Yoga" popularised yoga asanas worldwide with what the scholar-practitioner Norman Sjoman calls its "clear no-nonsense descriptions and the obvious refinement of the illustrations", though the degree of precision it calls for is missing from earlier yoga texts.
Other Indian schools of yoga took up the new style of asanas, but continued to emphasize Haṭha yoga's spiritual goals and practices to varying extents.
The Divine Life Society was founded by Sivananda Saraswati of Rishikesh in 1936.
His many disciples include Swami Vishnudevananda, who founded the International Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centres, starting in 1959; Swami Satyananda of the Bihar School of Yoga, a major centre of Haṭha yoga teacher training, founded in 1963; and Swami Satchidananda of Integral Yoga, founded in 1966.
Vishnudevananda published his "Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga" in 1960, with a list of asanas that substantially overlaps with Iyengar's, sometimes with different names for the same poses; Jois's asana names almost exactly match Iyengar's.
Worldwide commodity.
Three changes around the 1960s allowed yoga as exercise to become a worldwide commodity.
People were for the first time able to travel freely around the world: consumers could go to the east; Indians could migrate to Europe and America; and business people and religious leaders could go where they liked to sell their wares.
Secondly, people across the Western world became disillusioned with organised religion, and started to look for alternatives.
And thirdly, yoga became an uncontroversial form of exercise suitable for mass consumption, unlike the more religious or meditational forms of modern yoga such as Siddha Yoga or Transcendental Meditation.
This involved the dropping of many traditional requirements on the practice of yoga, such as giving alms, being celibate, studying the Hindu scriptures, and retreating from society.
From the 1970s, yoga as exercise spread across many countries of the world, changing as it did so, and becoming "an integral part of (primarily) urban cultures worldwide", to the extent that the word "yoga" in the Western world now means the practice of asanas, typically in a class.
For example, Iyengar Yoga reached South Africa in 1979 with the opening of its institute at Pietermaritzburg; its Association of South East &amp; East Asia was founded in 2009.
Yoga's spread in America was assisted by the television show "Lilias, Yoga and You", hosted by Lilias Folan; it ran from 1970 to 1999.
In Australia, by 2005 some 12% of the population practised yoga in a class or at home.
As a valuable business, yoga has in turn been used in advertising, sometimes for yoga-related products, sometimes for other goods and services.
The market for yoga grew, argues the scholar of religion Andrea Jain, with the creation of an "endless" variety of second-generation yoga brands, saleable products, "constructed and marketed for immediate consumption", based on earlier developments.
For example, in 1997 John Friend, once a financial analyst, who had intensively studied both the postural Iyengar Yoga and the non-postural Siddha Yoga, founded Anusara Yoga.
Friend likened the choice of his yoga over other brands to choosing "a fine restaurant" over "a fast-food joint"; "The New York Times Magazine" headed its piece on him "The Yoga Mogul", while the historian of yoga Stefanie Syman argued that Friend had "very self-consciously" created his own yoga community.
For example, Friend published his own teacher training manual, held workshops, conferences, and festivals, marketed his own brand of yoga mats and water bottles, and prescribed ethical guidelines.
When Friend did not live up to the brand's high standards, he apologised publicly and took steps to protect the brand, in 2012 stepping back from running it and appointing a CEO.
Jain states that yoga is becoming "part of pop culture around the world".
Alter writes that it illustrates "transnational transmutation and the blurring of consumerism, holistic health, and embodied mysticism—as well as good old-fashioned Orientalism."
Singleton argues that the commodity is the yoga body itself, its "spiritual possibility" signified by the "lucent skin of the yoga model", a beautiful image endlessly sold back to the yoga-practising public "as an irresistible commodity of the holistic, perfectible self".
In 2008, the United States Department of Health and Human Services labelled September as National Yoga Month.
From 2015, at the suggestion of India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, an annual International Day of Yoga has been held on 21 June.
Transformation.
The anthropologist Sarah Strauss contrasts the goal of classical yoga, the isolation of the self or "kaivalya", with the modern goals of good health, reduced stress, and physical flexibility.
Sjoman notes that many of the asanas in Iyengar's "Light on Yoga" can be traced to his teacher, Krishnamacharya, "but not beyond him".
Singleton states that yoga used as exercise is not "the outcome of a direct and unbroken lineage of haṭha yoga", but it would be "going too far to say that modern postural yoga has no relationship to asana practice within the Indian tradition."
The contemporary yoga practice is the result of "radical innovation and experimentation" of its Indian heritage.
Jain writes that equating yoga as exercise with hatha yoga "does not account for the historical sources": asanas "only became prominent in modern yoga in the early twentieth century as a result of the dialogical exchanges between Indian reformers and nationalists and Americans and Europeans interested in health and fitness".
In short, Jain writes, "modern yoga systems ... bear little resemblance to the yoga systems that preceded them.
This is because [both] ... are specific to their own social contexts."
The historian Jared Farmer writes that twelve trends have characterised yoga's progression from the 1890s onwards: from peripheral to central in society; from India to global; from male to "predominantly" female; from spiritual to "mostly" secular; from sectarian to universal; from mendicant to consumerist; from meditational to postural; from being understood intellectually to experientially; from embodying esoteric knowledge to being accessible to all; from being taught orally to hands-on instruction; from presenting poses in text to using photographs; and from being "contorted social pariahs" to "lithe social winners".
The trend away from authority is continued in post-lineage yoga, which is practised outside any major school or guru's lineage.
Practices.
Asanas.
Yoga as exercise consists largely but not exclusively of the practice of asanas.
The numbers of asanas described (not just named) in some major Haṭha yoga and modern texts are shown in the table; all the Haṭha yoga text dates are approximate.
Asanas can be classified in different ways, which may overlap: for example, by the position of the head and feet (standing, sitting, reclining, inverted), by whether balancing is required, or by the effect on the spine (forward bend, backbend, twist), giving a set of asana types agreed by most authors.
The yoga guru Dharma Mittra uses his own categories such as "Floor &amp; Supine Poses".
Yogapedia and "Yoga Journal" add "Hip-opening"; the yoga teacher Darren Rhodes, Yogapedia and "Yoga Journal" also add "Core strength".
Styles.
The number of schools and styles of yoga in the Western world has continued to grow rapidly.
By 2012, there were at least 19 widespread styles from Ashtanga Yoga to Viniyoga.
These emphasise different aspects including aerobic exercise, precision in the asanas, and spirituality in the Haṭha yoga tradition.
These aspects can be illustrated by schools with distinctive styles.
For example, Bikram Yoga has an aerobic exercise style with rooms heated to and a fixed pattern of 2 breathing exercises and 24 asanas.
Iyengar Yoga emphasises correct alignment in the postures, working slowly, if necessary with props, and ending with relaxation.
Sivananda Yoga focuses more on spiritual practice, with 12 basic poses, chanting in Sanskrit, pranayama breathing exercises, meditation, and relaxation in each class, and importance is placed on vegetarian diet.
Jivamukti Yoga uses a flowing vinyasa style of asanas accompanied by music, chanting, and the reading of scriptures.
Kundalini yoga emphasises the awakening of kundalini energy through meditation, pranayama, chanting, and suitable asanas.
Alongside the yoga brands, many teachers, for example in England, offer an unbranded "hatha yoga", often mainly to women, creating their own combinations of poses.
These may be in flowing sequences (vinyasas), and new variants of poses are often created.
The gender imbalance has sometimes been marked; in Britain in the 1970s, women formed between 70 and 90 percent of most yoga classes, as well as most of the yoga teachers.
The tradition begun by Krishnamacharya survives at the Krishnamacharya Yoga Mandiram in Chennai; his son T. K. V. Desikachar and his grandson Kausthub Desikachar continued to teach in small groups, coordinating asana movements with the breath, and personalising the teaching according to the needs of individual students.
Sessions.
Yoga sessions vary widely depending on the school and style, and according to how advanced the class is.
As with any exercise class, sessions usually start slowly with gentle warm-up exercises, move on to more vigorous exercises, and slow down again towards the end.
A beginners' class can begin with simple poses like Sukhasana, some rounds of Surya Namaskar, and then a combination of standing poses such as Trikonasana, sitting poses like Dandasana, and balancing poses like Navasana; it may end with some reclining and inverted poses like Setu Bandha Sarvangasana and Viparita Karani, a reclining twist, and finally Savasana for relaxation and in some styles also for a guided meditation.
A typical session in most styles lasts from an hour to an hour and a half, whereas in Mysore style yoga, the class is scheduled in a three-hour time window during which the students practice on their own at their own speed, following individualised instruction by the teacher.
Hybrids.
The evolution of yoga as exercise is not confined to the creation of new asanas and linking vinyasa sequences.
A wide variety of hybrid activities combining yoga with martial arts, aerial yoga combined with acrobatics, yoga with barre work (as in ballet preparation), on horseback, with dogs, with goats, with ring-tailed lemurs, with weights, and on paddleboards are all being explored.
Purposes.
Exercise.
The energy cost of exercise is measured in units of metabolic equivalent of task (MET).
Less than 3 METs counts as light exercise; 3 to 6 METs is moderate; 6 or over is vigorous.
American College of Sports Medicine and American Heart Association guidelines count periods of at least 10 minutes of moderate MET level activity towards their recommended daily amounts of exercise.
For healthy adults aged 18 to 65, the guidelines recommend moderate exercise for 30 minutes five days a week, or vigorous aerobic exercise for 20 minutes three days a week.
Treated as a form of exercise, a complete yoga session with asanas and pranayama provides 3.3 ± 1.6 METs, on average a moderate workout.
Surya Namaskar ranged from a light 2.9 to a vigorous 7.4 METs; the average for a session of yoga practice without Surya Namaskar was a light 2.9 ± 0.8 METs.
Physical or Hindu.
Since the mid-20th century, yoga has been used, especially in the Western world, as physical exercise for fitness and suppleness, rather than for what the historian of American yoga, Stefanie Syman, calls any "overtly Hindu" purpose.
In 2010, this ambiguity triggered what the "New York Times" called "a surprisingly fierce debate in the gentle world of yoga".
Some saffronising Indian-Americans campaigned to "Take Back Yoga" by informing Americans and other Westerners about the connection between yoga and Hinduism.
The campaign was criticised by the New Age author Deepak Chopra, but supported by the president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, R. Albert Mohler Jr. Jain notes that yoga is not necessarily Hindu, as it can also be Jain or Buddhist; nor is it homogeneous or static, so she is critical of both what she calls the "Christian yogaphobic position" and the "Hindu origins position".
Farmer writes that Syman identifies a Protestant streak in yoga as exercise, "with its emphasis on working the body.
This effortful yoga is, she says, paradoxical, both 'an indulgence and a penance'."
Authorities differ on whether yoga is purely exercise.
For example, in 2012, New York state decided that yoga was exempt from state sales tax as it did not constitute "true exercise", whereas in 2014 the District of Columbia was clear that yoga premises were subject to the local sales tax on premises "the purpose of which is physical exercise".
Similar debates have taken place in a Muslim context; for example, restrictions on yoga have been lifted in Saudi Arabia.
In Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur permits yoga classes provided they do not include chanting or meditation.
The yoga teacher and author Mira Mehta, asked by "Yoga Magazine" in 2010 whether she preferred her pupils to commit to a spiritual path before they start yoga, replied "Certainly not.
A person's spiritual life is his or her own affair.
People come to yoga for all sorts of reasons.
High on the list is health and the desire to become de-stressed."
Kimberley J. Pingatore, studying attitudes among American yoga practitioners, found that they did not view the categories of religious, spiritual, and secular as alternatives.
However, Haṭha yoga's "ecstatic ... transcendent ... possibly subversive" elements remain in yoga used as exercise.The yoga teacher and author Jessamyn Stanley writes that modern Western society "does not respect the esoteric or spiritual at all", making people skeptical about any alignment of yoga as practised in the West with "chakras or spirituality".
Stanley states that it is possible to start a practice without considering such matters, and that styles such as Bikram do not mention them, but that a deepening yoga practice will bring "an overall evolution of the self".
Syman suggests that part of the attraction of Bikram and Ashtanga Yoga was that under the sweat, the commitment, the schedule, the physical demands and even the verbal abuse was a hard-won ecstasy, "a deep feeling of vitality, a feeling of pure energy, an unbowed posture, and mental acuity".
That context has led to a division of opinion among Christians, some like Alexandra Davis of the Evangelical Alliance asserting that it is acceptable as long as they are aware of modern yoga's origins, others like Paul Gosbee stating that yoga's purpose is to "open up chakras" and release kundalini or "serpent power" which in Gosbee's view is "from Satan", making "Christian yoga ... a contradiction".
Church halls are sometimes used for yoga, and in 2015 a yoga group was banned from a church hall in Bristol by the local parochial church council, stating that yoga represented "alternative spiritualities".
In a secular context, the journalists Nell Frizzell and Reni Eddo-Lodge have debated (in "The Guardian") whether Western yoga classes represent "cultural appropriation".
In Frizzell's view, yoga has become a new entity, a long way from the "Yoga Sutras" of Patanjali, and while some practitioners are culturally insensitive, others treat it with more respect.
Eddo-Lodge agrees that Western yoga is far from Patanjali, but argues that the changes cannot be undone, whether people use it "as a holier-than-thou tool, as a tactic to balance out excessive drug use, or practised similarly to its origins with the spirituality that comes with it".
Jain argues however that charges of appropriation "from 'the East' to 'the West'" fail to take account of the fact that yoga is evolving in a shared multinational process; it is not something that is being stolen from one place by another.
Health.
Yoga as exercise has been popularized in the Western world by claims about its health benefits.
The history of such claims was reviewed by William J. Broad in his 2012 book "The Science of Yoga"; he states that the claims that yoga was scientific began as Hindu nationalist posturing.
Among the early exponents was Kuvalayananda, who attempted to demonstrate scientifically in his purpose-built 1924 laboratory at Kaivalyadhama that Sarvangasana (shoulderstand) specifically rehabilitated the endocrine glands (the organs that secrete hormones).
He found no evidence to support such a claim, for this or any other asana.
The impact of yoga as exercise on physical and mental health has been a topic of systematic studies (evaluating primary research), although a 2014 report found that, despite its common practice and possible health benefits, it remained "extremely understudied".
A systematic review of six studies found that Iyengar yoga is effective at least in the short term for both neck pain and low back pain.
A review of six studies found benefits for depression, but noted that the studies' methods imposed limitations, while a clinical practice guideline from the American Cancer Society stated that yoga may reduce anxiety and stress in people with cancer.
A 2015 systematic review called for more rigour in clinical trials of the effect of yoga on mood and measures of stress.
The practice of asanas has been claimed to improve flexibility, strength, and balance; to alleviate stress and anxiety, and to reduce the symptoms of lower back pain.
A review of five studies noted that three psychological (positive affect, mindfulness, self-compassion) and four biological mechanisms (posterior hypothalamus, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein and cortisol) that might act on stress had been examined empirically, whereas many other potential mechanisms remained to be studied; four of the mechanisms (positive affect, self-compassion, inhibition of the posterior hypothalamus and salivary cortisol) were found to mediate the potential stress-lowering effects of yoga.
A 2017 review found moderate-quality evidence that yoga reduces back pain.
For people with cancer, yoga may help relieve fatigue, improve psychological outcomes, and support sleep quality and life attitudes, although results vary from reviews published in 2017.
A 2015 systematic review noted that yoga may be effective in alleviating symptoms of prenatal depression.
There is evidence that practice of asanas improves birth outcomes and physical health and quality of life measures in the elderly, and reduces hypertension.
Secular religion.
From its origins in the 1920s, yoga used as exercise has had a "spiritual" aspect which is not necessarily neo-Hindu; its assimilation with Harmonial Gymnastics is an example.
Jain calls yoga as exercise "a sacred fitness regimen set apart from day-to-day life."
The yoga therapist Ann Swanson writes that "scientific principles and evidence have demystified [yoga, but] ... surprisingly, this made my transformative experiences feel even more magical."
Yoga practice sessions have, notes yoga scholar Elizabeth De Michelis, a highly specific three-part structure that matches Arnold van Gennep's 1908 definition of the basic structure of a ritual: 
1. a separation phase (detaching from the world outside); 
2. a transition or liminal state; and 
3. an incorporation or postliminal state.
For the separation phase, the yoga session begins by going into a neutral and if possible a secluded practice hall; worries, responsibilities, ego and shoes are all left outside; and the yoga teacher is treated with deference.
The actual yoga practice forms the transition state, combining practical instructions with theory, made more or less explicit.
The practitioner learns "to feel and to perceive in novel ways, most of all inwardly"; to "become silent and receptive" to help to get away from the "ego-dominated rationality of modern Western life".
The final relaxation forms the incorporation phase; the practitioner relaxes in Savasana, just as dictated by the "Hatha Yoga Pradipika" 1.32.
The posture offers "an exercise in sense withdrawal and mental quietening, and thus ... a first step towards meditative practice", a cleansing and healing process, and even a symbolic death and moment of self-renewal.
Iyengar writes that savasana puts the practitioner in "that precise state [where] the body, the breath, the mind and the brain move toward the real self ("Atma")" so as to merge into the Infinite, thus explaining the modern yoga healing ritual in terms of the Hindu Vishishtadvaita: an explanation that, De Michelis notes, practitioners are free to follow if they wish.
The yoga scholar Elliott Goldberg notes that some practitioners of yoga as exercise "inhabit their body as a means of accessing the spiritual... they use their "asana" practice as a vehicle for transcendence."
He cites yoga teacher Vanda Scaravelli's 1991 "Awakening the Spine" as an instance of such transcendence: "We learn to elongate and extend, rather than to pull and push... [and so] an unexpected opening follows, an opening from within us, giving life to the spine, as though the body had to reverse and awaken into another dimension."
In mindful yoga, the practice of asanas is combined with pranayama and meditation, using the breath and sometimes Buddhist Vipassana meditation techniques to bring the attention to the body and the emotions, thus quietening the mind.
Competition.
The idea of competitive yoga has been called an oxymoron by some people in the yoga community, such as the yoga teacher Maja Sidebaeck, but the fiercely contested Bishnu Charan Ghosh Cup, founded by Bikram Choudhury in 2003, is now held annually in Los Angeles.
Business.
By the 21st century, yoga as exercise had become a flourishing business, professionally marketed; a 2016 Ipsos study reported that 36.7 million Americans practise yoga, making the business of classes, clothing and equipment worth $16 billion in America, compared to $10 billion in 2012, and $80 billion worldwide. 72 percent of practitioners were women.
By 2010, "Yoga Journal", founded in 1975, had some 350,000 subscribers and over 1,300,000 readers.
Clothing and equipment.
Fashion has entered the world of yoga, with brands such as Lorna Jane and Lululemon offering their own ranges of women's yoga clothing.
Sales of goods such as yoga mats are increasing rapidly; sales are projected to rise to $14 billion by 2020 in North America, where the key vendors in 2016 were Barefoot Yoga, Gaiam, Jade Yoga, and Manduka, according to Technavio.
Sales of athleisure clothing such as yoga pants were worth $35 billion in 2014, forming 17% of American clothing sales.
A wide variety of instructional videos are available, some free, for yoga practice at beginner and advanced levels; by 2018, over 6,000 commercially produced titles were on sale.
Over 1,000 books have been published on yoga poses.
Yoga has reached high fashion, too: in 2011, the fashion house Gucci, noting the "halo of chic" around yoga-practising celebrities such as Madonna and Sting, produced a yoga mat costing $850 and a matching carry case in leather for $350.
In India, participants typically wear loose-fitting clothes for yoga classes, while serious practitioners in yoga ashrams practice an arduous combination of exercise, meditation, selfless service, vegetarian diet and celibacy, making yoga a way of life.
Holidays and training.
Yoga holidays (vacations) are offered in "idyllic" places around the world, including in Croatia, England, France, Greece, Iceland, Indonesia, India, Italy, Montenegro, Morocco, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Turkey; in 2018, prices were up to £1,295 (about $1,500) for 6 days.
Teacher training, as of 2017, could cost between $2,000 and $5,000.
It can take up to 3 years to obtain a teaching certificate.
Yoga training courses, as of 2017, were still unregulated in the UK; the British Wheel of Yoga has been appointed the activity's official governing body by Sport England, but it lacks power to compel training organisations, and many people are taking short unaccredited courses rather than one of the nine so far accredited.
Copyright claims.
Bikram Yoga has become a global brand, and its founder, Bikram Choudhury, spent some ten years from 2002 attempting to establish copyright on the sequence of 26 postures used in Bikram Yoga, with some initial success.
However, in 2012, the American federal court ruled that Bikram Yoga could not be copyrighted.
In 2015, after further legal action, the American court of appeals ruled that the yoga sequence and breathing exercises were not eligible for copyright protection.
In culture.
Literature.
Yoga has found its way into types of literature as varied as autobiography, chick lit, and documentary.
The actress Mariel Hemingway's 2002 autobiography "Finding My Balance: A Memoir with Yoga" describes how she used yoga to recover balance in her life after a dysfunctional upbringing: among other things, her grandfather, the novelist Ernest Hemingway, killed himself shortly before she was born.
Each chapter is titled after an asana, the first being "Mountain Pose, or Tadasana", the posture of standing in balance.
The teacher of yoga and mindful meditation Anne Cushman's 2009 novel "Enlightenment for Idiots" tells the story of a woman nearing the age of thirty whose life as a nanny and yogini hopeful isn't working out as expected, and is sure that a visit to the ashrams of India will sort out her life.
Instead, she finds that nothing in India is quite what it seems on the surface.
The "Yoga Journal" review notes that underneath the chick lit "fun romp", the book is a serious "call to enlightenment and an introduction to yoga philosophy".
Kate Churchill's 2009 film "Enlighten Up!"
follows an unemployed journalist for six months as, on the filmmaker's invitation, he travels the globe – New York, Boulder, California, Hawaii, India – to practise under yoga masters including Jois, Norman Allen, and Iyengar.
The critic Roger Ebert found it interesting and peaceful, if "not terribly eventful, but I suppose we wouldn't want a yoga thriller".
He commented: "I'm glad I saw it.
I enjoyed all the people I met during Nick's six-month quest.
Most seemed cheerful and outgoing, and exuded good health.
They smiled a lot.
They weren't creepy true believers obsessed with converting everyone."
Research.
Yoga is becoming a subject of academic inquiry; many of the researchers are "scholar practitioners" who do yoga themselves.
Medknow (part of Wolters Kluwer), with Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana university, publishes the peer-reviewed open access medical journal "International Journal of Yoga".
An increasing number of papers are being published on the possible medical benefits of yoga, such as on stress and low back pain.
The School of Oriental and African Studies in London has created a Centre of Yoga Studies; it hosted the five-year Hatha Yoga Project which traced the history of physical yoga, and it teaches a master's degree in yoga and meditation.
Academics have given yoga as exercise a variety of names, including "modern postural yoga" reflecting its emphasis on asanas (postures) and "transnational anglophone yoga" denoting its growth in the English-speaking world, especially America.
Puja (Hinduism) 
Puja () is a worship ritual performed by Hindus, Buddhists and Jains to offer devotional homage and prayer to one or more deities, to host and honor a guest, or to spiritually celebrate an event.
It may honor or celebrate the presence of special guests, or their memories after they die.
The word "pūjā" is Sanskrit, and means reverence, honor, homage, adoration, and worship.
Puja, the loving offering of light, flowers, and water or food to the divine, is the essential ritual of Hinduism.
For the worshipper, the divine is visible in the image, and the divinity sees the worshipper.
The interaction between human and deity, between human and guru, is called "darshan", seeing.
In Hindu practice, "puja" is done on a variety of occasions, frequencies, and settings.
It may include a daily puja done in the home, or occasional temple ceremonies and annual festivals.
In other cases, puja is held to mark a few lifetime events such as the birth of a baby or a wedding, or to begin a new venture.
The two main areas where puja is performed are in the home and at temples to mark certain stages of life, events or some festivals such as Durga Puja and Lakshmi Puja.
Puja is not mandatory in Hinduism.
It may be a routine daily affair for some Hindus, a periodic ritual for some, and rare for other Hindus.
In some temples, various pujas may be performed daily at various times of the day; in other temples, they may be occasional.
Puja varies according to the sect, region, occasion, deity honored, and steps followed.
In formal "Nigama" ceremonies, a fire may be lit in honor of the god Agni, without an idol or image present.
In contrast, in Agama ceremonies, an idol or icon or image of a deity is present.
In both ceremonies, a lamp (Diya) or incense stick may be lit while a prayer is chanted or a hymn is sung.
Puja is typically performed by a Hindu worshiper alone, though sometimes in the presence of a priest who is well-versed in complex rituals and hymns.
In temples and priest-assisted events puja, food, fruits, and sweets may be included as sacrificial offerings to the ceremony or deity, which, after the prayers, becomes "prasad" – food shared by all gathered.
Both Nigama and Agama puja are practiced in Hinduism in India.
In Hinduism of Bali Indonesia, Agama puja is most prevalent both inside homes and in temples.
Puja is sometimes called " Sembahyang" in Indonesia.
Etymology.
"Puja" has unclear origins.
J.
A.
B. van Buitenen states that "puja" emerged from yajna rituals, linking it to the "Pravargya" Vedic rite.
The "Rigveda" in hymn 8.17 uses the word "Sachipujanayam" (शाचिपूजनायं) in the twelfth verse, where it is an epithet for god Indra in a context of vocative singular "praise".
The ancient scholar and Vedic text commentator Sāyana explains the term as a form of "praise, worship, invocation".
The "Grhyasutras" use "puj" in the context of rites, as does Sanskrit scholar Pāṇini.
However, none of these texts imply "puja" as a form of devotional prayer worship.
According to Natalia Lidova, "puja" is unlikely to be of Indo-Aryan and Vedic origin because it lacks a Sanskrit root and it also lacks cognate parallels in other Indo-European languages.
Its root are probably Dravidian in origin, but the evidence for this alternative hypothesis is also largely missing possibly because devotional worship is not as ancient as Hinduism.
Collins states that the roots may be "pu" (flower) and "ge" (make), or a form of "making flower sacrifice".
However, this proposal is problematic because "pu" comes from an Indo-European root, while "ge" from Dravidian.
Charpentier suggests the origin of the word Puja may lie in the Dravidian languages.
Two possible Tamil roots have been suggested: 'to smear with something' or "to do with flowers" (from 'flower' and 'to do'). or similar Telugu roots (from 'flower' and 'to do').
Origins.
According to scholars, one of the earliest mentions of "pūjā" is in the Grihya Sutras, which provide rules for domestic rites.
These Sutras, dated to be about 500 BC, use the term puja to describe the hospitality to honor priests who were invited to one's home to lead rituals for departed ancestors.
As with vedic times, the general concept of puja remained the same, but expanded to welcoming the deity along with the deity's spiritual essence as one's honored guest.
The Puranic corpus of literature, dating from about 6th century CE, contain extensive outline on how to perform deity puja ("deva pūjā").
Deity puja thus melds Vedic rites with devotion to deity in its ritual form.
As with many others aspects of Hinduism, both Vedic puja and devotional deity puja continued, the choice left to the Hindu.
As a historical practice, "pūjā" in Hinduism, has been modeled around the idea of hosting a deity, or important person, as an honored and dearest guest in the best way one can, given one's resources, and receiving their happiness and blessing in return.
Paul Thieme suggests from passages in the "Rāmāyaṇa" that the word "pūjā" referred to the hospitable reception of guests and that the things offered to guests could be offered to the gods and their dwellings.
The rituals in question were the "five great sacrifices" or "pañcamahāyajña" recorded in the "Gṛhyasūtra" texts (for this literature, see Kalpa).
The development of "pūjā" thus emerged from Vedic domestic traditions and was carried into the temple environment by analogy: just as important guests had long been welcomed in well-to-do homes and offered things that pleased them, so too were the gods welcomed in temple-homes and offered things that pleased them.
Copper-plate charters recording grants of lands to temples show that this religious practice was actively encouraged from the mid-4th century.
Significance.
In the earliest texts describing Vedic puja, the significance of puja was to host the priest so that he could make direct requests to the gods.
An example petition prayer made during a Vedic puja, according to Wade Wheelock, is: 
&lt;poem&gt; 
"Indra-Agni, slayers of Vrtra with the beautiful thunderbolt, prosper us with new gifts;" 
"O Indra, bring treasures with your right hand;" 
"O Agni grant the enjoyments of a good household;" 
"Give (us) vigor, wealth in cattle, and possession of good horses."
– ÄsvSü 
&lt;/poem&gt; 
In contrast to Vedic pujas, the significance of deity pujas shifted from petitions and external goals to the experience of oneness with the deities and their spiritual essence.
It became a form of Yoga whose final result aimed to be the consciousness of god through homage to god.
Nevertheless, even with this evolved theoretical spiritual significance, for many people, puja continued to be a vehicle to petition desires and appeals, such as for good health of one's child, speedy recovery from illness, success in venture envisioned or such.
In the structure and practice of puja, the mantras and rituals focus on spirituality, and any petitions and appeals are tacked only to the end of the puja.
Zimmer relates puja to yantras, with the rituals helping the devotee focus on the spiritual concepts.
Puja in Hinduism, claims Zimmer, is a path and process of transformation of consciousness, where the devotee and the spiritual significance of the deity are brought together.
This ritual puja process, in different parts of India, is considered to be liberating, releasing, purifying and a form of Yoga of spirit and emotions.
Puja in Hinduism sometimes involves themes beyond idols or images.
Even persons, places, rivers, concrete objects or anything is seen as manifestations of divine reality by some Hindus.
The access to the divine is not limited to renunciatory meditation as in yoga school of Hinduism or idols in bhakti school.
For some the divine is everywhere, without limit to its form, and a puja to these manifestations signifies the same spiritual meaning to those who choose to offer a prayer to persons, places, rivers, concrete objects or anything else.
Temple pūjā.
Temple ("Mandir") pūjā is more elaborate than the domestic versions and typically done several times a day.
They are also performed by a temple priest, or "pujari".
In addition, the temple deity (patron god or goddess) is considered a resident rather than a guest, so the "puja" is modified to reflect that; for example the deity is "awakened" rather than "invoked" in the morning.
Temple "pujas" vary widely from region to region and for different sects, with devotional hymns sung at Vaishnava temples for example.
At a temple "puja", there is often less active participation, with the priest acting on behalf of others.
Structure, services and steps.
Elaborate pūjā.
A full home or temple "puja" can include several traditional "upacaras" or "attendances".
The following is an example "puja"; these steps may vary according to region, tradition, setting, or time particularly in ways the deity is hosted.
In this example, the deity is invited as a guest, the devotee hosts and takes care of the deity as an honored guest, hymns and food are offered to the deity, after an expression of love and respect the host takes leave and with affection expresses good bye to the deity.
Indologist Jan Gonda has identified 16 steps (shodasha upachara) that are common in all varieties of puja: 
Sometimes additional steps are included: 
There are variations in this puja method such as: 
The structure of elaborate puja also varies significantly between temples, regions, and occasions.
Archana puja is a brief intercessionary puja on behalf of an individual that can be undertaken after the main puja.
Quick pūjā.
A quick puja has the same structure as acts people would ordinarily perform for a quick reception, hospitality and affectionate interaction with a beloved guest.
First the deity is greeted, acknowledged by name and welcomed, sometimes with a "diya" or lighted incense stick.
The devotee proceeds to connect with the spiritual manifestation by meditating (a form of "darshan"), or chanting hymns and mantras, then personal prayers follow.
After the prayer is finished, the spiritual visitor as the guest is affectionately thanked and greeted goodbye.
A quick meditative puja is sometimes offered by some Hindus without an idol or image.
According to Chris Fuller, an anthropologist, Hindu texts allow flexibility and abbreviated puja according to the occasion, needs, and personal preferences.
In Balinese Hinduism.
In Hinduism of Bali Indonesia, puja is sometimes called "Sembahyang".
The word originates from two words in old Javanese: sembah and hyang.
Sembah means to respect and bow down; Hyang means divine, God or Sang Hyang Widhi Wasa, holy man, and ancestors.
So to pray means to respect, bow down, surrender to the divine and ancestors.
Sembahyang (Puja) is an obligation for Balinese Hindus, the prayers and hymns are derived from the Vedas.
A family typically offers prayers every day, with "Kewangen" and other offerings.
Kewangen means aromatic, and it is made from leaves and flowers in form of auspicious Vedic symbols.
Balinese use kewangen to worship the divine, both in form of Purusha (soul) and Pradana (body).
As with India, Balinese make offerings, including symbolic inclusion of fire, incense and mantras.
Guru puja.
In the case of great spiritual masters, there is also a custom to perform puja for a living person especially in Guru Purnima.
Gurus are sometimes chosen as objects of puja and honored as living gods or seen as the embodiment of specific deities.
Gurus are sometimes adorned with symbolic clothes, garlands and other ornaments, and celebrated with incense, washing and anointing their feet, giving them fruits, food and drinks and meditating at their feet, asking for their blessing.
As a social and human rights event.
As with church services in Christianity, Pūjā in Hinduism has served as a means for Hindu communities outside India to gather, socialize, discover new friends and sometimes discuss ways to address social discrimination of Hindus.
For example, Marion O'Callaghan reports that the Hindu diaspora brought as indentured laborers to Trinidad by the British colonial government, suffered discriminatory laws that did not recognize traditional Hindu marriages or inheritance rights of children from a traditional Hindu marriage, nor did the non-Hindu majority government allow pyre cremation or construction of crematorium.
These Hindu rituals were considered pagan and uncivilized.
Pujas offered a way for Hindus to meet, socially organize and petition their human rights.
Over time, pujas became as much a social and community recreational event as a religious event.
Critique of "pūjā" in the Pūrva Mīmāṃsaka school.
Although "pujā" is accepted as a valid religious activity by Hindus at large, it has long been criticised by Mīmāṃsā thinkers.
The foundational work of this school was the "Karmamīmāṃsāsūtra" or "Aphorisms for Enquiry into the Act," composed by Jaimini.
The earliest surviving commentary was by Śabara who lived around the end of the fourth century.
Śabara's commentary, known as "Śabarabhāṣya" held pride of place in Mīmāṃsā in that Sabara's understanding was taken as definitive by all later writers.
In his chapter entitled "Devatādikaraṇa" (9: 1: 5: 6–9), Śabara examined the popular understanding of the gods and attempted to refute the belief that they have material bodies, are able to eat the offerings made to them, and are capable of being pleased and so able to reward worshippers.
Basing himself on the Vedas (he refused to accept the "Mahābhārata", "Purāṇa" texts or even the "Smṛti" literatures as valid sources of authority), Śabara concluded that the gods are neither corporeal nor sentient and thus unable to enjoy offerings or own property.
For this he appealed to empirical observation, noting that offerings do not decrease in size when given to the gods; any decrease is simply due to exposure to the air.
Likewise he argued that substances are offered to gods not according to the wishes of the gods, but that "what is vouched for by direct perception is that the things are used according to the wishes of the temple servants ("pratyakṣāt pramāṇāt devatāparicārakāṇām abhiprāyaḥ").
In the course of his discussion, Śabara's asserted that "there is no relation between the case of guests and the sacrificial act."
This incidental remark provided sound historical proof that "pūjā" was built on analogy with "atithi", the ancient Vedic tradition of welcoming guests.
What Śabara was maintaining was that this analogy was not valid.
While the Mīmāṃsakas continued to maintain this interpretation for centuries, their defeat in debate at the hands of Śaṅkarācārya led to theirs being a minority view.
Mīmāṃsakas flourished even into the 17th century, as evidenced by the commentaries of Nīlakaṇṭha.
Regional names.
Puja is called in Tamil, "bucha" () in Thai, and sometimes also in Bengali.

Subtle body 
A subtle body is a "quasi material" aspect of the human body, being neither solely physical nor solely spiritual, according to various esoteric, occult, and mystical teachings.
This contrasts with the mind–body dualism that has dominated Western thought.
The subtle body is important in the Taoism of China and Dharmic religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, mainly in the branches which focus on tantra and yoga, where it is known as the "Sūkṣma-śarīra" ().
However, while mostly associated with Asian cultures, non-dualistic approaches to the mind and body are found in many parts of the world.
Subtle body concepts and practices can be identified as early as 2nd century BCE in Taoist texts found in the Mawangdui tombs.
It was "evidently present" in Indian thought as early as the 4th to 1st century BCE when the Taittiriya Upanishad described the Panchakoshas, a series of five interpenetrating sheaths of the body.
A fully formed subtle body theory did not develop in India until the tantric movement that affected all its religions in the Middle Ages.
In Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, the correlation of the subtle body to the physical body is viewed differently according to school, lineage and scholar, but for completion stage in yoga, it is visualised within the body.
The subtle body consists of focal points, often called chakras, connected by channels, often called nadis, that convey subtle breath, often called prana.
Through breathing and other exercises, a practitioner may direct the subtle breath to achieve supernormal powers, immortality, or liberation.
Subtle body in the Western tradition is called the "body of light".
The concept derives from the philosophy of Plato: the word 'astral' means 'of the stars'; thus the astral plane consists of the Seven Heavens of the classical planets.
Neoplatonists Porphyry and Proclus elaborated on Plato's description of the starry nature of the human psyche.
Throughout the Renaissance, philosophers and alchemists, healers including Paracelsus and his students, and natural scientists such as John Dee, continued to discuss the nature of the astral world intermediate between earth and the divine.
The concept of the astral body or body of light was adopted by 19th and 20th-century ceremonial magicians.
The Theosophy movement was the first to translate the Sanskrit term as 'subtle body', although their use of the term is quite different from Indic usage as they synthesize Western and Eastern traditions.
This makes the term problematic for modern scholars, especially as the Theosophist view often influences New Age and holistic medicine perspectives.
Western scientists have started to explore the subtle body concept in research on meditation.
Asian religions.
The Yogic, Tantric and other systems of Hinduism, Vajrayana Buddhism, as well as Chinese Taoist alchemy contain theories of subtle physiology with focal points (chakras, acupuncture points) connected by a series of channels (nadis, meridians) that convey subtle breath (prana, vayu, ch'i, ki, lung).
These invisible channels and points are understood to determine the characteristics of the visible physical form.
By understanding and mastering the subtlest levels of reality one gains mastery over the physical realm.
Through breathing and other exercises, the practitioner aims to manipulate and direct the flow of subtle breath, to achieve supernormal powers "(siddhis)" and attain higher states of consciousness, immortality, or liberation.
Hinduism.
Early.
Early concepts of the subtle body (Sanskrit: "sūkṣma śarīra") appeared in the Upanishads, including the "Brhadaranyaka Upanishad" and the "Katha Upanishad".
The "Taittiriya Upanishad" describes the theory of five koshas or sheaths, though these are not to be thought of as concentric layers, but interpenetrating at successive levels of subtlety: 
Subtle internal anatomy included a central channel (nadi).
Later Vedic texts called samhitas and brahmanas contain a theory of five "winds" or "breaths" ("vayus, pranas"): 
Later.
A millennium later, these concepts were adapted and refined by various spiritual traditions.
The similar concept of the is seen as the vehicle of consciousness in later Samkhya, Vedanta, and Yoga, and is propelled by past-life tendencies, or "bhavas".
Linga can be translated as "characteristic mark" or "impermanence" and the Vedanta term sarira as "form" or "mold".
"Karana" or "instrument" is a synonymous term.
In the Classical Samkhya system of Isvarakrsna (ca. 4th century CE), the "Lińga" is the characteristic mark of the transmigrating entity.
It consists of twenty-five tattvas from eternal consciousness down to the five organs of sense, five of activity ("buddindriya" or "jñānendriya", and "karmendriya" respectively) and the five subtle elements that are the objects of sense ("tanmatras") The "Samkhyakarika" says: 
The classical Vedanta tradition developed the theory of the five bodies into the theory of the koshas "sheaths" or "coverings" which surround and obscure the self (atman).
In classical Vedanta these are seen as obstacles to realization and traditions like Shankara's Advaita Vedanta had little interest in working with the subtle body.
Tantra.
In Tantra traditions meanwhile (Shaiva Kaula, Kashmir Shaivism and Buddhist Vajrayana), the subtle body was seen in a more positive light, offering potential for yogic practices which could lead to liberation.
Tantric traditions contain the most complex theories of the subtle body, with sophisticated descriptions of energy nadis (literally "stream or river", channels through which "vayu" and "prana" flows) and chakras, points of focus where nadis meet.
The main channels, shared by both Hindu and Buddhist systems, but visualised entirely differently, are the central (in Hindu systems: "sushumna"; in Buddhist: "avadhuti"), left and right (in Hindu systems: "ida" and "pingala"; Buddhist: "lalana" and "rasana").
Further subsidiary channels are said to radiate outwards from the chakras, where the main channels meet.
Chakra systems vary with the tantra; the "Netra Tantra" describes six chakras, the "Kaulajñana-nirnaya" describes eight, and the "Kubjikamata Tantra" describes seven (the most widely known set).
Modern.
The modern Indian spiritual teacher Meher Baba stated that the subtle body "is the vehicle of desires and vital forces".
He held that the subtle body is one of three bodies with which the soul must cease to identify in order to realize God.
Buddhism.
In Buddhist Tantra, the subtle body is termed the "innate body" () or the "uncommon means body" ("asadhdrana-upayadeha"), or , rendered in Tibetan as "traway-lu" (transliterated "phra ba’i lus").
The subtle body is sometimes known as , the “body made of mind” and is the means for synchronising the body and the mind, particularly during meditation.
The subtle body consists of thousands of subtle energy channels (nadis), which are conduits for energies or "winds" (lung or prana) and converge at chakras.
According to Dagsay Tulku Rinpoche, there are three main channels ("nadis"), central, left and right, which run from the point between the eyebrows up to the crown chakra, and down through all seven chakras to a point two inches below the navel.
Lati Rinbochay describes the subtle body as consisting of 72,000 channels, various winds and a white and a red drop whilst a further very subtle body is a wind abiding in a drop at the centre of the heart chakra.
The central channel is then described as being squeezed by two channels that encircle it at each chakra and thrice at the heart chakra, ensuring the winds do not move upward or downward until death.
Buddhist tantras generally describe four or five chakras in the shape of a lotus with varying petals.
For example, the Hevajra Tantra (8th century) states:In the Center [i.e. chakra] of Creation [at the sexual organ] a sixty-four petal lotus.
In the Center of Essential Nature [at the heart] an eight petal lotus.
In the Center of Enjoyment [at the throat] a sixteen petal lotus.
In the Center of Great Bliss [at the top of the head] a thirty-two petal lotus.In contrast, the historically later Kalachakra tantra describes six chakras.
In Vajrayana Buddhism, liberation is achieved through subtle body processes during Completion Stage practices such as the Six Yogas of Naropa.
Other traditions.
Other spiritual traditions teach about a mystical or divine body, such as "the most sacred body" ("wujud al-aqdas") and "true and genuine body" ("jism asli haqiqi") in Sufism, the meridian system in Chinese religion, and "the immortal body" ("soma athanaton") in Hermeticism.
Western esoteric tradition.
The "body of light" is elaborated on according to various Western esoteric, occult, and mystical teachings.
Other terms used for this body include "body of glory", "spirit-body", "radiant body", "luciform body", "augoeides" ('radiant'), "astroeides" ('starry' or 'sidereal body'), and "celestial body".
The concept derives from the philosophy of Plato: the word 'astral' means 'of the stars'; thus the astral plane consists of the Seven Heavens of the classical planets.
The idea is rooted in common worldwide religious accounts of the afterlife in which the soul's journey or "ascent" is described in such terms as "an ecstatic, mystical or out-of body experience, wherein the spiritual traveller leaves the physical body and travels in their body of light into 'higher' realms."
Neoplatonists Porphyry and Proclus elaborated on Plato's description of the starry nature of the human psyche.
Throughout the Renaissance, philosophers and alchemists, healers including Paracelsus and his students, and natural scientists such as John Dee, continued to discuss the nature of the astral world intermediate between earth and the divine.
The concept of the astral body or body of light was adopted by 19th-century ceremonial magician Éliphas Lévi, Florence Farr and the magicians of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, including Aleister Crowley.
Western syncretic tradition.
Theosophy.
In the 19th century, H. P. Blavatsky founded the esoteric religious system of Theosophy, which attempted to restate Hindu and Buddhist philosophy for the Western world.
She adopted the phrase "subtle body" as the English equivalent of the Vedantic "sūkṣmaśarīra", which in Adi Shankara's writings was one of three bodies (physical, subtle, and causal).
Geoffrey Samuel notes that theosophical use of these terms by Blavatsky and later authors, especially C. W. Leadbeater, Annie Besant and Rudolf Steiner (who went on to found Anthroposophy), has made them "problematic" to modern scholars, since the Theosophists adapted the terms as they expanded their ideas based on "psychic and clairvoyant insights", changing their meaning from what they had in their original context in India.
Post-theosophists.
The later theosophical arrangement was taken up by Alice Bailey, and from there found its way into the New Age worldview and the human aura.
Other authors treated the subtle body in varying ways.
Max Heindel divided the subtle body into the Vital Body made of Ether; the Desire body, related to the Astral plane; and the Mental body.
Barbara Brennan's account of the subtle bodies in her books "Hands of Light" and "Light Emerging" refers to the subtle bodies as "layers" in the "Human Energy Field" or aura.
Fourth Way.
Subtle bodies are found in the "Fourth Way" teachings of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky, which claim that one can create a subtle body, and hence achieve post-mortem immortality, through spiritual or yogic exercises.
The "soul" in these systems is not something one is born with, but developed through esoteric practice to acquire complete understanding and to perfect the self.
According to the historian Bernice Rosenthal, "In Gurdjieff's cosmology our nature is tripartite and is composed of the physical (planetary), emotional (astral) and mental (spiritual) bodies; in each person one of these three bodies ultimately achieves dominance."
The ultimate task of the fourth way teachings is to harmoniously develop the four bodies into a single way.
Meditation research.
Western scientists have started to explore the subtle body concept in relation to research on meditation.
The subtle body model can be cross-referenced onto modern maps of the central nervous system, and applied in research on meditation.
Sahaja 
Sahaja ( ) means spontaneous enlightenment in Indian and Tibetan Buddhist spirituality.
Sahaja practices first arose in Bengal during the 8th century among yogis called Sahajiya siddhas.
Ananda Coomaraswamy describes its significance as "the last achievement of all thought", and "a recognition of the identity of spirit and matter, subject and object", continuing "There is then no sacred or profane, spiritual or sensual, but everything that lives is pure and void."
Etymology.
The Sanskrit [and the Tibetan, which precisely follows it] literally means: 'born or produced together or at the same time as.
Congenital, innate, hereditary, original, natural (...by birth, by nature, naturally...)'.
Etymologically, means 'together with', and derives from the root , meaning 'to be born, produced, to occur, to happen'.
The Tibetan is an exact etymological equivalent of the Sanskrit. means 'together with', and means 'to be born, to arise, to come about, to be produced'.
The Tibetan can function as a verbal phrase, noun, or adjective.
Origins and Buddhist Sahajayana.
The siddha Saraha (8th century CE) was the founder of the Hindu movement, with crossover with some Vajrayana Buddhist elements, termed "Sahajayana," which flourished in Bengal and Odisha.
Sahajiya mahasiddhas like Saraha, Kanha, Savari and Luipa were tantric Hindus and Buddhists who expounded their beliefs in songs and dohas in the Apabhraṃśa languages and Bengali.
Many of the songs in this tradition are preserved in the Charyapada.
Sahajiyas such as Saraha believed that enlightenment could be achieved in this lifetime, by laypersons living in samsara.
The sahajiyas practiced a form of ritual union which was supposed to bring the female and male elements together in balance.
Saraha and his disciples were also master practitioners of Mahamudra meditation, and Saraha composed a famous Mahamudra meditation text along with his 'Three Cycles of Doha', a series of yogic songs.
Sahajiyas also criticized the Hindu caste system.
Sahajayana Buddhism became very popular in the Pala Empire, especially among commoners.
One of the classic texts associated with the Sahajiya Buddhists is the Hevajra Tantra.
The tantra describes four kinds of Joy (ecstasy): 
"From Joy there is some bliss, from Perfect Joy yet more.
From the Joy of Cessation comes a passionless state.
The Joy of Sahaja is finality.
The first comes by desire for contact, the second by desire for bliss, the third from the passing of passion, and by this means the fourth [Sahaja] is realized.
Perfect Joy is samsara [mystic union].
The Joy of Cessation is nirvana.
Then there is a plain Joy between the two.
Sahaja is free of them all.
For there is neither desire nor absence of desire, nor a middle to be obtained."
The siddha, Indrabhuti, wrote a commentary on Sahaja teachings called the "."
In the Nāth tradition.
is one of the four keywords of the Nath sampradaya along with Svecchachara, Sama, and Samarasa. meditation and worship was prevalent in Tantric traditions common to Hinduism and Buddhism in Bengal as early as the 8th–9th centuries.
The British Nath teacher Mahendranath wrote: 
The concept of a spontaneous spirituality entered Hinduism with Nath yogis such as Gorakshanath and was often alluded to indirectly and symbolically in the twilight language () common to traditions as found in the "Charyapada" and works by Matsyendranath and Daripada.
It influenced the bhakti movement through the Sant tradition, exemplified by the Bauls of Bengal, NamdevDnyaneshwar, Meera, Kabir and Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism.
Yoga in particular had a quickening influence on the various traditions.
The culture of the body () through processes of Haṭha-yoga was of paramount importance in the Nāth sect and found in all schools.
Whether conceived of as 'supreme bliss' (), as by the Buddhist Sahajiyās, or as 'supreme love' (as with the Vaiṣṇava Sahajiyās), strength of the body was deemed necessary to stand such a supreme realisation.
Vaishnava-Sahajiya.
The sect became popular in 17th century Bengal.
It sought religious experience through the five senses.
The divine relationship between Krishna and Radha (guises of the divine masculine and divine feminine) had been celebrated by Chandidas (Bangla: ) (born 1408 CE), Jayadeva (circa 1200 CE) and Vidyapati (c 1352 - c 1448) whose works foreshadowed the "rasas" or "flavours" of love.
The two aspects of absolute reality were explained as the eternal enjoyer and the enjoyed, Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā, as may be realised through a process of attribution (), in which the Rasa of a human couple is transmuted into the divine love between Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā, leading to the highest spiritual realisation, the state of union or .
The element of love, the innovation of the school, is essentially based on the element of yoga in the form of physical and psychological discipline.
is a synthesis and complex of traditions that, due to its tantric practices, was perceived with disdain by other religious communities and much of the time was forced to operate in secrecy.
Its literature employed an encrypted and enigmatic style.

Standing Baba 
A Standing Baba, or Khareshwari, is a Hindu who has vowed to stand, not sitting or lying down even to sleep.
The vow is a form of Hindu Tapa (or Tapasas), a self-inflicted corporal punishment intended to help bring spiritual enlightenment.
Khareshwari are primarily found in India, but are not limited to that country.
The length of the vow is unclear from available references.
One source says that the vow lasts for twelve years.
Other sources do not attach a specific time frame.
Khareshwari traditionally stood under a tree.
This may be connected to the Yoga position known as Vrikasana, the Tree Position.
A seventeenth-century engraving shows some images of what may be Standing Baba.
More recently Khareshwari seem to stand inside.
Author Gregory David Roberts places Babas inside in his description of Khareshwari in the novel "Shantaram".
Additionally, two online photos of Khareshwari both show men inside, not under a tree.
The Standing Baba have a swing-like device that allows them to rest their arms during the day.
During the night, a Khareshwari will support his torso on the swing as he sleeps.
The swing usually has a sling beneath it.
The sling can hold one of the Khareshwari's legs at a time.
It is unclear if this is intended to rest one leg or to increase the pressure on the other leg.
While Khareshwaris may walk about, they usually just stand/hang in their swing.
Standing for years at a time causes swollen legs and ulcerated feet.
Roberts and others describe the Khareshwari tapa as extremely painful and even permanently disabling.
Kriya Yoga school 
Kriya Yoga (Sanskrit: क्रिया योग) is described by its practitioners as an ancient yoga system revived in modern times by Lahiri Mahasaya, who claimed to be initiated by a guru, Mahavatar Babaji, circa 1861 in the Himalayas.
Kriya Yoga was brought to international awareness by Paramahansa Yogananda's book "Autobiography of a Yogi" and through Yogananda's introductions of the practice to the west from 1920.
The Kriya yoga system consists of a number of levels of pranayama, mantra, and mudra, intended to rapidly accelerate spiritual development and engender a profound state of tranquility and God-communion.
Etymology.
In "Kriya Yoga pranayama", "kriya" refers to revolving the life energy "upward and downward, around the six spinal centers."
According to Yogananda, "Kriya is an ancient science.
Lahiri Mahasaya received it from his great guru, Babaji, who rediscovered and clarified the technique after it had been lost in the Dark Ages.
Babaji renamed it, simply, Kriya Yoga."
According to David Gordon White, "while [Yogananda] called his particular Kriya Yoga, the term used for "practical yoga" in Yoga Sutras 2.1-27, Patanjali's work is conspicuously absent from his writings."
History.
Lahiri Mahasaya.
The origins of the present day forms of Kriya Yoga can be traced back to Lahiri Mahasaya, who reported to have received initiation into the yoga techniques from an elusive, immortal Indian yogi saint, commonly referred to as Mahavatar Babaji, who supposedly lived in the second century CE.
The story of Lahiri Mahasaya receiving initiation into Kriya Yoga by Mahavatar Babaji in 1861 is recounted in "Autobiography of a Yogi".
Yogananda wrote that at that meeting, Mahavatar Babaji told Lahiri Mahasaya, "The Kriya Yoga that I am giving to the world through you in this nineteenth century, is a revival of the same science that Krishna gave millenniums ago to Arjuna; and was later known to Patanjali, and Christ, and to St. John, St. Paul, and other disciples."
Yogananda also wrote that Babaji and Christ were in continual communion and together, "have planned the spiritual technique of salvation for this age."
Through Lahiri Mahasaya, Kriya Yoga soon spread throughout India.
Lahiri Mahasaya's disciples included his two sons, Dukouri Lahiri and Tinkouri Lahiri, Sri Yukteswar Giri, Panchanan Bhattacharya, Swami Pranabananda, Swami Kebalananda, Keshavananda Brahmachari, Bhupendranath Sanyal (Sanyal Mahasaya), and many others .
Paramahansa Yogananda.
Kriya Yoga was brought to international awareness by Paramahansa Yogananda, a disciple of Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri, with his book "Autobiography of a Yogi" and through Yogananda's introductions of the practice to the west from 1920.
Practice.
Kriya Yoga, as taught by Lahiri Mahasaya, is traditionally exclusively learned via the Guru-disciple relationship and the initiation consists of a secret ceremony.
He recounted that after his initiation into Kriya Yoga, "Babaji instructed me in the ancient rigid rules which govern the transmission of the yogic art from Guru to disciple."
As Yogananda describes Kriya Yoga, "The Kriya Yogi mentally directs his life energy to revolve, upward and downward, around the six spinal centers (medullary, cervical, dorsal, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal plexuses) which correspond to the twelve astral signs of the zodiac, the symbolic Cosmic Man.
One half-minute of revolution of energy around the sensitive spinal cord of man effects subtle progress in his evolution; that half-minute of Kriya equals one year of natural spiritual unfoldment."
The process of performing Kriya Yoga is claimed to lead to a certain purification of the blood which frees up the life force to withdraw into the spine.
""Kriya Yoga" is a simple, psycho-physiological method by which the human blood is decarbonized and recharged with oxygen.
The atoms of this extra oxygen are transmuted into life current to rejuvenate the brain and spinal centers.
By stopping the accumulation of venous blood, the yogi is able to lessen or prevent the decay of tissues; the advanced yogi transmutes his cells into pure energy.
Elijah, Jesus, Kabir and other prophets were past masters in the use of "Kriya" or a similar technique, by which they caused their bodies to materialize and dematerialize at will."
Swami Satyananda wrote "Kriya sadhana may be thought of as the sadhana of the 'practice of being in Atman'.
There are many higher kriyas in the kriya yoga tradition.
According to the "Autobiography of a Yogi", Lahiri Mahasaya divided Kriya Yoga into four parts.
The second, third and the fourth Kriya are known as higher Kriyas, Thokar Kriya being one of them.
Sources and inspirations.
According to Yogananda, the elusive Mahavatar Babaji introduced the concept of "Kriya Yoga pranayama" as essentially identical to the Raja Yoga of Patanjali and the concept of Yoga as described in the "Bhagavad Gita".
According to Yogananda, Kriya Yoga was well known in ancient India, but was eventually lost, due to "priestly secrecy and man’s indifference".
A direct disciple of Sri Yukteswar Giri, Sailendra Dasgupta (d. 1984) has written that, "Kriya entails several acts that have evidently been adapted from the Gita, the Yoga Sutras, Tantra shastras and from conceptions on the Yugas."
Bhagavad Gita.
The "Bhagavad Gita" does not teach "Kriya Yoga pranayama" by name, though Yogananda claimed that the practice was described there.
According to Paramahansa Yogananda in his book "", Krishna describes kriya Yoga thus: 
Yogananda also stated that Krishna was referring to "Kriya Yoga pranayama" when "Krishna ... relates that it was he, in a former incarnation, who communicated the indestructible yoga to an ancient illuminato, Vivasvat, who gave it to Manu, the great legislator.
He, in turn, instructed Ikshwaku, the father of India’s solar warrior dynasty."
Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.
Yoga Sutras 2.1..
According to Yogananda, "Kriya Yoga is mentioned twice by the ancient sage Patanjali, foremost exponent of yoga, who wrote: "Kriya Yoga consists of 
body discipline, mental control, and meditating on Aum."—Yoga Sutras II:1."
The "Yoga Sutras of Patanjali" 2.1 actually uses the term "kriya yoga" when describing a "yoga of action (kriyayoga)," defining three types of kriya (action): 
According to George Feuerstein, this "kriya yoga" is contained in chapter 1, chapter 2 verse 1-27, chapter 3 except verse 54, and chapter 4.
The "eight limb yoga" is described in chapter 2 verse 28–55, and chapter 3 verse 3 and 54.
According to Miller, "Kriya yoga" as described in the Yoga Sutras is the "active performance of yoga."
It is part of the niyamas, "observances", the second limb of Patanjali's eight limbs.
Yoga Sutras 2.49.
Yogananda stated that Patanjali wrote a second time about the "Kriya Yoga pranayama" technique when he wrote: "Liberation can be attained by that pranayama which is accomplished by disjoining the course of inspiration and expiration" (YS 2.49).
Dissimilar traditions.
The Bihar School of Yoga, which teaches similar techniques of "Kriya Yoga pranayama", states that the descriptions of kriya yoga in the "Yoga Sūtras" and the "Bhagavad Gīta" are not related.
Guru-shishya parampara of Kriya Yoga.
The lineage of Self-Realization Fellowship (SRF)/Yogoda Satsanga Society of India (YSS), founded by Paramahansa Yogananda includes Jesus Christ, Bhagavan Krishna, Mahavatar Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, Sri Yukteswar Giri and Paramahansa Yogananda.
According to SRF, Yogananda stated, before his passing, that it was "God's wish that he be the last in the SRF line of Gurus."
When questioned about the succession of SRF/YSS leadership, Yogananda answered, “There will always be at the head of this organization men and women of realization.
They are already known to God and the Gurus.
They shall serve as my spiritual successor and representative in all spiritual and organizational matters.”
According to the Kriya Yoga Institute, their lineage includes Mahavatar Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, Sri Yukteswar Giri, Shrimat Bhupendranath Sanyal Mahashaya, Paramahansa Yogananda, Satyananda Giri, Hariharananda Giri 
Aksara 
Aksara (also "akshara", Devanagari अक्षर, IAST "akṣara") is a Sanskrit term translating to "imperishable, indestructible, fixed, immutable" (i.e. from अ, "a-" "not" and क्षर्, "kṣar-" "melt away, perish").
It has two main fields of application, in Sanskrit grammatical tradition (śikṣā) and in Vedanta philosophy.
The uniting aspect of these uses is the mystical view of language, or shabda, in Hindu tradition, and especially the notion of the "syllable" as a kind of immutable (or "atomic") substance of both language and truth, most prominently, the mystical syllable Aum, which is given the name of "ekākṣara" (i.e. "eka-akṣara"), which can be translated as both "the sole imperishable thing" and as "a single syllable".
In the explicitly monotheistic tradition of Bhakti yoga, both "akṣara" and "aum" become seen as a symbol or name of God.
Grammatical tradition.
The akshara is the unit of graphemic symbols in the Brahmic scripts.
An akshara is more a syllable-like unit for writing which requires the knowledge of syllables and the "matra", i.e. the measure of prosodic marking.
In writing it prototypically stands for CV, CVV, CCV, CCVV, CCCV, CCCVV, V and VV where "C" stands for a consonant, "V" for a vowel and "VV" for a long vowel.
It is usually a sub-syllabic representation which stands for onset, onset plus nucleus and nucleus alone; the coda part of a syllable goes into the next akshara in a word.
Its nature favours the phonological mediation i.e. the non-lexical strategy of reading, which may be interpreted in stages such as the "Visual Analysis System" and proceeding to the "Aksara Recognition System" and then to the "Aksara sound Conversion System" and the "Phonological Assembly System" before ending with the "Response Buffer" prior to reading aloud.
Vedanta.
Aum.
As part of basic instructions of Shiksha and Sanskrit grammar, it is explained that among the Word-entities, both, Aksara and Brahman stand out as especially important because both refer to a special form of ritual word.
In the Brahmanas and the Upanishads both come to mean the Absolute.
Vedantic philosophy identified the "aum" syllable as alluded to in various concepts going back to the Rigveda, such as the concept of the "word" or "vāc" (e.g. RV 1.55.1) or inspiration (1.34.4, 8.36.7).
"It is the recipient of power and the dignity of the sacred word in a condensated and intensified degree, and as the essence and embryo of speech receives, more than the word itself the signification of transcendent Brahman".
In the Rigveda itself, "akṣára" does occur, but it is used as a name of "water" (RV 1.34.4, 1.164.42).
The Manduka Upanishad partitions the symbol Aum in three different morae and adds a fourth mora-less part instructing that the mora-less part alone is ultimately real and not the other three representing "wakefulness", "dream" and the "sleep" states of consciousness.
The mora-less part of Aum has correspondence with the fourth dimension of metaphysics, the Atman.
Madhavananda in his commentary on the Brahmopanishad belonging to the Atharvaveda, explains that vide Mundaka Upanishad I.7 and II.1-2 the term Aksara signifies Brahman in Its aspect of the manifesting principle who Pippalada says is the thread (Sutram) to be worn instead of the sacrificial thread on the body which should be discarded.
Bhagavad Gita.
According to the adherents of the Smrtis, the practitioners of the Bhakti yoga, Aksara means one who is present everywhere, denotes the name of Shiva and Vishnu, and also that of Brahman, literally it means imperishable, indestructible.
And, because it is the term applied to Aum it is called the Aksara, the symbol of God who is the lord of all created things.
It is a descriptive synonym of Brahman (Bhagavad Gita VIII.3) who is said to have arisen from Aksara (Bhagavad Gita III.15).
With regard to Vallabha’s view of Aum it is said that Aksara itself is imperishable and appears as souls endowed with Sat and "Chit" but not as Ananda.
For Vallabha, Ananda, which is the first manifestation of God, is the actualisation of the absolute identity and selfness, whereas the second manifestation of God is the Aksara, the impersonal ground from which all determinations arise because it is the substratum of all finite forms that pre-exist but issue forth from it which though by itself is the intermediate form that lacks plenitude.
Rishikesh 
Rishikesh, also spelt as Hrishikesh, is a city near Dehradun in Dehradun district of the Indian state Uttarakhand.
It is situated on the right bank of the Ganges River and is a pilgrimage town for Hindus, with ancient sages and saints meditating here in search of higher knowledge.
There are numerous temples and ashrams built along the banks of the river.
It is known as the ""Gateway to the Garhwal Himalayas" and "Yoga Capital of the World"".
The city has hosted the annual "International Yoga Festival" on the first week of March since 1999.
Rishikesh is a vegetarian-only and alcohol-free city.
The Tehri Dam is just away and Uttarkashi, a popular yoga destination, is uphill on the way to Gangotri.
Rishikesh is the starting point for travelling to the four Chota Char Dham pilgrimage places: Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri, and Yamunotri.
It is a starting point for Himalayan tourist destinations such as Harsil, Chopta, Auli, and summer and winter trekking destinations like Dodital, Dayara Bugyal, Kedarkantha, Har Ki Dun for camping and panoramic Himalayan views.
In September 2015, the Indian Minister of Tourism Mahesh Sharma announced that Rishikesh and Haridwar would be the first "twin national heritage cities".
As of 2021, Rishikesh has a total population of 322,825 with the tehsil including the city and its 93 surrounding villages.
The city is governed by Rishikesh Municipal Corporation and tehsil.
Etymology.
IAST: "" () is a name derived from Vishnu, composed of "hṛṣīka" meaning 'senses' and "īśa" meaning 'lord' for a combined meaning as 'Lord of the Senses'.
The name commemorates an apparition of Vishnu to Raibhya Rishi, as a result of his tapasya (austerities), as Lord Hrishikesha.
In the Skanda Purana, this area is known as Kubjāmraka (), as Lord Vishnu appeared under a mango tree.
History.
Rishikesh was part of the legendary "Kedarkhand" mentioned in the Skanda Purana.
Legends state that Lord Rama did penance here for killing Ravana, the asura king of Lanka.
Lakshmana, Rama's younger brother, crossed the Ganges using two jute ropes at the point where the present Lakshman Jhula () suspension bridge stands today.
The 248-foot long iron-rope suspension bridge built in 1889 was washed away by flooding in 1924.
In 1927, it was replaced by the current, stronger bridge built by the United Provinces Public Works Department, connecting the Tapovan, Tehri and Jonk, Pauri Garhwal districts.
Anoted suspension bridge named Ram Jhula was built in 1986 at the nearby Sivananda Nagar.
The Skanda Purana also mentions the site as "Indrakund" where Indra underwent a holy bath to remove a curse.
"The Gazeteer of Dehradun", written by Indian Civil Service officer HG Walton, describes the site as "beautifully situated on the right bank of the Ganges, on a high cliff overlooking the river.
The place is developing very rapidly, especially since the construction of the new bridge over the Song river, the realignment of the pilgrim road from Raiwala to Rishikesh."
The Ganges, one of the most sacred rivers to Hindus, flows through Rishikesh in its course from the Shivalik Hills of the Himalayas to the plains of northern India with temples built along the banks Shatrughna Mandir, Bharat Mandir, and Lakshman Mandir are the ancient temples established by Adi Shankaracharya.
Shatrughna Temple is near the Ram Jhula suspension bridge, while Lakshman Mandir is situated near Lakshman Jhula suspension bridge.
The historical records mention that some pilgrims used to stay at Rishikesh, either seeking the site itself or using it as a resting place before moving onwards to the Himalayas.
In the transition to a modern tourist town, local markets have evolved from commercializing goods such as local and religious handicrafts to a service-oriented tourist industry with provision stores, cafes, hotels, sites for rafting, and centers for yoga and meditation.
Geography.

After flowing 249 km (155.343 mi) through narrow Himalayan valleys, the Ganges emerges at Rishikesh before debouching onto the Gangetic Plain at the pilgrimage town of Haridwar.
Despite the pollution of the Ganges, the water in Rishikesh is relatively unaffected, as the major polluting points are down river in the neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh.
According to the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system, its climate is humid subtropical (Cwa).
The average maximum temperature is 40 °C (104 °F).
The average minimum temperature is 7 °C.
The wettest month is July with highest rainfall of 444 mm.
The driest month is November with rainfall of 10 mm. Months of May, June, July and August has the highest UV index of 12 and January and December have the lowest UV index of 4.
Civic Administration.
The Rishikesh Municipal Corporation has administered the city's 40 wards since the 2018 incorporation of the urban local body.
Each ward had between 2,300-3,000 residents during the 2018 assessment.
Rishikesh belongs to the Haridwar Lok Sabha constituency.
The first and the current mayor of the corporation is Anita Mamgain.
The current Municipal Commissioner, commonly known as Nagar Aayukt locally, is Narendra Singh.
Demographics.
As per provisional data of 2011 census, Rishikesh had a population of 102,138, out of which males were 54,466 (53%) and females were 47,672 (47%).
The literacy rate was 86.86% compared to the national average of 74.04%.
Tourism.
In the 2021-2022 fiscal year, Rishikesh had the highest revenue per hotel room among Indian tourist leisure destinations with an average of ₹10,042 per night.
The town is one of the favourites of Israeli tourists, who often come here after completing their mandatory IDF service.
Yoga "Capital".
In February 1968, the Beatles visited Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram in Rishikesh, attracted by his Transcendental Meditation.
The Beatles composed numerous songs during their time at the ashram, many of which appear on the band's self-titled double album, also known as the "White Album".
Western fans arrived seeking similar experiences, resulting in new yoga and meditation centers that fueled Rishikesh's nickname as the "Yoga Capital of the World".
Many of these Westerners have undergone training to become certified yoga teachers.
The city's Sivananda Nagar houses the Sivananda Ashram and Divine Life Society, founded by Swami Sivananda.
The Ram Jhula and Lakshman Jhula suspension bridges are accompanied by temples with additional ashrams near Swargashram along the eastern riverbank.
Neelkanth Mahadev Temple is located in the forest, from Rishikesh, while Vashishtha Guha, a cave used by the sage Vashishtha, is north of the area.
Activities.
The Ganga Aarti (also known as Maha Aarthi) is performed at dusk at the Triveni Ghat.
This popular Hindu religious ritual involves playing music and providing religious offerings to a fire.
In 1939, the British completed construction on a 137 m (450 ft) long iron suspension bridge on Ganges River at the spot where Lakshman (Rama’s brother) crossed the Ganges on a jute rope.
Rishikesh offers many rafting options along the Ganges from Grades I-IV.
Rishikesh has India's highest bungee jumping at 83m over a rocky cliff, which has been experienced by over 100,000 tourists.
The longest flying fox (also known as a zipline) in Asia is in Rishikesh with a length of 1 km and speeds of 140 km per hour.
Riverside Camps.
According to environmental activists, "These camps are not only in violation of Forest (Conservation) Act 1980, but also the Environment (Protection) Act 1986, as well as the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1974, as it is leading to pollution of Ganga by discharging effluent, throwing of solid waste directly and adversely affecting the ecological integrity of the river system."
Environmental activists allege that these camps, which are established as temporary sites, do not have adequate sewage and sanitation facilities, disturb the habitat of wild animals, and "affect the peace, tranquility, and serenity of the forest area.
[...]
At the campsites, the camp owners permit employees and the visitors to have food and alcohol.
They leave empty bottles, cans, unconsumed food and waste including bones and filth in and around the campsite."
In a 2008 study on the beach camps between Kaudiyala and Rishikesh, experts from the Govind Ballabh Pant Himalayan Environment and Development Institute—R. K. Maikhuri, Nihal Farukhi and Tarun Budhal—found that wildlife conservation standards and norms, particularly for waste management, were routinely disregarded.
A bench headed by the National Green Tribunal chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar on 1 April 2015 heard a plea filed by the non-governmental organisation Social Action for Forest and Environment (SAFE).
The National Green Tribunal has sought explanations from the Government of India and the Government of Uttarakhand on the "unregulated" operation of rafting camps on the banks of Ganga between Shivpuri and Rishikesh in Uttarakhand.
The state government has assured the tribunal that it would not grant permission to any new camp till the next hearing in May.
As the seriousness of issue "The National Green Tribunal," a bench headed by Justice U. D. Salve has rejected permission to rafting camps operating in Rishikesh and slammed the Ministry of Environment and Forests and the Government of Uttarakhand for not filing their replies in the case and directed them to file their response.
Healthcare.
AIIMS Rishikesh is one of the six healthcare institutes being established by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India under the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY) with the aim of correcting regional imbalances in quality tertiary level healthcare in the country and attaining self-sufficiency in graduate and postgraduate medical education and training.
The first AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy) Centre was opened in Rishikesh on 4 June 2015 by Shripad Yasso Naik, the Minister for Yoga and Traditional Medicine, to sponsor new research in these alternative medicine systems.
Transport.
Rail.
The Rishikesh and the Yog Nagari Rishikesh railway stations offer service to this city, partially through Indian Railways.
A new railway line, connecting Rishikesh with Karnaprayag, is under construction.
Road.
Rishikesh is connected with the state capital, Dehradun, which is 12 km from the city.
Private and shared taxi services travel between Rishikesh and most major north Indian cities like Delhi, Chandigarh, and Shimla.
Air.
The nearest Airports are Dehradun Airport (15 km) and New Delhi International Airport (240 km).
Effect on spiritual environment.
The tourism sector has brought tourists illegally importing cannabis and alcohol.
Incidents like partial nakedness and drug paraphernalia littered along beaches is producing criticism that Rishikesh is losing its spirituality.
The riverside has spiritual and religious significance because it represents the emergence of the Ganges after the confluence of the Bhagirathi and Alaknanda rivers at Devprayag in the Garhwal Himalayas.
Saints and yogis have been meditating on the banks of Ganges since antiquity.
Alpha wave 
Alpha waves, or the alpha rhythm, are neural oscillations in the frequency range of 8–12 Hz likely originating from the synchronous and coherent (in phase or constructive) electrical activity of thalamic pacemaker cells in humans.
Historically, they are also called "Berger's waves" after Hans Berger, who first described them when he invented the EEG in 1924.
Alpha waves are one type of brain waves detected by electrophysiological and closely related methods, such as by electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG), and can be quantified using quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG).
They can be predominantly recorded from the occipital lobes during wakeful relaxation with closed eyes and were the earliest brain rhythm recorded in humans.
Alpha waves are reduced with open eyes and sleep, while they are enhanced during drowsiness.
Historically, they were thought to represent the activity of the visual cortex in an idle state.
More recent papers have argued that they inhibit areas of the cortex not in use, or alternatively that they play an active role in network coordination and communication.
Occipital alpha waves during periods of eyes closed are the strongest EEG brain signals.
An alpha-like variant called a mu wave can be found over the primary motor cortex.
Research.
Possible types and origins.
Some researchers posit that there are at least two forms of alpha waves, which may have different functions in the wake-sleep cycle.
Alpha waves are present at different stages of the wake-sleep cycle.
The most widely researched is during the relaxed mental state, where the subject is at rest with eyes closed, but is not tired or asleep.
This alpha activity is centered in the occipital lobe, although there has been speculation that it has a thalamic origin.
This wave begins appearing at around four months, and is initially a frequency of 4 waves per second.
The mature alpha wave, at 10 waves per second, is firmly established by age 3.
The second occurrence of alpha wave activity is during REM sleep.
As opposed to the awake form of alpha activity, this form is located in a frontal-central location in the brain.
The purpose of alpha activity during REM sleep has yet to be fully understood.
Currently, there are arguments that alpha patterns are a normal part of REM sleep, and for the notion that it indicates a semi-arousal period.
It has been suggested that this alpha activity is inversely related to REM sleep pressure.
It has long been believed that alpha waves indicate a wakeful period during sleep.
This has been attributed to studies where subjects report non-refreshing sleep and have EEG records reporting high levels of alpha intrusion into sleep.
This occurrence is known as alpha wave intrusion.
However, it is possible that these explanations may be misleading, as they only focus on alpha waves being generated from the occipital lobe.
Meditation.
Mindfulness meditation has been shown to increase alpha wave power in both healthy subjects and patients.
Practitioners of Transcendental Meditation have demonstrated a one-Hertz reduction in alpha wave frequency relative to controls.
Alpha wave intrusion.
Alpha wave intrusion occurs when the alpha waves appear with non-REM sleep when delta activity is expected.
It is hypothesized to be associated with fibromyalgia with increased phasic alpha sleep activity correlated with clinical manifestations of fibromyalgia, such as longer pain duration.
Despite this, alpha wave intrusion has not been significantly linked to any major sleep disorder, including chronic fatigue syndrome, and major depression.
However, it is common in chronic fatigued patients, and may amplify the effects of other sleep disorders.
Mistake prediction.
Following this lapse-of-attention line of thought, a recent study indicates that alpha waves may be used to predict mistakes.
In it, MEGs measured increases of up to 25% in alpha brain wave activity before mistakes occurred.
This study used common sense: alpha waves indicate idleness, and mistakes are often made when a person is doing something automatically, or "on auto-pilot", and not paying attention to the task they are performing.
After the mistake was noticed by the subject, there was a decrease in alpha waves as the subject began paying more attention.
This study hopes to promote the use of wireless EEG technology on employees in high-risk fields, such as air traffic controlling, to monitor alpha wave activity and gauge the attention level of the employee.
Processing of visual information in memory.
A study has shown that the appearance of an alpha rhythm with open eyes can be a predictor of visual information processing in working memory.
It was shown that the moment of appearance of alpha activity depends on the type of stimulus in memory and the number of visual characteristics (color, shape, etc.) that it needs to keep in memory.
The authors suggest that the appearance of the alpha rhythm with open eyes may indicate a temporary shutdown of visual information processing in the primary visual cortex at the moments when the subject analyzes the image in visual memory.
At these moments, information is processed in the association areas of the visual cortex (hV4, V3v, VO1, VO2 areas).
Visual learning.
One study suggests that a "visual flicker paradigm to entrain individuals at their own brain rhythm (i.e. peak alpha frequency)" can result in faster perceptual visual learning, maintained the day following training.
In particular, the entrainment substantially accelerated learning in a discrimination task to detect targets embedded in background clutter or to identify radial vs. concentric Glass patterns embedded in noise compared to entrainment that does not match an individual's alpha frequency.
Measurement.
EEG artefacts.
As demonstrated by Dr. Adrian R. M. Upton, it is possible for extraneous sources (ambient fluctuations detected with a mound of Jell-O in Upton's experiments) to cause signals to appear on an EEG readout, causing false signals to be interpreted as healthy alpha waves.
This finding suggests that it is possible that a non-flat EEG could lead to the interpretation that a patient is still living when in fact he or she is long dead.
Cecil Adams from The Straight Dope discusses this scenario: 
Sometimes it's claimed Jell-O brainwaves are identical to a healthy adult's.
That's clearly a stretch, but the Jell-O EEG readings do look pretty similar to a normal human alpha rhythm.
Alpha waves are observed when a patient is awake and resting with eyes closed, and in some kinds of sleep and reversible coma.
True, the Jell-O waves are a little slower and of much lower amplitude, barely within normal human limits, but that doesn't tell you much by itself.
Hypoxia, encephalitis, and other medical conditions can cause reduced frequency and amplitude, as can drug use.
History.
Alpha waves were discovered by German neurologist Hans Berger, the inventor of the EEG itself.
Alpha waves were among the first waves documented by Berger, along with beta waves, and he displayed an interest in "alpha blockage", the process by which alpha waves decrease and beta waves increase upon a subject opening their eyes.
This distinction earned the alpha wave the alternate title of "Berger's Wave".
Berger took a cue from Ukrainian physiologist Vladimir Pravdich-Neminsky, who used a string galvanometer to create a photograph of the electrical activity of a dog's brain.
Using similar techniques, Berger confirmed the existence of electrical activity in the human brain.
He first did this by presenting a stimulus to hospital patients with skull damage and measuring the electrical activity in their brains.
Later he ceased the stimulus method and began measuring the natural rhythmic electrical cycles in the brain.
The first natural rhythm he documented was what would become known as the alpha wave.
Berger was very thorough and meticulous in his data-gathering, but despite his brilliance, he did not feel confident enough to publish his discoveries until at least five years after he had made them.
In 1929, he published his first findings on alpha waves in the journal "Archiv für Psychiatrie".
He was originally met with derision for his EEG technique and his subsequent alpha and beta wave discoveries.
His technique and findings did not gain widespread acceptance in the psychological community until 1937, when he gained the approval of the famous physiologist Lord Adrian, who took a particular interest in alpha waves.
Alpha waves again gained recognition in the early 1960s and 1970s with the creation of a biofeedback theory relating to brain waves (see below).
Such biofeedback, referred to as a kind of neurofeedback, relating to alpha waves is the conscious elicitation of alpha brainwaves by a subject.
Two researchers in the United States explored this concept through unrelated experiments.
Joe Kamiya, of the University of Chicago, discovered that some individuals had the conscious ability to recognize when they were creating alpha waves, and could increase their alpha activity.
These individuals were motivated through a reward system from Kamiya.
The second progenitor of biofeedback is Barry Sterman, from the University of California, Los Angeles.
He was working with monitoring brain waves in cats and found that, when the cats were trained to withhold motor movement, they released SMR, or mu, waves, a wave similar to alpha waves.
Using a reward system, he further trained these cats to enter this state more easily.
Later, he was approached by the United States Air Force to test the effects of a jet fuel that was known to cause seizures in humans.
Sterman tested the effects of this fuel on the previously-trained cats, and discovered that they had a higher resistance to seizures than non-trained cats.
Alpha wave biofeedback has gained interest for having some successes in humans for seizure suppression and for treatment of depression.
Alpha waves again gained interest in regards to an engineering approach to the science fiction challenge of psychokinesis, i.e. control of movement of a physical object using energy emanating from a human brain.
In 1988, EEG alpha rhythm was used in a brain–computer interface experiment of control of a movement of a physical object, a robot.
It was the first experiment to demonstrate control of a physical object, a robot, using EEG.
Navel gazing 
Navel-gazing or omphaloskepsis is the contemplation of one's navel as an aid to meditation.
The word derives from the Ancient Greek words (, ) and (, ).
Actual use of the practice as an aid to contemplation of basic principles of the cosmos and human nature is found in the practice of yoga or Hinduism and sometimes in the Eastern Orthodox Church.
In yoga, the navel is the site of the manipura (also called nabhi) chakra, which yogis consider "a powerful chakra of the body".
The monks of Mount Athos, Greece, were described as "Omphalopsychians" by J.G. Millingen, writing in the 1830s, who says they "...pretended or fancied that they experienced celestial joys when gazing on their umbilical region, in converse with the Deity".
However, phrases such as "contemplating one's navel" or "navel-gazing" are frequently used, usually in jocular fashion, to refer to self-absorbed pursuits.
Muraqabah 
Murāqabah (, : "to observe") is an Islamic methodology, whose aim is a transcendental union with God.
Through , a person watches over their heart and soul, to gain insight into one's relation with their creator and their surroundings. is a tradition commonly found in (Sufi orders).
The objective of is to purge one's base characters and develop lofty character in its place.
According to tradition, it is said to have been the practice of Muhammad during his stay in the Cave of Hira before he met Jibreel.
Etymology and meaning.
The word is derived from the base of .
The base has the meaning of guarding and watching over with the expectation of noticing any change, unique qualities or abnormalities of a given thing.
The word is also on verb scale three, which gives a connotation of exaggeration, overexertion, and partnership.
This then implies that the one who is doing is diligent and hardworking with the expectation that someone else is also doing a similar task.
In ancient Arabic, the word referred to one who would watch the night sky.
They would scan the sky in hopes to see the first signs of early stars to begin their journey.
Due to the intense heat and difficult terrain of the Arabian Peninsula, the ability to recognize the constellations and their seasonal divergences was a critical skill.
In the classic poem, "the observer of the night is as vigilant as a fish in search of water".
This etymology can be connected to the modern linguistical and technical meaning of what is understood to be today.
Murāqabah is seen to be of twin perspectives, both with a connotation of persistence and exertion.
According to al-Qushayrī () and al-Jurjānī () murāqabah is for one to be aware that their Lord is perpetually aware of His subordinates.
Not only is the person continuously in a state of mindfulness but they are also cognizant that their Lord is aware as well, creating a reciprocal relation.
Decorum and etiquette.
One of the most significant sentiments of the great philosopher and theologian Al-Ghāzālī () centers around God-consciousness; he propagates that it is the obligation of the creation to be in constant awareness of its Creator.
That is to constantly obey him.
The Creator's eternal knowledge encompasses the ephemeral existence of mortals, from before their conception to the ages after they have passed on.
His Knowledge envelops the external, the internal and the metaphysical.
He is the Lord and Creator, Glorified Be He.
Once one understands this, they must follow a level of etiquette and protocol which are but not limited to: 
The physical benefits of is akin to the benefits of standard meditation.
Metaphysically speaking, the intended result of is to refrain from any actions contrary to what is obligatory, and ultimately maintain one's mindfulness in a state that one's Lord finds them (in state of mindfulness) where He is pleased with them and not one where He is displeased with them.
To continue to progress in one must be consistent for a lengthy period of time to experience the aforementioned benefits.
Although it may prove difficult in the beginning, one may always regain their state of mindfulness after recognizing a change from their initial state.
Stages.
Here are the ( "stages") in which Sufis have broadly categorised their journey of ascension.
The categorization is an arbitrary one, and each level is generally further divided into several sublevels.
During the process of enlightenment, some stages can merge or overlap each other.
"Ghanūd".
This is the starting level of meditation.
A person who starts meditation often enters a somnolent or sleep state ( ).
With the passage of time, the person goes into a state between sleep and wakefulness.
The person can remember seeing something but not specifically what it is.
This topic is well known and practiced among secular scholars of dream interpretation.
"ʾIdrāk".
During ( "cognition"), with continuous practice of meditation, the sleepiness from meditation decreases.
When the conscious mind is not suppressed by sleep and is able to focus, the person can receive the spiritual knowledge from his subconscious mind.
At this stage, the person is unable to see or hear anything but is able to experience or perceive it.
"Wurūd".
During ( "coming, beginning"), when (experience) becomes deep, it is exhibited as sight.
The stage of starts when mental concentration is sustained and somnolence is at its minimum.
As soon as the mind is focused, the spiritual eye is activated.
The conscious mind is not used to see through the spiritual eye so concentration comes and goes.
Gradually, the mind gets used to this kind of visions, and the mental focus is sustained.
With practice, the visions/experience becomes so deep that the person starts considering himself a part of the experience rather than considering himself an observer.
Gnosis of the universe.
"Kashf / ʾilhām".
or ( "unveiling of arcane knowledge" or "intuition") is the stage of starting to get information that most other people are unable to observe.
In the beginning, this occurs suddenly, without personal control.
With practice, the mind gets so energized that it can get this knowledge by will.
"Shuhūd".
With (, "evidence") a person can get any information about any event/person at will.
This stage is broadly categorized according to activation of the senses: 
These are all spiritual senses, known as (senses of the innermost).
"Fatḥ".
With (, "opening, victory") closing eyes is no longer necessary for meditation.
The person is freed from both space and time and can see/hear/taste/touch anything present anywhere in time and space.
Gnosis of Allah.
"Fanāʾ".
During (, "extinction, annihilation"), through a series of stages () and subjective experiences (), this process of absorbation develops until complete annihilation of the self () takes place, and the person becomes , the "perfect man".
It is the disintegration of a person's narrow self-concept, social self and limited intellect (feeling like a drop of water aware of being part of the ocean).
The stage is also called ("extinction with the unity"), and ("extinction in the reality").
"Sair illallah".
During (, "journey towards the God") the person starts his spiritual journey towards the ultimate reality of the universe, God.
It is also called .
"Fana fillah".
(, "extinction of the self in God") is one of the important phases of mystical experience is attained by the grace of God by a traveler on the mystical path.
Now, the person becomes extinct in the will of God.
It is important to mention that this is not incarnation or union.
Most Sufis passing through this experience have preferred to live in the greatest depth of silence, which transcends all forms and sounds and to enjoy their union with the beloved.
"Sair min Allah".
During (, "journey from the God") the person comes back to his existence.
It is also called .
What happens is the person's awareness of God increases so much so that he forgets his own self and is totally lost in his magnificence.
"Baqaa billah".
(, "eternal life in God The Creator") is the state in which man comes back to his existence and God appoints him to guide the humans.
The individual is part of the world but unconcerned about rewards or position in the world.
The doctrine is further explained in Sahih Bukhari, which states that God said:  
There is another verse from Qur'an that is used to explain this concept: 
When Sufis have come out of the state and enter , many of them have produced works of unsurpassed glory, especially in the fields of philosophy, literature and music.
Such works have crowned the culture of the entire Islamic world and inspired Sufis and non-Sufis for generations.
As the great Persian Sufi poet, Hafez of Shiraz, fondly remembered as the "tongue of the unseen", said centuries ago: "He whose heart is alive with love, never dies".
The "Qur'an" says: 
Mu wave 
The sensorimotor mu rhythm, also known as mu wave, comb or wicket rhythms or arciform rhythms, are synchronized patterns of electrical activity involving large numbers of neurons, probably of the pyramidal type, in the part of the brain that controls voluntary movement.
These patterns as measured by electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), or electrocorticography (ECoG), repeat at a frequency of 7.5–12.5 (and primarily 9–11) Hz, and are most prominent when the body is physically at rest.
Unlike the alpha wave, which occurs at a similar frequency over the resting visual cortex at the back of the scalp, the mu rhythm is found over the motor cortex, in a band approximately from ear to ear.
People suppress mu rhythms when they perform motor actions or, with practice, when they visualize performing motor actions.
This suppression is called desynchronization of the wave because EEG wave forms are caused by large numbers of neurons firing in synchrony.
The mu rhythm is even suppressed when one observes another person performing a motor action or an abstract motion with biological characteristics.
Researchers such as V. S. Ramachandran and colleagues have suggested that this is a sign that the mirror neuron system is involved in mu rhythm suppression, although others disagree.
The mu rhythm is of interest to a variety of scholars.
Scientists who study neural development are interested in the details of the development of the mu rhythm in infancy and childhood and its role in learning.
Since a group of researchers believe that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is strongly influenced by an altered mirror neuron system and that mu rhythm suppression is a downstream indication of mirror neuron activity, many of these scientists have kindled a more popular interest in investigating the mu wave in people with ASD.
Assorted investigators are also in the process of using mu rhythms to develop a new technology: the brain–computer interface (BCI).
With the emergence of BCI systems, clinicians hope to give the severely physically disabled population new methods of communication and a means to manipulate and navigate their environments.
Mirror neurons.
The mirror neuron system consists of a class of neurons that was first studied in the 1990s in macaque monkeys.
Studies have found sets of neurons that fire when these monkeys perform simple tasks and also when the monkeys view others performing the same simple tasks.
This suggests they play a role in mapping others' movements into the brain without actually physically performing the movements.
These sets of neurons are called mirror neurons and together make up the mirror neuron system.
Mu waves are suppressed when these neurons fire, a phenomenon which allows researchers to study mirror neuron activity in humans.
There is evidence that mirror neurons exist in humans as well as in non-human animals.
The right fusiform gyrus, left inferior parietal lobule, right anterior parietal cortex, and left inferior frontal gyrus are of particular interest.
Some researchers believe that mu wave suppression can be a consequence of mirror neuron activity throughout the brain, and represents a higher-level integrative processing of mirror neuron activity.
Tests in both monkeys (using invasive measuring techniques) and humans (using EEG and fMRI) have found that these mirror neurons not only fire during basic motor tasks, but also have components that deal with intention.
There is evidence of an important role for mirror neurons in humans, and mu waves may represent a high level coordination of those mirror neurons.
Development.
A fruitful conceptualization of mu waves in pediatric use is that mu wave "suppression" is a representation of activity going on in the world, and is detectable in the frontal and parietal networks.
A resting oscillation becomes suppressed during the observation of sensory information such as sounds or sights, usually within the frontoparietal (motor) cortical region.
The mu wave is detectable during infancy as early as four to six months, when the peak frequency the wave reaches can be as low as 5.4 Hz.
There is a rapid increase in peak frequency in the first year of life, and by age two frequency typically reaches 7.5 Hz.
The peak frequency of the mu wave increases with age until maturation into adulthood, when it reaches its final and stable frequency of 8–13 Hz.
These varying frequencies are measured as activity around the central sulcus, within the Rolandic cortex.
Mu waves are thought to be indicative of an infant’s developing ability to imitate.
This is important because the ability to imitate plays a vital role in the development of motor skills, tool use, and understanding causal information through social interaction.
Mimicking is integral in the development of social skills and understanding nonverbal cues.
Causal relationships can be made through social learning without requiring experience firsthand.
In action execution, mu waves are present in both infants and adults before and after the execution of a motor task and its accompanying desynchronization.
While executing a goal-oriented action, however, infants exhibit a higher degree of desynchronization than do adults.
Just as with an action execution, during action observation infants’ mu waves not only show a desynchronization, but show a desynchronization greater in degree than the one evidenced in adults.
This tendency for changes in degree of desynchronization, rather than actual changes in frequency, becomes the measure for mu wave development throughout adulthood, although the most changes take place during the first year of life.
Understanding the mechanisms that are shared between action perception and execution in the earliest years of life has implications for language development.
Learning and understanding through social interaction comes from imitating movements as well as vowel sounds.
Sharing the experience of attending to an object or event with another person can be a powerful force in the development of language.
Autism.
Autism is a disorder that is associated with social and communicative deficits.
A single cause of autism has yet to be identified, but the mu wave and mirror neuron system have been studied specifically for their role in the disorder.
In a typically developing individual, the mirror neuron system responds when they either watch someone perform a task or perform the task themself.
In individuals with autism, mirror neurons become active (and consequently mu waves are suppressed) only when the individual performs the task themself.
This finding has led some scientists, notably V. S. Ramachandran and colleagues, to view autism as disordered understanding of other individuals' intentions and goals due to problems with the mirror neuron system.
This deficiency would explain the difficulty people with autism have in communicating with and understanding others.
While most studies of the mirror neuron system and mu waves in people with autism have focused on simple motor tasks, some scientists speculate that these tests can be expanded to show that problems with the mirror neuron system underlie overarching cognitive and social deficits.
fMRI activation magnitudes in the inferior frontal gyrus increase with age in people with autism, but not in typically developing individuals.
Furthermore, greater activation was associated with greater amounts of eye contact and better social functioning.
Scientists believe the inferior frontal gyrus is one of the main neural correlates with the mirror neuron system in humans and is often related to deficits associated with autism.
These findings suggest that the mirror neuron system may not be non-functional in individuals with autism, but simply abnormal in its development.
This information is significant to the present discussion because mu waves may be integrating different areas of mirror neuron activity in the brain.
Other studies have assessed attempts to consciously stimulate the mirror neuron system and suppress mu waves using neurofeedback (a type of biofeedback given through computers that analyze real time recordings of brain activity, in this case EEGs of mu waves).
This type of therapy is still in its early phases of implementation for individuals with autism, and has conflicting forecasts for success.
Brain–computer interfaces.
Brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) are a developing technology that clinicians hope will one day bring more independence and agency to the severely physically disabled.
This technology has the potential to help include people with near-total or total paralysis, such as those with tetraplegia (quadriplegia) or advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); BCIs are intended to help them to communicate or even move objects such as motorized wheelchairs, neuroprostheses, or robotic grasping tools.
Few of these technologies are currently in regular use by people with disabilities, but a diverse array are in development at an experimental level.
One type of BCI uses event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the mu wave in order to control the computer.
This method of monitoring brain activity takes advantage of the fact that when a group of neurons is at rest they tend to fire in synchrony with each other.
When a participant is cued to imagine movement (an "event"), the resulting desynchronization (the group of neurons that was firing in synchronous waves now firing in complex and individualized patterns) can be reliably detected and analyzed by a computer.
Users of such an interface are trained in visualizing movements, typically of the foot, hand, and/or tongue, which are each in different locations on the cortical homunculus and thus distinguishable by an electroencephalograph (EEG) or electrocorticograph (ECoG) recording of electrical activity over the motor cortex.
In this method, computers monitor for a typical pattern of mu wave ERD contralateral to the visualized movement combined with event-related synchronization (ERS) in the surrounding tissue.
This paired pattern intensifies with training, and the training increasingly takes the form of games, some of which utilize virtual reality.
Some researchers have found that the feedback from virtual reality games is particularly effective in giving the user tools to improve control of his or her mu wave patterns.
The ERD method can be combined with one or more other methods of monitoring the brain's electrical activity to create hybrid BCIs, which often offer more flexibility than a BCI that uses any single monitoring method.
History.
Mu waves have been studied since the 1930s, and are referred to as the wicket rhythm because the rounded EEG waves resemble croquet wickets.
In 1950, Henri Gastaut and his coworkers reported desynchronization of these waves not only during active movements of their subjects, but also while the subjects observed actions executed by someone else.
These results were later confirmed by additional research groups, including a study using subdural electrode grids in epileptic patients.
The latter study showed mu suppression while the patients observed moving body parts in somatic areas of the cortex that corresponded to the body part moved by the actor.
Further studies have shown that the mu waves can also be desynchronized by imagining actions and by passively viewing point-light biological motion.
Trikona 
Trikona is a Sanskrit word which signifies a triangle and is one of the widely used mythical geometric symbol.
It is used to assist in meditation, and in different yantras.
Different positions of trikona (triangle) are believed to impart different types of properties and attributes to the symbol.
Such properties and attributes include the following: 
It is also used to describe astrological houses located in a triangular relationship to one another in Vedic astrology: the first house, the fifth house and ninth house, which are all 120 degrees from one another.
Jewish meditation 
Jewish meditation includes practices of settling the mind, introspection, visualization, emotional insight, contemplation of divine names, or concentration on philosophical, ethical or mystical ideas.
Meditation may accompany unstructured, personal Jewish prayer, may be part of structured Jewish services, or may be separate from prayer practices.
Jewish mystics have viewed meditation as leading to "devekut" (cleaving to God).
Hebrew terms for meditation include "hitbodedut" (or "hisbodedus," literally "self-seclusion") or "hitbonenut/hisbonenus" ("contemplation").
Through the centuries, meditation practices have been developed in many movements, including among Maimonideans (Moses Maimonides and Abraham Maimonides), Kabbalists (Abraham Abulafia, Isaac the Blind, Azriel of Gerona, Moses Cordovero, Yosef Karo and Isaac Luria), Hasidic rabbis (Baal Shem Tov, Schneur Zalman of Liadi and Nachman of Breslov), Musar movement rabbis (Israel Salanter and Simcha Zissel Ziv), Conservative movement rabbis (Alan Lew), Reform movement rabbis (Lawrence Kushner and Rami Shapiro), and Reconstructionist movement rabbi (Shefa Gold).
Bible.
Aryeh Kaplan sees indications throughout the Hebrew Bible that Judaism always contained a central meditative tradition, going back to the time of the patriarchs.
For instance, in the book of Genesis, the patriarch Isaac is described as going "lasuach" (Hebrew: לָשׂוּחַ "lāśūaḥ", "to meditate") in the field (Genesis 24:63), understood by many commentators to refer to some type of meditative practice.
Merkavah-Heichalot mysticism.
Some scholars see Merkavah-Heichalot mysticism as using meditative methods, built around the biblical vision of Ezekiel and the creation in Genesis.
According to Michael D. Swartz: "the texts do not, however, provide any instructions for meditation techniques.
Nor do they betray any evidence of consciousness of an interior self, such as the soul or mind, which accomplishes the journey to heaven."
Maimonides.
Moses Maimonides, often considered the greatest Jewish philosopher of his time, writes in "The Guide for the Perplexed" (3:51) that those who are "perfect" in their intellectual perception of God can "enjoy the presence 
of Divine Providence", but only while they "meditate on God".
He offers a parable that suggests that purely intellectual, private meditation is the highest form of worship.
Similarly, in (3.32), Maimonides suggests that intellectual meditation is a higher form of worship than either sacrifice or prayer.
Abraham Maimonides, son of Moses Maimonides, also recommended private meditative practices that were designed to rid the mind of desires and allow for communion with God.
Abraham Maimonides developed a Jewish Sufi meditation practice that was influential in medieval Cairo 
Kabbalah.
Kabbalists of different schools have been concerned with a range of esoteric encounters with divinity mediated by different meditative practices, ranging from ecstatic mystical cleaving to God, or prophetic visual and auditory disclosing of the divine, to theurgic manipulation of theosophical divine emanations.
Practices included meditation on the names of God in Judaism, combinations of Hebrew letters, and "kavanot" (esoteric "intentions").
The main concern of the Theosophical Kabbalah such as the "Zohar" and Isaac Luria was on theurgic harmonisation of the sephirot (Divine attributes), though recent phenomenological scholarship has uncovered the prophetic visualisation of the sephirot as a Divine Anthropos in the imagination of the medieval theosophical practitioners.
In contrast, the main concern of the medieval "Ecstatic Kabbalah", exemplified most fully in Abraham Abulafia's "Prophetic Kabbalah", was on unio mystica and drawing down the influx of prophecy upon the practitioner.
Abulafia opposed interpreting the sephirot as theosophical-theurgical hypostases, seeing them in Maimonidean negative theology psychological terms, while viewing his meditation mysticism as a superior Kabbalah.
The ethic of meditation mysticism in Abulafia and other Ecstatic Kabbalists was a minority tradition to the Theosophical Kabbalah mainstream, but later aspects of it became incorporated in the 16th century Theosophical compendiums of Cordovero and Vital, such as drawing down divine influx, and subsequently influenced the psychologisation of Kabbalah in Hasidic self-absorption in God.
Ecstatic traditions were at a disadvantage for normative Judaism, as they made classic meditation their central preoccupation; as with Moses Maimonides the mitzvot (Jewish observances) were a means to the end purpose of mystical or philosophical cleaving to God (or the Active intellect).
In contrast, Theosophical traditions centred around the theurgic power and cosmic centrality importance of normative Jewish worship and Halakha observance, especially when carried out with elite Kavanot (mystical intentions).
Pinchas Giller questions the usage of the term "meditation" for Theosophical (mainstream) Kabbalah's theurgic kavanot (intentions), where deveikut (cleaving to God) was secondary, preferring the term more accurately for Ecstatic Kabbalah's unio mystica methods and goal.
He sees generalising the term in reference to all Kabbalistic intentions as a reflection of the contemporary zeitgeist, promoted by Aryeh Kaplan and others.
He recommends Ecstatic Kabbalah, the Jewish Sufism of Abraham Maimonides, or Chabad Hasidic prayer contemplation as paths more suited to develop a future ethic of Jewish meditation (unio mystica).
However, as mitzvot are the primary centre of traditional Judaism, Giller sees Jewish prayer, rather than classic meditation akin to Eastern Religions, as the true central expression of Judaism.
Theosophical Kabbalists and later Hasidism were deeply concerned to develop mystical approaches to prayer, whether theurgic in the case of Kabbalah, or devotional and self-nullifying in the case of Hasidism.
In contrast to rationalist Jewish philosophy's progressively anti-metaphysical interpretation of Jewish observance, Theosophical Kabbalists reinterpreted Judaism's prayer and mitzvot as cosmic metaphysical processes, especially when carried out in particular ways that could channel the mystical flow between the Divine sephirot on high and from the divine realm to this world.
They reinterpreted standard Jewish liturgy by reading it as esoteric mystical meditations and the ascent of the soul for elite practitioners.
Through this, the border between supplicatory prayer and theurgic practice blurs if prayer becomes viewed as a magical process rather than Divine response to petitions.
However, Kabbalists censored directly magical Practical Kabbalah willed control of angels for only the most holy, and justified their theurgic prayer as optimising the divine channels through which their prayerful supplication to God ascends.
Kabbalists declare one prayers only "to Him (God's essence, "male" here solely in Hebrew's gendered grammar), not to His attributes (sephirot)".
To pray to a Divine attribute introduces the cardinal idolatrous sin of division and plurality among the sephirot, separating them from their dependence and nullification in the Absolute Ein Sof Unity.
Instead, Kabbalist prayer, following the liturgy, is only to God ("Blessed are You, Lord our God" - the Divine Essence expressed though different Names of God in Judaism).
However, each traditional Name of God corresponds in Kabbalah to a different manifestation of the sephirot.
Moses Cordovero, who systemised Kabbalah, explains that the sephirot names (Keter, Chokhmah, Binah, etc.) are the vessels of each attribute; to pray to the vessel is idolatry.
The corresponding Names of God (Eheye, Yah, Havayah, etc) relate to the inner Divine Unity dimension of each sephira, expressing the forms the unified Infinite light takes as it illuminates within each vessel; prayer to traditional liturgy Divine Names is prayer to God's Essence, expressed through particular sephirot supernal channels on high.
Corresponding with the traditional words of prayer, the Kabbalist intentionally contemplates each Divine Name sephirot channel with theurgic Kavanot meditations to open the Divine flow so prayer supplication to God's hidden innermost Will (concealed within the innermost dimensions of the first sephirah Keter, where it merges into the Ein Sof) is optimised, as the traditional prayer relates, "May it be Your Will that... your Kindness overrides Judgment" etc. 
Aryeh Kaplan described what he termed "meditative kabbalah", shared across academic divisions between Theosophical and Ecstatic Kabbalists, as a midpoint on the spectrum between "practical kabbalah" and "theoretical kabbalah".
Ecstatic Kabbalists.
Abraham Abulafia.
Abraham Abulafia (1240–1291), a leading medieval figure in the history of Meditative Kabbalah and the founder of the school of Prophetic/Ecstatic Kabbalah, wrote meditation manuals using meditation on Hebrew letters and words to achieve ecstatic states.
His teachings embody the non-Zoharic stream in Spanish Kabbalism, which he viewed as alternative and superior to the theosophical Kabbalah which he criticised.
Abulafia's work is surrounded in controversy because of the edict against him by Shlomo ben Aderet, a contemporary leading scholar.
However, according to Aryeh Kaplan, the Abulafian system of meditations forms an important part of the work of Hayim Vital, and in turn his master Isaac Luria.
Aryeh Kaplan's pioneering translations and scholarship on Meditative Kabbalah trace Abulafia's publications to the extant concealed transmission of the esoteric meditative methods of the Hebrew prophets.
While Abulafia remained a marginal figure in the direct development of Theosophical Kabbalah, recent academic scholarship on Abulafia by Moshe Idel reveals his wider influence across the later development of Jewish mysticism.
In the 16th century Judah Albotini continued Abulafian methods in Jerusalem.
Isaac of Acco.
Isaac ben Samuel of Acre (1250-1340) also wrote about meditative techniques.
One of Isaac's most important teachings involves developing "hishtavut", which Aryeh Kaplan describes as equanimity, stoicism, and a total indifference to outside influences.
Rabbi Isaac sees "hishtavut" as a prerequisite for meditation.
Joseph Tzayach.
Joseph Tzayach (1505-1573), influenced by Abulafia, taught his own system of meditation.
Tzayach was probably the last Kabbalist to advocate use of the prophetic position, where one places his head between his knees.
This position was used by Elijah on Mount Carmel, and in early Merkabah mysticism.
Speaking of individuals who meditate (hitboded), he says: 
They bend themselves like reeds, placing their heads between their knees until all their faculties are nullified.
As a result of this lack of sensation, they see the Supernal Light, with true vision and not with allegory.
Theosophical Kabbalists.
Moses ben Jacob Cordovero.
Moses ben Jacob Cordovero (1522-1570) taught that when meditating, one does not focus on the Sefirot (divine emanations) per se, but rather on the light from the Infinite ("Atzmus"-essence of God) contained within the emanations.
Keeping in mind that all reaches up to the Infinite, his prayer is "to Him, not to His attributes."
Proper meditation focuses upon how the Godhead acts through specific sefirot.
In meditation on the essential Hebrew name of God, represented by the four letter Tetragrammaton, this corresponds to meditating on the Hebrew vowels which are seen as reflecting the light from the Infinite-Atzmus.
Isaac Luria.
Isaac Luria (1534–1572), the father of modern Kabbalah, systemised Lurianic Kabbalistic theory as a dynamic mythological scheme.
While the Zohar is outwardly solely a theosophical work, for which reason medieval Meditative Kabbalists followed alternative traditions, Luria's systemisation of doctrine enabled him to draw new detailed meditative practices, called "Yichudim", from the Zohar, based on the dynamic interaction of the Lurianic "partzufim".
This meditative method, as with Luria's theosophical exegesis, dominated later Kabbalistic activity.
Luria prescribed "Yichudim" as "Kavanot" for the prayer liturgy, later practiced communally by Shalom Sharabi and the Beit El circle, for Jewish observances, and for secluded attainment of "Ruach Hakodesh".
One favoured activity of the Safed mystics was meditation while prostrated on the graves of saints, in order to commune with their souls.
Hayim Vital.
Haim Vital (c. 1543-1620), major disciple of Isaac Luria, and responsible for publication of most of his works.
In Etz Hayim and the Eight Gates he describes the theosophical and meditative teachings of Luria.
However, his own writings cover wider meditative methods, drawn from earlier sources.
His "Shaarei Kedusha" (Gates of Holiness) was the only guidebook to Meditative Kabbalah traditionally printed, though its most esoteric fourth part remained unpublished until recently.
In the following account Vital presents the method of R. Yosef Karo in receiving his Heavenly Magid teacher, which he regarded as the soul of the Mishna (recorded by Karo in Magid Mesharim): 
Meditate alone in a house, wrapped in a prayer shawl.
Sit and shut your eyes, and transcend the physical as if your soul has left your body and is ascending to heaven.
After this divestment/ascension, recite one Mishna, any Mishna you wish, many times consecutively, as quickly as you can, with clear pronunciation, without skipping one word.
Intend to bind your soul with the soul of the sage who taught this Mishna.
" Your soul will become a chariot. .."
Do this by intending that your mouth is a mere vessel/conduit to bring forth the letters of the words of this Mishna, and that the voice that emerges through the vessel of your mouth is [filled with] the sparks of your inner soul which are emerging and reciting this Mishna.
In this way, your soul will become a chariot within which the soul of the sage who is the master of that Mishna can manifest.
His soul will then clothe itself within your soul.
At a certain point in the process of reciting the words of the Mishna, you may feel overcome by exhaustion.
If you are worthy, the soul of this sage may then come to reside in your mouth.
This will happen in the midst of your reciting the Mishna.
As you recite, he will begin to speak with your mouth and wish you Shalom.
He will then answer every question that comes into your thoughts to ask him.
He will do this with and through your mouth.
Your ears will hear his words, for you will not be speaking from yourself.
Rather, he will be speaking through you.
This is the mystery of the verse, "The spirit of God spoke to me, and His word was on my lips".
(Samuel II 23:2) 
Hasidism.
The Baal Shem Tov.
The Baal Shem Tov, founder of Hasidic Judaism, took the Talmudic phrase that "God desires the heart" and made it central to his love of the sincerity of the common folk.
Advocating joy in the omnipresent divine immanence, he encouraged emotional "devekut" (fervour), especially through attachment to the Hasidic figure of the Tzaddik.
He also encouraged his close disciples to find "devekut" through seclusion ("hisbodedus") from others and by meditating on select kabbalistic unifications ("yichudim") of Yitzchak Luria.
As Hasidism developed and became a popular revival movement, use of esoteric Kabbalistic Kavanot (intentions) on Divine names was seen as an impediment to direct emotional Devekut (cleaving to God), and was dropped in favour of new meditative and contemplative practices of Divine consciousness.
This downplaying of the theurgic role of Theosophical Kabbalah, the psychologisation of Kabbalistic symbolism, and emphasis on Divine Omnipresence, began with the Baal Shem Tov.
In a parable he related that knowing each of the detailed Kabbalistic Kavanot in prayer unlocked individual gates in Heaven, but tears break through all barriers to reach the King Himself.
Chabad Hasidism.
Dovber Schneuri, the second leader of the Chabad Dynasty, wrote several works explaining the Chabad approach.
In his works, he explains that the Hebrew word for meditation is "hisbonenus" (alternatively transliterated as "hitbonenut").
The word "hisbonenut" derives from the Hebrew word "Binah" (lit. understanding) and refers to the process of understanding through analytical study.
While the word "hisbonenus" can be applied to analytical study of any topic, it is generally used to refer to study of the Torah, and particularly in this context, the explanations of Kabbalah in Chabad Hasidic philosophy, in order to achieve a greater understanding and appreciation of God.
In the Chabad presentation, every intellectual process must incorporate three faculties: "Chochma", "Binah", and "Daat".
"Chochma" (lit. wisdom) is the mind's ability to come up with a new insight into a concept that one did not know before.
"Binah" (lit. understanding) is the mind's ability to take a new insight (from "Chochma"), analyze all of its implications and simplify the concept so it is understood well.
"Daat" (lit. knowledge), the third stage, is the mind's ability to focus and hold its attention on the "Chochma" and the "Binah".
The term "hisbonenus" represents an important point of the Chabad method: Chabad Hasidic philosophy rejects the notion that any new insight can come from mere concentration.
Chabad philosophy explains that while "Daat" is a necessary component of cognition, it is like an empty vessel without the learning and analysis and study that comes through the faculty of "Binah".
Just as a scientist's new insight or discovery ("Chochma") always results from prior in-depth study and analysis of his topic ("Binah"), likewise, to gain any insight in godliness can only come through in-depth study of the explanations of Kabbalah and Hasidic philosophy.
In this view, enlightenment is commensurate with one's understanding of the Torah and specifically the explanations of Kabbalah and Hasidic philosophy.
Prolonged concentration devoid of intellectual content, or hallucinations of the imagination, should not be mistaken for spiritual enlightenment.
Chabad accepts and endorses the writings of Kabbalists such as Moses Cordovero and Haim Vital and their works are quoted at length in the Hasidic texts.
However, the Chabad masters say that their methods are easily misunderstood without a proper foundation in Hasidic philosophy.
Breslav Hasidism.
Rebbe Nachman of Breslov used the term "hisbodedus" (alternatively transliterated as "hitbodedut", from the root "boded" meaning "self-seclusion") to refer to an unstructured, spontaneous and individualized form of prayer and meditation.
It may involve speaking to God in one's own words, although Rebbe Nachman teaches that if one does not know what to say, one should repeat the words "Ribbono Shel Olam," which will create a heightened state of awareness.
The goals of "hitbodedut" may include establishing a close, personal relationship with God and a clearer understanding of one's personal motives and goals or (as in Likutey Moharan I, Lesson 52) the transformative realization of God as the "Imperative Existent," or Essence of Reality.
The Musar Movement.
The Musar (ethics) movement, founded by Rabbi Israel Salanter in the middle of the 19th century, encouraged meditative practices of introspection and visualization that could help to improve moral character.
Focusing on the truthful psychological self-evaluation of one's spiritual worship, the Musar movement institutionalized the classic musar literature tradition as a spiritual movement within the Lithuanian Yeshiva academies.
Many meditation techniques were described in the writings of Salanter's closest disciple, Rabbi Simcha Zissel Ziv.
According to Geoffrey Claussen of Elon University, some forms of Musar meditation are visualization techniques which "seek to make impressions upon one's character—often a matter of taking insights of which we are conscious and bringing them into our unconscious."
Other forms of Musar meditation are introspective, "considering one's character and exploring its tendencies—often a matter of taking what is unconscious and bringing it to consciousness."
A number of contemporary rabbis have advocated such practices, including "taking time each day to sit in silence and simply noticing the way that one's mind wanders."
Alan Morinis, the founder of the Mussar Institute, recommends morning meditation practices that can be as short as four minutes.
One of the meditations especially recommended by Morinis is the practice of focusing on a single word: the Hebrew word "Sh'ma," meaning "listen."
Orthodox Judaism.
Recent Orthodox Judaism teachers of Jewish mystical meditation methods include Aryeh Kaplan and Yitzchak Ginsburgh.
Kaplan especially, published scholarly and popular books that reinterpreted and revived historic Jewish mystical contemplation techniques in terms of the late 20th century zeitgeist for meditation.
Conservative Judaism.
Conservative Rabbi Alan Lew has been credited with teaching Jewish meditation to thousands of people.
His synagogue Congregation Beth Sholom in San Francisco, California, includes a meditation center, the first meditation center connected to a Conservative synagogue.
By 1997, Lew noted that almost all of the largest Conservative synagogues in northern California had regular meditation groups.
Conservative rabbi Geoffrey Claussen has encouraged Conservative Judaism to adopt meditation practices from the Musar movement.
Conservative synagogues that promote meditation practices in the 21st century sometimes describe these practices as helping people to create space in their lives to be present.
Reconstructionist Judaism.
Reconstructionist rabbis such as Sheila Peltz Weinberg and Shefa Gold have been noted for their Jewish meditation teachings.
Reform Judaism.
Meditation activities have become increasingly common at Reform synagogues in the twenty-first century.
Rabbis Lawrence Kushner and Rami Shapiro are among the Reform rabbis who encourage Jewish meditation practices.
Zhong Gong 
Zhong Gong (中功) is a spiritual movement based on "qigong" founded in 1987 by Zhang Hongbao.
The full name (中华养生益智功) translates to "China Health Care and Wisdom Enhancement Practice."
The system distinguished itself from other forms of "qigong" by its strong emphasis on commercialisation, and a targeted strategy that aimed to build a national commercial organisation in China in the 1990s.
Zhong Gong achieved national prominence during the 'qigong fever' that gripped China during the Deng Xiaoping era.
The denomination included a nationwide network of schools and healing centres based on Zhang's form of "qigong" before being outlawed by Chinese authorities in 1999.
Zhang Hongbao claimed in 2003 to have about 38 million followers, and even Jiang Zemin allegedly believed in the curative power of Zhong Gong's message.
After China declared Zhong Gong an illegal organisation, all its assets and those of the 3,000 entitles constituting the Unicorn Group were confiscated, its 600 principals arrested.
Zhong Gong wilted away once the organisation was no longer able to transmit the material and social benefits which were motivational drivers for its followers.
After a warrant for the arrest of leader Zhang Hongbao was issued, he fled to the United States and applied for political asylum—he gained Protective resident status in U.S. on 13 June 2001.
Zhang died in a car accident in July 2006.
History and development.
In the aftermath of the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations, Zhang Hongbao retreated to a remote base area in Sichuan, where he reorganised his followers as employees of a web of private enterprises owned by a parent firm, the Qilin Group.
During the early 1990s, Zhong Gong became the most popular of the various "qigong" schools, but rumours concerning Zhong Gong started to surface.
As controversy about Zhong Gong increased, Falun Gong gained in popularity, eventually superseding Zhong Gong as the largest movement of its kind.
Its commercial activities were incorporated in China as the Unicorn Group (麒麟集团), a collectively ownership enterprise.
In Mainland China, it had numerous operations, branches, and staff.
There were six subordinate divisions, including Qigong training, healthy living, travel, education, medical.
Political scientist Patricia M. Thornton at the University of Oxford lists Zhong Gong as an example of a cybersect, due to the group's reliance internet for text distribution, recruitment and information-sharing among adherents.
Beliefs and teachings.
Palmer, citing Ji Yi, said Zhang developed a style of "Qigong" which was based on automation, physics, relativity, bionics, and with distinctive use of mechanical engineering jargon, and founded Zhong Gong in 1987, launching it on the auspicious date of 8 August 1987.
Zhong Gong is based on the "qilin culture" (麒麟文化), created by Zhang in 1987 which, as he claimed in 2000, is "an obvious challenge to Marxism and the CCP's one-party rule".
According to Zhang's 'spirit-matter dialectics', both spirit and matter have objective existence and can transform into the other under certain circumstances.
In 1992, based on the ancient theories of yin and yang, Zhang extrapolated his universal law of motion according to which all objects or matter can subdivide into 'Yin' or 'Yang', predicting anything or act which contravened it would bring eventual disaster.
He asserted Marxist property right theory and the derived Communist Party aim to eliminate private property were in conflict with his laws.
In 1993, Zhang advanced his theories of 'promotion-restriction-inhibition-transformation' derived from the Five elements.
In 1998, Zhang put forward a moral code which he referred to as "eight virtues and eight calls".
Qilin culture.
'Qilin Culture' philosophy was developed by Zhang Hongbao, the master of Zhong Gong, and proclaimed during public lectures in Beijing.
According to a well-known account by Ji Yi, a journalist and enthusiastic "qigong" practitioner himself, "the qilin combines in a single body the essence of different species of living beings: the dragon's head, the pig's nose, the serpent's scales, the deer's body, the tiger's back, the bear's thighs, the ox's hooves and the lion's tail."
Qilin culture, according to Zhang, was made up of eight "systems": a philosophical system based on the traditional "diagram of ultimate return," which is to explain the origin of all creatures, their functions, and final destinations; a system of life sciences based on the use of "qi" to penetrate the mystery of biological systems; a system of "special medicine," which was different in important ways from Chinese and Western medicine, and "even garden variety qigong"; a system of art and aesthetics included "qigong" art, architecture, dance, music; a system of education; a system of industrial and political management; a system of everyday behaviour; a system of body practices.
Organisational techniques.
Zhang Hongbao's had two organisations which formed the foundation of what eventually became an "impressive set of interlocked enterprises, the engine of which was a Qigong practice" according to Patricia Thornton.
More than any other "qigong" group, Zhong Gong concerned itself with a systematic training scheme of eight ascending levels.
The practitioner would thus have a clear path of progression on which to advance.
Unlike other "qigong" schools, which emphasised mastery of sitting meditation, movements, and inner alchemy, Zhong Gong geared its workshops around the acquisition of specific skills.
The participants were to master a skill with satisfaction after several days training.
Workshops aimed to train participants in Zhong Gong's brand of organisational and managerial techniques at the "second level."
They would then be able to go forth and set up their own Zhong Gong franchises.
Stage one included basic techniques and posters; stage two covered organisational methods, certain "qigong" performance arts, and the 'secret of secrets' of Buddhist and Taoist techniques; stage three consisted of still meditation ("jinggong"), "qigong" hypnosis, and spontaneous boxing; stage four included more advanced "qigong" techniques like electric "qigong", hard "qigong" etc., while stage five covered Fengshui, massage, regulation of the emotions, and more.
The sixth, seventh, and eighth levels were never disclosed to the public.
Zhong Gong drew a large number of staunch believers across China, elaborating a highly organised structure that led Chinese Communist Party authorities to suspect it may turn into an opposing political force.
Qilin Culture's modern management theory, based on the traditional yin—yang and five-elements cosmology, was the basis for the Zhong Gong organisation, according to Palmer.
It was claimed to be applicable to family, business or government, and aimed to synthesise the best aspects of the five phases of human social development: primitive society, slave society, feudal society, capitalist society and communist society.
Banned in China.
The 12th session of the NPC Standing Committee passed a resolution on 30 October 1999 which allowed it to take action against "heretic cults" and which applied retroactively to Falun Gong, Zhong Gong and any other spiritual groups deemed "dangerous to the state".
However, Zhong Gong has been much more low key than Falun Gong, and the government crackdown on it is almost unknown in China.
Palmer describes how Zhong Gong effectively ceased to exist once the organisation was no longer able to provide material and social benefits to its followers.
As a sign of Zhang's acumen, Thornton notes that when the Beijing daily reported that his Beijing-based International Qigong Service Enterprise had been shut down pending an investigation into possible criminal activities, Zhang hired the team of lawyers who had defended Mao's widow during the Gang of Four trial, and managed to gain a public apology from the paper.
A five-year string of unsuccessful legal actions against the government followed, during which Zhang managed to elude arrest.
After China declared Zhong Gong an illegal organisation, all its assets and those of the 3,000 entities constituting the Unicorn Group were confiscated, and its 600 principals arrested.
After a warrant for the arrest of leader Zhang Hongbao was issued, he fled to the United States and applied for political asylum.
He was not granted asylum, but gained Protective Resident Status on 13 June 2001.
Zhang died in the United States in a motor accident on 31 July 2006 at the age of 52.
After Zhang's death, Zhong Gong almost disappeared from the public's eye.
Neigong 
Neigong, also spelled "nei kung", "neigung", or "nae gong", refers to any of a set of Chinese breathing, meditation, somatics practices, and spiritual practice disciplines associated with Daoism and especially the Chinese martial arts.
Neigong practice is normally associated with the so-called "soft style", "internal" or neijia Chinese martial arts, as opposed to the category known as waigong or "external skill" which is historically associated with shaolinquan or the so-called "hard style", "external" or wàijiā Chinese martial arts.
Both have many different schools, disciplines and practices and historically there has been mutual influence between the two and distinguishing precisely between them differs from school to school.
There is both martial and non-martial neigong.
Well-known examples of martial neigong are the various breathing and focus trainings taught in some traditional Taijiquan, Baguazhang, Xingyiquan and Liuhebafa schools.
An example of non-martial neigong is the discipline known as Daoyin.
Internal martial arts.
The martial art school of neigong emphasises training the coordination of the individual's body with the breath, known as "the harmonisation of the inner and outer energy ()", creating a basis for a particular school's method of utilising power and technique.
Neigong exercises that are part of the neijia tradition involve cultivating physical stillness and or conscious (deliberate) movement, designed to produce relaxation or releasing of muscular tension combined with special breathing techniques such as the "tortoise" or "reverse" methods.
The fundamental purpose of this process is to develop a high level of coordination, concentration and technical skill that is known in the martial arts world as neijin ().
The ultimate purpose of this practice is for the individual to become at one with heaven or the Dao ().
As Zhuangzi stated, "Heaven, earth and I are born of one, and I am at one with all that exists ()".
Martial nei gung is about developing internal power.
One way to possibly achieve this is to train particular exercises regularly where the breath is matched with movements of blood or to effect the movement of blood throughout the body.
Through these exercises it can be possible to move the blood to a particular area during a particular movement to have a particular result.
One of the benefits of martial nei gung exercises is the relaxation of blood vessels, nerves, muscles and sinews to help the body move more freely.
With the body moving freely and an excess of blood moving to a particular area with little or no effort, the practitioner can possibly develop many benefits.
These benefits may include: 
It is important to understand that anyone looking to learn nei gung sincerely, is more likely to learn it from a good teacher of internal martial arts like Hsing-Yi (one of the easiest and most powerful forms of martial cultivation).
It is rare to learn authentic Daoist practices from a true master of the subject as quite a lot of the nei gung skills are an essential part of a complete system of martial arts.
Nei gung is not a philosophy, but a technique and an art of inner cultivation.
There are intellectual guidelines to the practice of nei gung, but it is "Inner Work" which means effort has to be put in to develop real, substantial and testable skills.
This is not something that can be imagined or talked about, only from direct experience and hard effort can an understanding of nei gung develop.
Meditation.
This type of practice is said to require concentration and internal reflection which results in a heightened self-awareness that increases over time with continued practice.
Neigong practitioners report awareness of the mechanics of their blood circulation, peristalsis, muscular movement, skeletal alignment, balance, etc.  
What is said to be occurring as the result of continual practice is a type of internal alchemy, that is a refinement and transmutation of the "Three Treasures" or "San Bao" (), in Chinese.
The Three Treasures are known as Jing (), Qi () and Shen () and can be loosely translated as Essence, Vitality and Spirit.
According to Daoist doctrine the Three Treasures can be described as three types of energy available to humans.
The Dao De Jing purported to be written by Lao zi states in chapter 42 that "The Dao () gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two (Taiji () or Yin and Yang ()) and the Two gives birth to the Three (which some interpret to mean Jing , Qi and Shen , or sometimes Heaven Tian , Earth Di and Man Ren ) and Three gives birth to the Four direction's, North, South, East, and West and so on to the 10,000 Things (Wanwu ); which is all that exists between heaven and earth.
Dao De Jing 道德經, chapter 42, 道生一，一生二，二生三， 三生萬物.
Dao produces one, one produces two, two produces three, three produces 10 Thousand Things (which represents, everything).
萬物負陰而抱陽，沖氣以為和。
All things carry the dark (yin) and embrace the light (yang), and make them harmonize with empty energy.(老子道德經， 吳怡著)The Book of Lao Tzu [The Tao Te Ching]by Yi Wu, 1989, Great Learning Publishing Company.
Laozi (老子) did not say what one, two, or three are.
Take a look at chapter two of the Dao De Jing.
This gives a hint at what one and two might be.
"When all in the world know beauty as beauty, then ugliness has already arisen."
Commentary: Dao 道, is unmanifested, therefore unknowable.
But once a thing (one) comes into existence, then its opposite (two) automatically comes into existence.
Three is the dynamic exchange between the two.
To begin to understand the dynamic between two things, read the YiJing 易經.
The book of changes also known as the I Ching deals with the dynamic exchange between any two things.
Neigong training follows therefore the classical Daoist developmental stages and regards the first two stages as a preparation for the last and final stage: 
"Essence (Jing) → Qi → Spirit (Shen)" 
In popular culture.
Wuxia and xianxia fiction often portray the training of neigong as giving practitioners superhuman powers.
For example, one may use qi to attack opponents without physical contact, fly with qinggong, or harden the body to resist weapon attacks.
These can be seen in novels by Jin Yong and Gu Long, films such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle, as well as video games such as The Legend of Sword and Fairy and Xuan-Yuan Sword.
Pranava yoga 
Pranava yoga is meditation on the sacred mantra Om, as outlined in the Upanishads, the "Bhagavad Gita", and the "Yoga Sutras of Patanjali".
It is also called "Aum yoga" and "Aum yoga meditation".
It is, simply put, fixing the mind on the sound of the mantra "Aum" – the sacred syllable that both symbolizes and embodies Brahman, the Absolute Reality – as the mantra is constantly repeated in unison with the breath.
The purpose of pranava yoga is to become free from suffering and limitation.
The purpose is well stated in the Upanishads:  
The mantra Aum.
Aum, according to Hindu philosophy, is the primordial sound from which the whole universe was created.
Aum, also called the Pranava, is the original Word of Power, and is recited as a mantra.
A mantra is a series of verbal sounds having inherent sound-power that can produce a particular physical or psychological effect, not just something that has an assigned intellectual meaning.
The word mantra derives from the Sanskrit expression mananaath thraayathe which loosely means "a transforming thought"; literally, "that which, when thought, carries one across [the worldly ocean of sorrow]".
The power of a mantra lies in its ability to produce an objective, perceptible change in the yogi who repeats it correctly.
In the yoga tradition, Aum is the most sacred of holy words, the supreme mantra.
Aum is also called the Pranava, a Sanskrit word which means both controller of life force (prana) and life-giver (infuser of prana).
"That which causes all the pranas to prostrate themselves before and get merged in the Paramatman, so as to attain identity with Him, is for that reason known as the Pranava."
– Atharvashikha Upanishad 1:10a.
Aum is called the Shabda Brahman – God as Sound/Vibration.
According to yoga theory, the universe has emanated from this primal movement in God.
By following the thread of Aum back in meditation to more and more subtle levels of awareness, the yogi regains union with Brahman.
The Upanishads.
The Upanishads (both the major and minor) are full of references to Aum and meditation on Aum.
Below is a small sampling: 
"Bhagavad Gita".
Speaking from the perspective of the Infinite Being, enumerating his major manifestation-embodiments, Krishna says: "I am the syllable Om."(Gita 7:8) He also says the same thing in 9:17 ("I am...the sacred monosyllable") and 10:25 ("Among words I am the monosyllable Om").
What to "do" with aum is then outlined by Krishna: "Engaged in the practice of concentration... uttering the monosyllable Om--the Brahman--remembering Me always, he...attains to the supreme goal.
I am easily attainable by that ever-steadfast Yogi who constantly and daily remembers Me."– "Bhagavad Gita" 6:13; 8:12-14 
"Yoga Sutras of Patanjali".
Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, the most ancient and authoritative text on Yoga, outlines the purpose and process of yoga as follows: 
"Ishwara [God] is a particular Purusha [Spirit, Person] Who is untouched by the afflictions of life, actions, and the results and impressions produced by these actions.
In Him is the highest limit of omniscience. 36 Being unconditioned by time He is teacher even of the ancients.
His designator [vachaka] is the Pranava [Om]. 37 Its japa [constant repetition] and bhavanam is the way [or: should be done].
From it result [come] the disappearance of obstacles and the turning inward of consciousness.
Disease, languor, doubt, carelessness, laziness, worldly-mindedness, delusion, non-achievement of a stage, instability, these cause the distraction of the mind and they are the obstacles.
[Mental] pain, despair, nervousness, and agitation are the symptoms of a distracted condition of mind.
For removing these obstacles [there should be] the constant practice of the one principle [the japa and bhavanam of Om]."
– "Yoga Sutras of Patanjali" 1:24-32 
Aum meditation in Kriya Yoga.
Aum meditation is part of Kriya Yoga teachings.
In addition to chanting the sound of aum, this meditation involves inhaling and exhaling while chanting aum in a very specific mudra.
Opinions on Aum.
"[Remembrance of the Pranava] must become so automatic that you cannot breathe without remembering It." 
"Om is the root of all sounds.
Every other sound is contained in That, and It is used to take one beyond all sound."
"OM is the mantra, the expressive sound-symbol of the Brahman Consciousness in its four domains from the Turiya to the external or material plane.
The function of a mantra is to create vibrations in the inner consciousness that will prepare it for the realisation of what the mantra symbolises and is supposed indeed to carry within itself.
The mantra OM should therefore lead towards the opening of the consciousness to the sight and feeling of the One Consciousness in all material things, in the inner being and in the supraphysical worlds, in the causal plane above now superconscient to us and, finally, the supreme liberated transcendence above all cosmic existence.
The last is usually the main preoccupation with those who use the mantra."
"Letters on Yoga", Vol. II, p. 745-46 
"If you are a serious student of Vedic mantras, you will chant Om because Vedic mantras begin with Om.
Om, or the Omkara, is Krishna.
Many people are fond of chanting Omkara.
That is also nice, because Omkara is Krishna.
If we simply remember, This Omkara is Krishna then we become perfect, because the goal is to become Krishna conscious.
So you can become Krishna conscious while chanting Om."
"Om is the highest Name of God, and comprises many other Names of God.
It should be borne in mind that Om is the Name of God exclusively—and of no other object material or spiritual—while the others are but descriptive titles and not exactly proper names."
"This is the Ultimate Word: but can any express its marvellous savor?
He who has savored it once, he knows what joy it can give.
Kabir says: Knowing it, the ignorant man becomes wise, and the wise man becomes speechless and silent."
"Constant japa of the Pranava, Omkar, Which is self-revealing, and constant focus on It as the form of Ishvara, and dedicating all actions to It as if you are not the doer yourself; is Kriya Yoga."
"Following the path of discrimination, let the pure mind be firmly fixed in Om."
"'What will you gain', some sages ask, 'by merely hearing this sound?'
You hear the roar of the ocean from a distance.
By following the roar you can reach the ocean.
As long as there is the roar, there must also be the ocean.
By following the trail of Om you attain Brahman, of which the Word is the symbol.
That Brahman has been described by the Vedas as the ultimate goal."
"The purport of prescribing meditation on the Pranava is this.
The Pranava is Omkara…the advaita-mantra which is the essence of all mantras….
In order to get at this true significance, one should meditate on the Pranava. …
The fruition of this process is samadhi which yields release [moksha], which is the state of unsurpassable bliss."
In the book "Om Chanting and Meditation": 
Seder hishtalshelus 
In Kabbalistic and Hasidic philosophy, seder hishtalshelut or hishtalshelut () refers to the chain-like descent of spiritual worlds ("Olam/Olamot") between God and Creation.
Each spiritual world denotes a complete realm of existence, resulting from its general proximity or distance to divine revelation.
Each realm is also a form of consciousness reflected in this world through the psychology of the soul.
The theosophical tradition in Kabbalah is concerned with defining in great detail the esoteric nature, particular divine manifestations, and functional role of each level between the infinite and the finite.
Each spiritual realm embodies a creative stage God continually uses to go from his self to the creation of the physical world, the material Universe being the end of the chain, and the only physical realm.
Hasidic thought applies the Kabbalistic scheme to its own concern of perceiving divine omnipresence in this material world.
In this, Hasidism varies in its use of Kabbalah, Mainstream-Hasidism avoiding Kabbalistic focus, while Chabad thought explains "seder hishtalshelus" in relation to man's psychology.
In contrast to the functional aim of Kabbalah, this contemplates "seder hishtalshelus" as a vehicle for relating to the divine unity with creation.
The term "Seder Hishtalshelus" is sometimes used restrictively to refer to the actually emergent Created Order (the comprehensive Four Worlds).
More broadly, all preceding levels are included, as their function underlies resulting Existence.
This page lists and links to all the main spiritual levels described in Lurianic Kabbalah, the scheme of Isaac Luria (1534–1572), the basis of modern Jewish mysticism.
Its listing incorporated, expanded and explained earlier Medieval/Classical Kabbalah.
After Luria, esoteric Kabbalists broadened explanation within the Lurianic listing.
The supra-rational doctrines of Luria described Chokhmah (wisdom) levels of Divinity (Tzimtzum, Shevira) that preceded the "rationally" perceived Binah (understanding) levels of Medieval Kabbalah and Moshe Cordovero.
In turn, the Habad Hasidic exploration described Keter (will) levels of Divine intention that preceded Creation.
Etymology.
"Seder hishtalshelus" (Hebrew: ) means the "order of development" or "order of evolution", where the word "Hishtalshelus" (or "Hishtalshelut") is derived from the reduplicated quadriliteral root ŠLŠL "to chain", and so literally means "the chain-like process" ou "graus/níveis/degrais de desdobramento/desabrochamento".
The Upper Unity.
Ohr Ein Sof.
Preparatory stages in the "Ohr Ein Sof" ("God's Infinite Light") before the beginning of the creative process.
The "Ohr Ein Sof" is a paradoxical form of divine self-revelation.
These are above any world/limitation.
Kabbalah considered the functional question whether the "Ein Sof" represents God's divine essence or God as First Cause.
Chabad intellectual Hasidic thought explores "Atzmut" (divine essence) in the purpose of Creation.
Ten stages of God’s Infinite Light in Kabbalistic terminology before the beginning of Creation: 
Tzimtzum.
Three stages of the "Sod HaTzimtzum" ("Secret of Contraction") taught in the new doctrines of Lurianic Kabbalah.
These received differing interpretations after Luria, from the literal (more mythological) to the metaphorical (more philosophical).
In this dynamic myth, the first act in Creation was Divine Self-Withdrawal, the opposite of Creative revelation.
"Tzimtum" is a paradox as Creation depends on God also being present in the vacuum and resulting existence: 
Adam Kadmon.
Adam Kadmon ("Primordial Man"), an anthropomorphic term, is the revelation of the specific Divine Will for Creation after the Tzimtzum.
Its paradoxical nature is expressed as both Adam (creation) and "Kadmon" ("primary" divinity).
As the level of Keter ("Crown") divine will, it is pure light, with no vessels, bounded by its future potential to create vessels.
It is sometimes counted as the first of the Five Worlds, but its supreme transcendence is prior to the emergence of the sefirot and "Shevirat Hakeilim" ("Shattering of their Vessels"): 
Akudim, Nekudim, Berudim.
Three Worlds of "lights" and "vessels" resulting from the interacting lights that emanated from Adam Kadmon, in the [[Lurianic Kabbalah]].
Each embodies different stages in the emergence of the 10 "[[sefirot]]" ("Divine Attributes").
Their progression corresponds to the archetypal realms of [[Tohu and Tikun|"Tohu" and "Tikun"]] ("Chaos and Rectification") described in the new doctrines of Luria.
"Tohu" causes "Shevirat HaKeilim" ("Shattering of the sephirot Vessels"), the catastrophic exile in Creation: 
Keter of Atzilut.
[[File:Complex qaballah.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Diagram of the "[[Partzufim]]" countenances, "Reishin" heads, and "Dikna" beard Divine aspects configurations in [[Atziluth]]]] 
The World of [[Atziluth]] ("Emanation") is the first of the comprehensive [[Four Worlds]] (ABiY"A) of our Created Order, which are collectively the realm of "Tikun" ("Rectification") of the Shattered Vessels from "Tohu".
"Atzilut" completes the Upper rectification, which began in "Berudim", through the "sephirot" transforming into "[[Partzufim]]" ("Divine Countenances").
"Partzufim" harmonise the "sephirot" in the scheme of "Yosher" ("Upright") full interacting configurations in the form of Man. Rectification of "Atzilut" begins with rectification of its "[[Keter]]" ("Crown") Will.
Eight rectification stages in "Keter D'Atzilut" ("The Crown of Emanation"): 
Atzilut.
[[Tohu and Tikun|Rectification]] of "Olam Ha'[[Atziluth]]" (the "World of Emanation"), first of the [[Four Worlds]], is completed with ten stages of Partzufim (Divine "Countenances") after "Keter".
Each of the 6 Primary and 12 Secondary "Partzufim" correspond to the 10 Sephirot arranging around one of their number.
Interaction of the "Partzufim" rectifies "Atzilut" eternally, completing Upper rectification.
Redemption of the fallen sparks by Man rectifies the time-connected three lower Worlds Below.
"Atzilut" is separated from the three independent lower Worlds by its exclusive consciousness of Divine Unity, without self-awareness.
The infinite insight of [[Chokhmah]] (Divine Wisdom) predominates, beyond intellectual grasp.
[[Ayin and Yesh|Creation from Nothing]] is seen from the view of "Ayin" (Nothingness), realising its own non-existence in "Bitul ha-Atzmis" (Nullification of Essence).
The world of the Divine Anthropos ([[sefirot]] and partzufim).
The 10 "sephirot" shine in each of the Four Worlds, the last "sephirah" "Malkuth" ("Kingship") of a World becoming the first "sephirah" "Keter" ("Crown") of the next Realm.
"Malkuth" of "Atzilut", called "God's speech", the source of [[Prophets in Judaism|Prophecy]], is the general source of independent Creation.
The Lower Unity.
The beginning of self-aware ego, the spiritual worlds perceiving themselves to exist, as created realms independent from God, despite the ultimate illusion of this.
The worlds can only reach "Bitul Ha-[[Ayin and Yesh|Yesh]]" (Nullification of Being), not the "Bitul Ha-Atzmis" (Nullification of Essence) characterised by Atzilut.
Beriah.
[[File:Ezekiel's vision.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Prophets in Judaism|Hebrew prophets]] envisioned the [[Throne of God]] of [[Beri'ah|Beriah]] with [[Merkabah mysticism|angelic retinue]].

Analogies for Seder Hishtalshelut.
The basic stations of this process from above to below are: 
Although these are the basic stations, each level contains innumerable details.
To understand Seder Hishtalshelus properly, one must first understand how all of the analogies exist in a person.
Once one has understood this, one can begin to see how all of these levels exist in the world.
Then, one will be able to take any event or aspect of creation and trace it up the chain to God Himself, then back down to the original view and see how God is literally here with us, relating to us directly through his creations.
The purpose of learning about Seder Hishtalshelus in [[Hasidic philosophy|Hasidic thought]] is not merely to know about many distinct levels, rather, the purpose is to see how all the levels in between us and God are transparent and irrelevant, and in truth God is relating to us directly, and there is "none besides for Him".
(Deuteronomy 4:35) Because of this, the [[Tanya (Judaism)|Tanya]] states that learning about the Seder Hishtalshelus will bring a person to a "complete heart".
This is much like two friends talking on the phone.
There are many stages one's voice must undergo before it reaches the other.
Yet, the two people are talking to each other, not to their phones.
The stages in between become irrelevant and transparent in such a situation.
One can understand these levels through the analogy of a man who wants a house.
The hishtalshelus is generally broken down into two general stages, called the "Upper Unity" and the "Lower Unity".
Below are the relevant analogies for all the basic stations of the hishtalshelus in the analogy of a man who wants a house starting from the top (primordial desires) and going down (until the desire is actualized).
Only Analogies.
While the Hasidic texts offer many analogies of how Seder Hishtalshelus exists within a person, such as the one given above, they also emphasize that these are only analogies and the analogue is nothing like the analogies.
These analogies are meant only to give a glimpse into Seder Hishtalshelus in a way that we are familiar with, but the true analogue deals with how God interrelates with our world.
Much like a house, God desires a "dwelling place" in this world.
This means He desired that his Essence be revealed through the medium of this world much like a person might wish his own essence to be revealed through the medium of his house.
While analogies are a necessary step, the true goal of studying Seder Hishlshelus must be to pick out the point that unites all of the analogies and apply it to the analogue i.e. how God is being revealed in our world directly.
On the other hand, the analogies are not vague, These analogies are precise and exact, much scholarly work has been dedicated to understanding and analyzing why particular analogies have been used, some that are not, and some that are inconsistent in application (i.e. a text may use different analogies to demonstrate the same point - the analysis required is to understand and examine the deficiency in each analogy, and how they can be reconciled with each other) 
Relation to Western philosophy.
Study and [[Jewish meditation|contemplation]] of Seder Hishtalshelus is central to the Intellectual-Hasidism school of [[Chabad]].
Some speculate that the recent Hasidic explanations of Seder Hishtalshelus may have been influenced by certain principles in [[Western philosophy]].
Various dichotomies mentioned in philosophy are strikingly similar to those mentioned in late Hasidic texts: Form/Matter, Sense/Feeling, Initial Cognition/Semiotic Cognition/Semiotic Transition.
Furthermore, the prose of the [[Sholom Dovber Schneersohn|Rebbe Rashab]] is almost identical to that of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G.
W.
F.
Hegel]].
Others counter that the dichotomies meantioned in Hasidic texts originate in sources predating Western philosophy.
Proponents of [[Hasidic philosophy]], counter that since Intellectual-Hasidut is an essential wisdom that is higher than, and includes all other wisdoms it would necessarily make reference to all other forms of wisdom, whether Western or otherwise.
They would argue that such similarities are not proof of influence of Western philosophy, but rather are evidence that Hasidic philosophy touches upon, unites, and enlightens every other wisdom, whether it be Torah or secular.
The website and books of Sanford Drob bring the Seder Hishtalshelut [[Theosophy|theosophical]] scheme of [[Lurianic Kabbalah]] into dialogue with [[Modernity|Modern]] and [[Postmodernism|Postmodern]] Philosophy and Psychology.
In our age when Western philosophy deconstructs the possibility of metaphysics, he sees the Lurianic scheme as an essence-myth that transcends and incorporates secular disciplines, allowing it to re-open the possibilities of philosophy.
This process both enriches the secular disciplines, while giving intellectual insights into the Lurianic myth through revealing its facets in human life.
This dialogue includes [[Dialectic#Hegelian dialectic|Hegelian dialectics]] and its application in [[Marxism]], [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Carl Jung|Jung]] and [[Deconstruction]]ism, as well as ancient systems of thought.

Kum Nye 

Kum Nye and sKu-mNyé are a wide variety of Tibetan religious and medical body practices.
Many Tibetan Buddhist and Bon traditions contain Kum Nye practices.
These can be entirely different both in purpose and in methods.
For instance, some forms are very slow-moving; others are intensely aerobic.
The Tibetan Medical Tantras (scriptures) are the basis for some practices, and are mainly therapeutic.
Dzogchen is the basis for other practices which are mainly religious in purpose.
Three systems of "sku mnye" have been described and taught in detail in English.
These are Kum Nye by Tarthang Tulku, the Aro gTér sKu-mNyé and the systems of "bsku mnye", that are taught by the International Academy for Traditional Tibetan Medicine and the Shang Shung Institute.
Etymology.
The two terms Kum Nye and sKu-mNyé are different spellings in the Latin alphabet of the same Tibetan phrase Wylie: "sku mnye", which literally means "massage of the subtle body".
Some forms of "sku mnye" are vaguely similar to Yoga, Tai chi, Qigong, or therapeutic massage.
Kum Nye, Ku Nye, and Kunye are also used to transcribe the Tibetan phrases "dku mnye" ("belly massage") and "bsku mnye" (oil massage), pronounced identically to "sku mnye". "dKu mnye" and "bsku mnye" manipulate the physical body, rather than the subtle (energetic) one.
Tarthang Tulku's Kum Nye.
Lama Tarthang Tulku first introduced Kum Nye into the West.
He has written five books on the subject.
This system appears to be largely from the Medical Tantras, but includes exercises similar to those found in the Dzogchen series.
It is based on very slow movements, stillness practices, and massage.
This Kum Nye has been described as Inner Massage.
Exercises.
To give an example, in the exercise called "flying" the practitioner extends their arms slowly out from the side up to stretching above the head and then slowly back down again.
One cycle can take anywhere between 2 and 10 minutes.
The practice of breathing in and out of both nose and mouth at the same time is recommended while doing the exercises.
The key is to pay close attention to the subtleties of sensations and the quality of experience while doing the exercises, thus linking body and mind in the presence of awareness given to the sensations.
Aro gTér sKu-mNyé.
This system is part of the Aro gTér, a Nyingma terma.
It is described in detail in the book "moving being", by Khandro Déchen.
Aro sKu-mNyé belongs to Longdé, the section of Dzogchen concerned with the subtle body.
As with all Dzogchen methods, its main goal is to realize rigpa, or non-dual awareness.
This is described as "finding the presence of awareness in the dimension of sensation".
Physical exercises are used to "shake" the tsa-lung system of energetic "channels", winds", and "essences".
This perceptually disorients the practitioner, and produces "zap nyams".
Zap nyams (Wylie: "zab nyams"), literally "profound experiences" in Tibetan, are described as "intense psychophysical sensations".
These are said to occur in the energetic space that surrounds the body, rather than in the physical body.
Although the purpose of the Aro gTér sKu-mNyé is mainly religious, the system is said also to have a variety of mundane benefits, including more vivid sensory experience, emotional openness, enhanced meditation, physical fitness, and lessening of depression.
In practice, Aro sKu-mNyé is a set of 111 movement exercises divided into series that correspond to the Buddhist five elements.
They range from simple and gentle to vigorous and extremely difficult, and bear no similarity to any other Eastern or Western form of exercise.
The moving exercises are alternated with periods of motionless meditation.
The instructions for the Aro sKu-mNyé exercises frequently give very specific details about eye movements.
Aro sKu-mNyé is taught by instructors certified by a board headed by the Aro Lamas.
Exercise example: "waking lion".
"lie on your back / legs splayed as far apart as comfortable / arms 90 degrees to your body / palms upwards / eyes closed / simultaneously (with a quick movement) raise your torso and legs (legs straight and locked at the knee) / simultaneously clap feet together and hands together (arms are straight and locked at the elbow) / in the moment of clapping, open eyes wide and shout Ra! (roll the 'R' to enunciate fiercely) / when clapping feet and hands, eyes, hands, and feet should be at the same height – feet and hands meet at the same level as your eyes; and at this point your bottom is all that is touching the floor / it is important that the back is kept absolutely straight / try to achieve an angle of 45 degrees to the floor, but NOT by bending your back – bending the back will result in injury! / relax back into the starting position and repeat" 
IATTM Ku Nye.
The Ku Nye taught by the International Academy for Traditional Tibetan Medicine is a system of therapeutic oil massage.
It is based in the Medical Tantras.
Its benefits are said to include elimination of toxins, increased vitality, pain reduction, and calming of nervous disorders including insomnia, depression and anxiety.
Shang Shung Institute Kunye.
The Shang Shung Institute, affiliated with Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, offers a Training program in Kunye Massage.
Sacred Space (website) 
Sacred Space is a prayer website that was founded in 1999.
It was created by two members of the Jesuit order, Alan McGuckian and Peter Scally, and was managed by the Jesuit Communication Centre, Dublin, Ireland, until June 2008.
The site is updated daily, guiding users through a ten-minute session of prayer centered on a passage of scripture.
History.
The notion of a website about prayer came to the two Jesuits when they were working in communications.
McGuckian and Scally noticed that increasing numbers of office workers sit at a computer for hours every day, often doing repetitive work.
They reasoned that people work better if they break that routine every now and again; and prayer is one way of breaking the routine.
People as far away as the Arctic Circle and Australia log onto the site.
Speaking in "The Tablet", Jan 18, 2003, Scally stated, "A person at the computer has a sense of privacy and intimacy; comfortable, upright, and attentive, subconsciously screening out all distractions, he concentrates on the screen -gazes in fact on that screen.
What better description of the attitude of attentive listening to God?"
The appeal of the Internet for prayer is perhaps understandable, not only because it provides the user with the privacy needed for personal prayer, but also because the multi media approach to prayer, now offered by many websites makes prayer more stimulating than a mental exercise.
Developments.
"Sacred Space" attracts over five million visits annually.
Most of this traffic has been engendered by word of mouth.
The website has been produced in almost thirty languages over the site's lifetime.
This level of interest led an Australian publishing house, Michelle Anderson Publishing, to approach the Jesuit Communication Centre about bringing out a hard-copy version of the daily prayers.
Ave Maria Press, Veritas and Jesuit Communications in Manila, also bring out annual volumes of "Sacred Space - The Prayer Book" of which a Kindle edition is also available from Amazon.
Advent and Lent editions have proven popular and have helped thousands of people to bring the simple yet helpful structure to their prayer.
According to Piaras Jackson, an Irish Jesuit priest who has been involved with the site for a number of years, only five percent of users are from Ireland.
Of the English language section, most visitors are from the United States, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand.
Jackson attributes the popularity of "Sacred Space" to the facts that it is immediately available 24/7, current with daily scripture readings; and allows anonymity, requiring no log-in.
Last year alone its pages were viewed almost 30 million times from over 200 countries.
Enlightenment Intensive 
An Enlightenment Intensive is a group retreat designed to enable a spiritual enlightenment experience within a relatively short time.
Devised by Americans Charles Berner and his wife, Ava Berner, in the 1960s.
The format combines the self-enquiry meditation method popularised by Ramana Maharshi with interpersonal communication processes such as the dyad structure of co-counselling in a structure that resembles both a traditional Zen "sesshin" (meditation retreat) and group psychotherapy.
Religious teachings and philosophical concepts are generally avoided.
Origins.
Charles Berner (1927 – 2007), who was later known as Yogeshwar Muni, created the Enlightenment Intensive.
In the 1960s, he formed the Institute of Ability where he and his wife Ava promoted “holistic health techniques such as fasting and massage, communication exercises like those used in encounter groups, emotional release therapies, past life regression, and a host of other modalities popular among the 1960s counterculture.”
Berner was known for his skills in helping people improve their life.
He taught that honest communication and understanding between one’s self and others was the path to improved relationships, enlightenment and fulfilling the purpose of Life.
Charles Berner had observed that those who were most identified with their self-image, ego or personality tended not to make much progress in personal therapy, which may require flexibility.
Mystics who practise insight or jnana yoga report a momentary change of consciousness bringing a direct experience of the reality or truth of self or of others, or of existence, such as is known in various traditions as kensho, satori or samadhi.
But traditional techniques for this realisation depend upon a monastic or eremitic life difficult to attain for the average Westerner.
In spring 1968, it "just suddenly occurred" to Charles Berner - "what source it came from I know not but it wasn't a process of sitting down and figuring it out" - to combine meditation methods with the structure of an interpersonal workshop.
The first experimental Enlightenment Intensive was held soon afterwards in the California desert with Charles and Ava Berner.
Bill Savoie, in an unpublished book, The Bridge to One, writes that “in May 1968 Charles announced we would have a 5 day Enlightenment Intensive.
We would just go for it and see what would happen.
Charles had a community of about 150 people who would stay connected with his teachings.
At that first Enlightenment Intensive there were 26 people.
Both Peggy and I were there."
“The Enlightenment Intensive retreat that Berner created in 1968 grew out of his interest and research with using interpersonal communication to facilitate the enlightened state and personal growth.
Berner wondered if there were more effective ways to accelerate spiritual development and personal growth for his students and clients.”
Berner combined the 10,000 year old self inquiry meditation, ‘Who Am I’, with a 20th Century western communication technique developed by Ava Berner called the relating dyad.
The result that Berner and his students discovered was that this combination increased consciousness and quickened the process of enlightenment.
“Presentation is the technique used by us,” writes Berner in a booklet titled, Enlightenment.
“By continual interaction with another, by presenting continually to another the results of contemplation of the nature of one’s self, the process of enlightenment is accelerated.
One maintains his state of increased consciousness because it is achieved while in contact with another, and so one is in Life and the enlightenment is useful.”(5) This was a major discovery in the history enlightenment techniques.
Berner ran dozens over the next few years, gradually refining the format and method, optimising the retreat for the "weekend truth-seeker".
He also trained others to lead groups.
His 99th Enlightenment Intensive was held in Berkeley in 1975 and he held several more in the late 1970s at his ashram in St. Helena, California, known as Kayavarohana West.
Structure.
The typical intensive is three days long.
There are also longer Enlightenment Intensives (e.g., seven days, two weeks, six weeks) using essentially the same format as a three-day.
They are led by a "master" or "facilitator" whose role is to set up the retreat, ensure it runs smoothly and provide participants with information, support and encouragement, both as a whole and individually.
It has a set of rules designed to ensure a single-minded focus on the purpose of the retreat.
A typical day starts early in the morning and lasts until late in the evening.
The day usually consists of a single structure interspersed with eating, washing, exercise, work and meditation.
Each day there are ten to twelve 40-minute periods where participants work in dyads, rotating partners, giving an instruction, chosen by the participant or the master/facilitator, often called a "koan".
The most usual instructions are "tell me who you are", "tell me what you are", "tell me what life is" or "tell me what another is".
One partner gives the instruction to the other and listens intently without any response.
The "talking" partner looks for a direct experiential answer and reports it to their partner.
This continues for 5 minutes when, in response to a bell or chime, the "talking" partner becomes the "listening" partner for 5 minutes.
After 40 minutes there is a break before resuming with another partner.
When participants have a direct experience of great clarity, they may present an answer to the master/facilitator.
The participant then continues, either with another instruction or the same instruction.
There may be a period on the last day to support integration of the experience into daily life.
There may also be a follow-up meeting after some days.
Influence.
Enlightenment Intensives are now held in many countries around the world.
They may be offered as a "stand-alone" process outside any tradition, movement or organization.
There are also numerous derivative processes going by different names, perhaps involving some alteration of the format.
Meditation music 
Meditation music is music performed to aid in the practice of meditation.
It can have a specific religious content, but also more recently has been associated with modern composers who use meditation techniques in their process of composition, or who compose such music with no particular religious group as a focus.
The concept also includes music performed as an act of meditation.
History.
Modern meditation music in the 20th century began when composers such as John Cage, Stuart Dempster, Pauline Oliveros, Terry Riley, La Monte Young and Lawrence Ball began to combine meditation techniques and concepts, and music.
Specific works include Karlheinz Stockhausen's "Inori" (1974), "Mantra" (1970), "Hymnen" (1966–67), "Stimmung" (1968), and "Aus den sieben Tagen" (1968), and Ben Johnston, whose "Visions and Spells" (a realization of "Vigil" (1976)), requires a meditation period prior to performance.
R.
Murray Schafer's concepts of clairaudience (clean hearing) as well as the ones found in his "The Tuning of the World" (1977) are meditative.
Stockhausen describes "Aus den sieben Tagen" as "intuitive music" and in the piece "Es" from this cycle the performers are instructed to play only when not thinking or in a state of nonthinking (Von Gunden asserts that this is contradictory and should be "think about your playing").
John Cage was influenced by Zen and pieces such as "Imaginary Landscape No. 4" for twelve radios are "meditations that measure the passing of time".
Relational effects.
Music can provide many psychological benefits including stress reduction, improved memory, and general improvement to cognitive performance.
Research shows that the activity of listening to music can aid in detaching a person from their surroundings and help focus on their own thoughts and actions.
When applied specifically to a meditative setting, music can aid in mindfulness, visualization, and contemplation.
According to the NHS, these qualities can increase personal awareness and help identify signs of stress and anxiety.
Practicing mindfulness can help a person be more observant of their present thoughts and actions.
Research shows that meditation music can improve confidence during the practice of meditation.
In a July 2018 study, volunteers between ages 60–80 who were listening to healing music and meditating for 1–2 hours a day and eating a sugar-free healthy diet exhibited sharper memory and cognitive skills with happy and cheerful behavioral patterns compared to those who were not.
Meditation music can help improve focus while doing mechanical tasks.
A June 2019 study that observed neurosurgeons performing microsurgical training bypasses with and without meditation music showed a slight improvement in the total time utilized by novice surgeons.
While the total time utilized by experienced surgeons remained unchanged, the thread length used in the training bypasses was significantly different for both surgeons.
Meditation music can have positive effects on people recovering from drug addiction.
In general, spiritual meditation may promote addiction recovery as well as improve the psychological and mental health outcomes of drug addiction; this includes reducing depression, anxiety and stress symptoms.
In a January 2020 study, it was concluded that meditation music conducted by Young-Dong Kim can be useful therapy to prevent the reinstatement of methamphetamine addiction during abstinence in rats.
Christian meditation music.
Some Christian faiths, particularly the Catholic Church, reject meditation practice from outside their traditions, particularly new-age music.
However, the Olivier Messiaen piece referenced above is explicitly Christian, and Messiaen himself was a practicing Catholic and a church organist.
Olivier Messiaen's "Quartet for the End of Time" (1941).
Zen meditation music.
Specific works include Tony Scott's "Music for Zen Meditation".
Tapas (Indian religions) 
Tapas (Sanskrit: तपस्) is a variety of austere spiritual meditation practices in Indian religions.
In Jainism, it means asceticism (austerities, body mortification); in Buddhism, it denotes spiritual practices including meditation and self-discipline; and in the different traditions within Hinduism it means a spectrum of practices ranging from asceticism, inner cleansing to self-discipline by meditation practices.
The "Tapas" practice often involves solitude and is a part of monastic practices that are believed to be a means to moksha (liberation, salvation).
In the Vedas literature of Hinduism, fusion words based on "tapas" are widely used to expound several spiritual concepts that develop through heat or inner energy, such as meditation, any process to reach special observations and insights, the spiritual ecstasy of a yogin or "Tāpasa" (a vṛddhi derivative meaning "a practitioner of austerities, an ascetic"), even warmth of sexual intimacy.
In certain contexts, the term means penance, pious activity, as well as severe meditation.
Etymology and meaning.
"Tapas" is based on the root "Tap" (तप्) meaning "to heat, to give out warmth, to shine, to burn".
The term evolves to also mean "to suffer, to mortify the body, undergo penance" in order to "burn away past karma" and liberate oneself.
The term "Tapas" means "warmth, heat, fire".
The meaning of the word evolves in ancient Indian literature.
The earliest discussions of "tapas", and compound words from the root "tap" relate to the heat necessary for biological birth.
Its conceptual origin is traced to the natural wait, motherly warmth and physical "brooding" provided by birds such as a hen upon her eggs - a process that is essential to hatching and birth.
The Vedic scholars used mother nature's example to explain and extend this concept to the hatching of knowledge and spiritual rebirth.
Some of the earliest reference of "tapas", and compound words from the root "tap" is found in many ancient Hindu scriptures, including the Ŗig Veda (10.154.5), Shatapatha Brahmana (5.3 - 5.17), and Atharva Veda (4.34.1, 6.61.1, 11.1.26).
In these texts, "tapas" is described as the process that led to the spiritual birth of ṛṣis - sages of spiritual insights.
The Atharva Veda suggests all the gods were "tapas"-born ("tapojās"), and all earthly life was created from the sun's "tapas" ("tapasah sambabhũvur").
In the Jāiminiya-Upanisad Brāhmaņa, life perpetuates itself and creates progeny by "tapas", a process that starts with sexual heat.
Sanskrit "tapasyā" (neuter gender), literally "produced by heat", refers to a personal endeavor of discipline, undertaken to achieve a goal.
One who undertakes tapas is a "Tapasvin".
The fire deity in Hinduism, "Agni", is central to many Hindu rituals such as "yajna" and "homa".
Agni is considered an agent of heat, of sexual energy, of incubation; Agni is considered a great "tapasvin".
The word "tapasvi" refers to a male ascetic or meditator, while "tapasvinī" to a female.
Buddhism.
Before he reached his enlightenment, the Buddha tried asceticism (self-mortification) of the type found in other Śramaṇa religions (Jainism), and this is referred to as "Tapas" (Tibetan: "dka' thub", Chinese: "kuxing", Japanese: "kugyo", Korean: "kohaeng").
Post-enlightenment, the Buddhist doctrines of the Middle Way and Noble Eightfold Path did not include ascetic practices.
The Buddha, in multiple Buddhist texts, such as "Majjhima Nikaya" and "Devadaha Sutta", attributes the ascetic self-mortification style "Tapas" practices to Jainism ("Niganthas"), wherein such practices annihilate past Karmas and stop new Karmas from being created, ones that lead to the cycle of rebirths in Saṃsāra.
These ancient Buddhist texts are significant in their claims of the existence of Jain Brahmins and ascetics, along with their karma doctrine and reasons for their "Tapas" practices in ancient times: 
These ascetic "Tapas" practices is also confirmed by Jainism texts such as "Uttarajjhyayana".
The Buddhist scholar Dharmakirti strongly criticizes the Jaina practice of "Tapas" as a means of liberation, while many Jainism scholars have in turn strongly criticized Dharmakirti opinion and analysis, explaining why their approach to ascetic "Tapas" is appropriate.
According to Hajime Nakamura and other scholars, some scriptures of early Buddhism suggest that ascetic "Tapas" was a part of Buddhist practice in its early days, wherein body-mortification was an option for the Buddhist monk in his spiritual practice.
In the Theravada tradition of Thailand, a monastic practice emerged in the 12th-century who did "Tapas" as ascetic wandering and forest or crematory dwelling monks, with austere practices, and these came to be known as "Thudong".
These ascetic Buddhist monks are also found in Myanmar, and as in Thailand, they are known to pursue their own version of Buddhism, resisting the hierarchical institutionalized "sangha" structure of monasteries in Buddhism.
Textual evidence suggests that ascetic"Tapas" practices were a part of the Buddhist tradition in Sri Lanka by the 3rd century BCE, and this tradition continued through the medieval era in parallel to "sangha" style monastic tradition.
In the Mahayana tradition, asceticism with esoteric and mystical meanings became an accepted practice, such as in the Tendai and Shingon schools of Japanese Buddhism.
These Japanese practices included penance, austerities, ablutions under a waterfall, and rituals to purify oneself.
Japanese records from the 12th century record stories of monks undertaking severe asceticism, while records suggest that 19th century Nichiren Buddhist monks woke up at midnight or 2:00 AM daily, and performed ascetic water purification rituals as a part of "Tapas".
Other practices include the extreme ascetic practices of eating only pine needles, resins, seeds and ultimately self-mummification, while alive, or "Sokushinbutsu" ("miira") in Japan.
Elsewhere, in mainstream Buddhism, over time the meaning of the word "Tapas" evolved, wherein ascetic penance was forsaken, and "Tapas" meant meditative and spiritual practices.
The word "Tapas" appears extensively in Buddhist literature where, states Richard Gombrich, it does not mean "asceticism or mortification".
The term "Tapas" means "meditation" or "reasoned moral self discipline" or both in Buddhism.
According to Bailey and Mabbett, these Buddhist ideas are similar to those found in the Brahmanical (Vedic) tradition, wherein there is a great deal of overlap in the concepts of "Tapas", Yoga, meditation and gnosis (knowledge), yet the term "Tapas" is rooted in the inner "mystic heat" themes of the Indian religions.
Hinduism.
History.
The earliest mention of "Tapas" is in the Vedic texts.
The concept of "Tapas" as symbolism for spiritual rebirth begins in the Vedas.
Atharva Veda verse 11.5.3 compares the process of spiritual rebirth of a student in care of his or her teacher, with the gestation process during the biological birth of a baby in a mother's womb.
"Tapas" is also found in the Upanishads.
The "Chāndogya Upaniṣad", for example, suggests that those who engage in ritualistic offerings to gods and priests will fail in their spiritual practice while those who engage in tapas and self-examination will succeed.
The "Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad" states that realization of self requires a search for truth and "Tapas" (meditation).
Meditation and achievement of lucid knowledge is declared essential to self-realization in ancient scriptures.
Texts by Adi Sankara suggests "Tapas" is important, but not sufficient for spiritual practice.
Later Hindu scholars introduce a discussion of ‘false ascetic’, as one who go through the mechanics of tapas, without meditating on the nature of Brahman.
Tapas is an element of spiritual path, state Indian texts.
The concept is extensively mentioned in the Vedas, and the Upanishads.
According to Walter Kaelber, and others, in certain translations of ancient Sanskrit documents "Tapas" is interpreted as austerities and asceticism; however, this is frequently inadequate because it fails to reflect the context implied, which is of sexual heat or warmth that incubates the birth of life.
The idea of linking austerity, exertion, fatigue and self-renunciation to the ancient idea of heat, brooding and inner devotion, comes from the observed labor every mother puts in caring for its embryo and delivering her baby, regardless of the life form.
The concept and reference to 'egg hatching' is replaced in Sanskrit texts written in later centuries, with simply 'brooding' or 'incubation'.
In ancient literature of Hinduism dedicated to love, desire, lust, seduction and sex, the root of the word "Tapas" is commonly used.
For example, in Atharva Veda, a mantra recommended for a woman who wishes to win or compel a man's love is, 'Love's consuming longing, this passion this yearning, which the gods have poured, into the waters of life, I kindle for thee ("tam te tapāmi"), by the law of Varuna.'
Desire ("kāma") is homologized with the concept of "Tapas", to explain the feelings and inner energy that leads to sexual intercourse.
Agnicayana, Satapatha Brahmana and other ancient texts similarly use the root of the word "Tapas" to symbolize emotions, biological stages and a mother's effort from conception to the birth of a baby.
Both meanings of "Tapas" are found in various Hindu texts.
In some ancient texts, "Tapas" has the sense of ascetic mortification in a sense similar to other Indian religions, while in the Bhagavad Gita and the Yoga school of Hinduism, the term means self-training and virtuous living in a sense similar to Buddhism.
In the Puranas and the texts of the goddess tradition of Hinduism, the term is equivalent to a devotion with intense self-discipline, believed to yield special inner powers.
In contemporary usage, any practice that includes hardship and requires perseverance – such as fasting during Vrata – is called "Tapas".
Yoga and brahmacharya.
Patañjali, in his "Yoga Sūtra", lists "Tāpas" as one of the Niyamas (virtuous practices), and describes it in several sections such as 2.32, 2.43 and 4.1.
The term includes self-discipline, meditation, simple and austere living or any means of inner self-purification.
"Tapas" in the Patanjali text and other Hindu texts on Yoga, states Benjamin Smith, is that which is "a means for perfection of the body and the organs through the lessening of impurities" and a foundation for a yogi's pursuit of perfection.
"Yama, niyama, asana" and "pranayama" from "Ashtanga yoga" comes under tapas.
"Tapas" in the Hindu traditions is part of a stage of life, called brahmacharya.
The Vedic literature suggests "diksa" (incubation of a student in a field of knowledge) requires "tapas", and "tapas" is enabled by the state of brahmacharya.
This state sometimes includes "tapas" such as "vrata" (fasting, sacrifice of food), "sram" (philanthropic social work, sacrifice of income), silence (sacrifice of speech), and asceticism (bare minimum living, sacrifice of comfort).
Oldenberg notes that Brahmana scripture suggests that the Brahmachari should carry tapas to the very tip of his existence, which includes not cutting his hair, nail and beard.
Thus, during this process of spiritual rebirth and "diksa", the "tapas" observed by a Brahmachari may include silence, fasting, seclusion, chastity, as well other activities.
The goal of "tapas" is to help focus the Brahmachari on meditation, observation of reality, reflection and spiritual rebirth.
Brahmacharya and "tapasya" are interrelated, with the student life expected to simple and austere, dedicated to the learning.
Jainism.
"Tapas" is a central concept in Jainism.
It refers to the spiritual practice of body mortification, penance, and austerities, in order to burn away past karma and stop producing new karma, thereby reaching "siddha" (liberating oneself).
Ascetic "Tapas" among Jaina monks, both internal and external, is believed to be essential for spiritual growth and "kevalya" (moksha, liberation).
The details of the "Tapas" practices vary between the different traditions within Jainism.
The Jain text "Sarvarthasiddhi", a commentary by Pujyapada, claims that the Hindu Samkhya school emphasizes "knowledge only, no practices", while the Vaisheshikas emphasize "practices only, no knowledge" as part of "Tapas" and the means of reaching moksha.
Another Jain text "Tattvartha Sutra", by Umaswati, in chapter 9, asserts that "Tapas" includes several kinds of meditation.
The "Tapas" in Jainism include internal practices and external austerities.
External "Tapas" include fasting, tolerating hardships inflicted by other people or animals, tolerating all discomfort from weather by nakedness or near nakedness and the lack of any possessions, lack of shelter, walking and wandering alone without fearing anything and without hurting anyone.
The internal "Tapas" include words and inner thoughts (intent) that resonate with the external "Tapas" (action).
The list of internal and external austerities in Jainism vary with the text and tradition, with "Tattvartha Sutra", "Uttaradhyayana Sutra" and "Bhagavati Sutra" stating: 
In Jainism, "Tapas" implies a control on desires, and is a form a self purification.
Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara undertook ascetic "Tapas" for twelve years, after which he attained Kevala Jnana (liberating supreme knowledge).
Ajivikas.
Ajivikas was another ancient Indian religion which survived through about 13th-century CE, but became extinct thereafter, in which "Tapas" was a central concept as a means of salvation.
According to Arthur Basham, the Ajivikas believed in the most rigorous ascetic practices in public.
They believed in not harming anything and not being a cause of hurt to any living creature or substance, so they ate refuse, waste products, went deep into forests, mountains or isolated caves to live their austere life.
One of the Buddhist canonical texts, "Nanguttha Jataka", claims that the Ajivikas perform severe ascetic practices as part of their "Tapas", including sleeping on a bed of thorns and other forms of self-mortification.
The Jainism text "Sthananga Sutra" claims that the Ajivikas performed severe penances and self-mortification as part of their "Tapas" practice.
A mention of the ascetic practices of Ajivikas is found in Chinese and Japanese Buddhist literature, where they are spelled as "Ashibikas".
Ajivikas were a Śramaṇa religion, just like Buddhism and Jainism, and these competed with each other.
Most of the Ajivika texts have not survived.
The "Tapas" practices of Ajivikas, as well as other information about them is primarily from the Buddhist and Jain texts; scholars question whether the description of Ajivikas has been fairly and completely summarized in these, or are these polemic misrepresentations.
Modern practice.
Modern practitioners pursue "Tapas" - meditation and study of religion in ashrams across India.
Prayer rope 
A prayer rope is a loop made up of complex woven knots formed in a cross pattern, usually out of wool or silk.
Prayer ropes are part of the practice of Eastern Orthodox monks and nuns and are employed by monastics (and sometimes by others) to count the number of times one has prayed the Jesus Prayer or, occasionally, other prayers.
The typical prayer rope has thirty three knots, representing the thirty three years of Christ's life.
Among the Oriental Orthodoxy, it is used in the Coptic, Ethiopian, and Eritrean Orthodox Churches, where it is known by its Coptic or Ge'ez name.
Description.
Historically, the prayer rope would typically have 100 knots, although prayer ropes with 150, 60, 50, 33, 64 or 41 knots can also be found in use today.
There are even small, 10-knot prayer ropes intended to be worn on the finger.
Hermits in their cells may have prayer ropes with as many as 300 or 500 knots in them.
Characteristically, the knots of a prayer rope are diamond knots (ABoK #787).
There is typically a knotted cross where the prayer rope is joined together to form a loop, and a few beads at certain intervals between the knots (usually every 10 or 25 knots) for ease in counting.
Longer prayer ropes frequently have a tassel at the end of the cross; its purpose is to dry the tears shed due to heartfelt compunction for one's sins.
The tassel can also be said to represent the glory of the Heavenly Kingdom, which one can only enter through the Cross.
Additionally, the tassel represents an inherited tradition of prayer.
The symbol of tassels as tradition coming from Old Testament commandments to Jews to wear tassels on their garments to keep in mind the received laws.
The prayer rope is commonly made out of wool, symbolizing the flock of Christ; though in modern times other materials are used also.
The traditional color of the rope is black (symbolizing mourning for one's sins), with either black or colored beads.
The beads (if they are colored) and at least a portion of the tassel are traditionally red, symbolizing the blood of Christ and the blood of the martyrs.
In recent times, however, prayer ropes have been made in a wide variety of colors.
In (Orthodox) Serbian practice, the 33 knotted prayer rope is worn on the left hand, and when praying, held with the thumb and forefinger of the right hand.
Among the Oriental Orthodox, the prayer rope is composed of 41, 64, or 100 beads and is primarily used to recite the Kyrie Eleison (Lord, have mercy) prayer as well as others such as the Lord's Prayer and the Magnificat.
In regards to the first two numbers, the first number represents the number lashes inflicted on Jesus (39 according to Jewish custom) alongside the lance wound and crown of thorns, while the latter represents Mary's age upon her Assumption respectively.
Use.
When praying, the user normally holds the prayer rope in the left hand, leaving the right hand free to make the Sign of the Cross.
When not in use, the prayer rope is traditionally wrapped around the left wrist so that it continues to remind one to pray without ceasing.
If this is impractical, it may be placed in the (left) pocket, but should not be hung around the neck or suspended from the belt.
The reason for this is humility: one should not be ostentatious or conspicuous in displaying the prayer rope for others to see.
During their tonsure (religious profession), Eastern Orthodox monks and nuns receive a prayer rope, with the words: 
Accept, O brother (sister) "(name)", the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God (Ephesians 6:17) in the everlasting Jesus prayer by which you should have the name of the Lord in your soul, your thoughts, and your heart, saying always: "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me a sinner."
Orthodoxy regards the prayer rope as the sword of the Spirit, because prayer which is heartfelt and inspired by the grace of the Holy Spirit is a weapon that defeats the Devil.
Among some Orthodox monastics (and occasionally other faithful), the canonical hours and preparation for Holy Communion may be replaced by praying the Jesus Prayer a specified number of times dependent on the service being replaced.
In this way prayers can still be said even if the service books are for some reason unavailable or the person is not literate or otherwise unable to recite the service; the prayer rope becomes a very practical tool in such cases, simply for keeping count of the prayers said.
However, among some monastics, e.g. hesychasts, this replacement is the norm.
One scheme for replacing the Divine Services with the Jesus Prayer is as follows: 
Over the centuries, various cell rules have developed to help the individual in the daily use of the prayer rope.
However, there is no single, standardized method in use universally throughout the Church.
There may be prostrations after each prayer or after a certain number of prayers, depending upon the particular rule being followed.
Not only is the Jesus Prayer used, but Eastern Christians also have many "breath prayers".
Contrary to thought, they are not to be said using spiritual breathing, as that can only be determined by a spiritual father.
Breath prayers continuously repeated on the prayer rope may include: Lord Have Mercy, Come Lord Jesus, Lord I Believe...Help My Unbelief, Lord Save Me, etc. 
Wearing.
Among the Orthodox believers of Balkan countries, small 33 knot prayer ropes are frequently worn around the wrist.
It is also common, though somewhat less so, to wear the larger 100 knot around the neck.
History.
The history of the prayer rope goes back to the origins of Christian monasticism itself.
The invention of the prayer rope is attributed to Pachomius the Great in the fourth century as an aid for illiterate monks to accomplish a consistent number of prayers and prostrations in their cells.
Previously, monks would count their prayers by casting pebbles into a bowl, but this was cumbersome, and could not be easily carried about when outside the cell.
The use of the rope made it possible to pray the Jesus Prayer unceasingly, whether inside the cell or out, in accordance with Paul the Apostle's injunction to "Pray without ceasing" (I Thessalonians 5:17).
It is said that the method of tying the prayer rope had its origins from the father of Orthodox monasticism, Anthony the Great.
He started by tying a leather rope with a simple knot for every time he prayed Kyrie Eleison ("Lord have Mercy"), but the Devil would come and untie the knots to throw off his count.
He then devised a way—inspired by a vision he had of the Theotokos—of tying the knots so that the knots themselves would constantly make the sign of the cross.
This is why prayer ropes today are still tied using knots that each contain seven little crosses being tied over and over.
The Devil could not untie it because the Devil is vanquished by the Sign of the Cross.
TaKeTiNa Rhythm Process 
The TaKeTiNa Rhythm Process is musical, meditative group process for people who want to develop their awareness of rhythm.
It was developed in the 1970s by the Austrian musician and composer Reinhard Flatischler.
In a TaKeTiNa process, there are three different rhythmic layers—represented by the voice, claps, and steps—that continue simultaneously.
Vocalization and clap rhythms, accompanied by the berimbau, constantly change while the steps, supported by a surdo drum, remain the same.
The surdo stabilizes the basic rhythm of the steps, while call-and-response singing serves to destabilize and re-stabilize the rhythmic movements.
In this process, the simultaneity of stabilization and destabilization creates a disturbance that allows participants to repeatedly fall out, and then fall back into rhythm.
Participants are guided into the experience of rhythm archetypes, rhythmic images anchored deep in human consciousness.
According to Flatischler, the support of the group allows the individual participant to go into his or her own process, building deep musical and personal trust.
TaKeTiNa is used in academic and clinical settings and in corporate trainings worldwide.
Samyama 
Samyama (from Sanskrit संयम saṃ-yama—holding together, tying up, binding, integration) is the combined simultaneous practice of Dhāraṇā (concentration), Dhyāna (meditation) and Samādhi (union).
Description.
Samyama is a tool to receive deeper knowledge of qualities of the object.
It is a term summarizing the "catch-all" process of psychological absorption in the object of meditation.
For Patanjali in his Yoga Sutras, Pratyahara is the preceding stage to practicing and developing Samyama; the "spiritually unevolved" should spend time understanding Ashtanga yoga.
Framework.
Samyama, as Patanjali's Yoga Sutras states, engenders prajñā.
Adi Yoga or Mahasandhi discusses the 'mūla prajñā' of "listening/studying, investigation/contemplation, realization/meditation" which are a transposition of the triune of Samyama.
These are activated subconsciously in "non-structured form" (thus producing fragmented spontaneous Samyama-like effects) by any thinking activity or contemplative absorption (particularly the Catuskoti and Koan) and deep levels of trance.
Any kind of intuitive thinking at its various stages of expression is strongly related to Samyama-like phenomena as well.
Practice and structure.
Samyama is practiced consistently by yogis of some yoga meditation systems and schools, from simple meditation alone to week-long meditation retreats or more.
Described in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, it comprises the three most mentally focusing "limbs" of Patanjali's Eight-limbed ("Astanga") in his Yoga Sutras.
A meditator who is successful in learning samyama vanquishes all cognitive obstacles/problems/troubles (Sanskrit: klesha).
The Sutras then describe various psychic experiences Patanjali calls "powers," "successes," or "perfections" (Sanskrit: siddhi) that a yoga meditator may experience through the conduit of Samyama.
Yoga Sutras.
Samyama is defined in the "Yoga Sutras" of Patanjali verses 3.1 through 3.6 as follows where the Sanskrit in Devanagari and IAST were sourced from Little and the English from Iyengar (1993: pp. 178–183): 
&lt;poem&gt; 
देशबन्धश्चित्तस्य धारणा ॥ १॥  
deśabandhaścittasya dhāraṇā .. 1..
Fixing the consciousness on one point or region is concentration (dhāraṇā).
तत्र प्रत्ययैकतानता ध्यानम् ॥ २॥  
tatra pratyayaikatānatā dhyānam .. 2..
A steady, continuous flow of attention directed towards the same point or region is meditation (dhyāna).
तद् एवार्थमात्रनिर्भासं स्वरूपशून्यम् इव समाधिः ॥ ३॥  
tad evārthamātranirbhāsaṃ svarūpaśūnyam iva samādhiḥ .. 3..
When the object of meditation engulfs the meditator, appearing as the subject, self-awareness is lost.
This is samādhi.
त्रयम् एकत्र संयमः ॥ ४॥  
trayam ekatra saṃyamaḥ .. 4..
These three together [dhāraṇā, dhyāna and samādhi] constitute "integration" or saṃyama.
तज्जयात् प्रज्ञालोकः ॥ ५॥  
tajjayāt prajñālokaḥ .. 5..
From mastery of saṃyama comes the light of awareness and insight.
तस्य भूमिषु विनियोगः ॥ ६॥  
tasya bhūmiṣu viniyogaḥ .. 6..
Saṃyama may be applied in various spheres to derive its usefulness.
&lt;/poem&gt;

All about Samyama 
Jesus Prayer 
The Jesus Prayer, also known as The Prayer, is a short formulaic prayer, esteemed and advocated especially in Eastern Christianity: "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner."
The prayer has been widely taught and discussed throughout the history of the Orthodox Church.
The ancient and original form did not include the words "a sinner", which were added later.
It is often repeated continually as a part of personal ascetic practice, its use being an integral part of the eremitic tradition of prayer known as hesychasm.
The prayer is particularly esteemed by the spiritual fathers of this tradition (see "Philokalia") as a method of cleaning and opening up the mind and after this the heart (), brought about first by the Prayer of the Mind, or more precisely the Noetic Prayer (), and after this the Prayer of the Heart ().
The "Prayer of the Heart" is considered to be the "Unceasing Prayer" that the Apostle Paul advocates in the New Testament.
Theophan the Recluse regarded the "Jesus Prayer" stronger than all other prayers by virtue of the power of the Holy Name of Jesus.
Though identified more closely with Eastern Christianity, the prayer is found in Western Christianity in the "Catechism of the Catholic Church".
It also is used in conjunction with the recent innovation of Anglican prayer beads.
The Eastern Orthodox theology of the Jesus Prayer as enunciated in the 14th century by Gregory Palamas was generally rejected by Latin Church theologians until the 20th century.
Pope John Paul II called Gregory Palamas a saint, a great writer, and an authority on theology.
He also spoke with appreciation of hesychasm as "that deep union of grace which Eastern theology likes to describe with the particularly powerful term "theosis", 'divinization, and likened the meditative quality of the Jesus Prayer to that of the Catholic Rosary.
Origins.
The prayer's origin is the Egyptian desert, which was settled by the monastic Desert Fathers and Desert Mothers in the 5th century.
It was found inscribed in the ruins of a cell from that period in the Egyptian desert.
A formula similar to the standard form of the Jesus Prayer is found in a letter attributed to John Chrysostom, who died in AD 407.
This "Letter to an Abbot" speaks of "Lord Jesus Christ, son of God, have mercy" and "Lord Jesus Christ, son of God, have mercy on us" being used as ceaseless prayer.
However, some consider this letter dubious or spurious and attribute it to an unknown writer of unknown date.
What may be the earliest explicit reference to the Jesus Prayer in a form that is similar to that used today is in "Discourse on Abba Philimon" from the "Philokalia".
Philimon lived around AD 600.
The version cited by Philimon is, "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy upon me," which is apparently the earliest source to cite this standard version.
While the prayer itself was in use by that time, John S. Romanides writes that "We are still searching the Fathers for the term 'Jesus prayer'."
A similar idea is recommended in the "Ladder of Divine Ascent" of John Climacus (circa 523–606), who recommends the regular practice of a "monologistos", or one-worded "Jesus Prayer".
The use of the Jesus Prayer according to the tradition of the "Philokalia" is the subject of the 19th century anonymous Russian spiritual classic "The Way of a Pilgrim", also in the original form, without the addition of the words "a sinner".
Though the Jesus Prayer has been practiced through the centuries as part of the Eastern tradition, in the 20th century, it also began to be used in some Western churches, including some Latin Catholic and Anglican churches.
Theology.
The hesychastic practice of the Jesus Prayer is founded on the biblical view by which God's name is conceived as the place of his presence.
Orthodox mysticism has no images or representations.
The mystical practice (the prayer and the meditation) doesn't lead to perceiving representations of God (see below Palamism).
Thus, the most important means of a life consecrated to praying is the invoked "name of God", as it is emphasized since the 5th century by the Thebaid anchorites, or by the later Athonite hesychasts.
For the Orthodox the power of the Jesus Prayer comes not only from its content, but from the very invocation of Jesus' name.
Scriptural roots.
The Jesus Prayer combines three Bible verses: the Christological hymn of the Pauline epistle Philippians (verse 11: "Jesus Christ is Lord"), the Annunciation of Luke (verse 35: "Son of God"), and the Parable of the Pharisee and the Publican of Luke , in which the Pharisee demonstrates the improper way to pray (verse 11: "God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican"), whereas the Publican prays correctly in humility (verse 13: "God be merciful to me a sinner").
Palamism, the underlying theology.
The essence–energies distinction, a central principle in Orthodox theology, was first formulated by Gregory of Nyssa and developed by Gregory Palamas in the 14th century in support of the mystical practices of Hesychasm and against Barlaam of Seminara.
It stands that God's "essence" (, "ousia") is distinct from God's "energies", his manifestations in the world, by which men can experience the Divine.
The energies are "unbegotten" or "uncreated".
They were revealed in various episodes of the Bible: the burning bush seen by Moses, the Light on Mount Tabor at the Transfiguration.
"Palamas […] taught that the ascetic endeavor of fasting and prayer, particularly the practice of the Jesus Prayer according to the teachings of the hesychastic Fathers, prepares one to receive the grace-filled light of the Lord, which is like that which shone on Mt. Tabor at the Lord's Transfiguration.
In other words, if God wills, according to one's striving, one can partake of divine blessedness while still on this sinful earth."
Apophatism (negative theology) is the main characteristic of the Eastern theological tradition.
Incognoscibility is not conceived as agnosticism or refusal to know God, because the Eastern theology is not concerned with abstract concepts; it is contemplative, with a discourse on things above rational understanding.
Therefore, dogmas are often expressed antinomically.
This form of contemplation is experience of God, illumination, called the vision of God or, in Greek, theoria.
For the Eastern Orthodox the knowledge or of the uncreated energies is usually linked to apophatism.
Repentance in Eastern Orthodoxy.
The Eastern Orthodox Church holds a non-juridical view of sin, by contrast to the satisfaction view of atonement for sin as articulated in the West, firstly by Anselm of Canterbury (as debt of honor)) and Thomas Aquinas (as a moral debt).
The terms used in the East are less legalistic ("grace", "punishment"), and more medical ("sickness", "healing") with less exacting precision.
Sin, therefore, does not carry with it the guilt for breaking a rule, but rather the impetus to become something more than what men usually are.
One repents not because one is or isn't virtuous, but because human nature can change.
Repentance (, "metanoia", "changing one's mind") isn't remorse, justification, or punishment, but a continual enactment of one's freedom, deriving from renewed choice and leading to restoration (the return to man's original state).
This is reflected in the Mystery of Confession for which, not being limited to a mere confession of sins and presupposing recommendations or penalties, it is primarily that the priest acts in his capacity of spiritual father.
The Mystery of Confession is linked to the spiritual development of the individual, and relates to the practice of choosing an elder to trust as his or her spiritual guide, turning to him for advice on the personal spiritual development, confessing sins, and asking advice.
As stated at the local Council of Constantinople in 1157, Christ brought his redemptive sacrifice not to the Father alone, but to the Trinity as a whole.
In the Eastern Orthodox theology redemption isn't seen as "ransom".
It is the "reconciliation" of God with man, the manifestation of God's love for humanity.
Thus, it is not the anger of God the Father but His love that lies behind the sacrificial death of his son on the cross.
The redemption of man is not considered to have taken place only in the past, but continues to this day through theosis.
The initiative belongs to God, but presupposes man's active acceptance (not an action only, but an attitude), which is a way of perpetually receiving God.
Distinctiveness from analogues in other religions.
The practice of contemplative or meditative chanting is known in several religions including Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam (e.g. japa, zikr).
The form of internal contemplation involving profound inner transformations affecting all the levels of the self is common to the traditions that posit the ontological value of personhood.
The history of these practices, including their possible spread from one religion to another, is not well understood.
Such parallels (like between unusual psycho-spiritual experiences, breathing practices, postures, spiritual guidances of elders, peril warnings) might easily have arisen independently of one another, and in any case must be considered within their particular religious frameworks.
Although some aspects of the Jesus Prayer may resemble some aspects of other traditions, its Christian character is central rather than mere "local color".
The aim of the Christian practicing it is not limited to attaining humility, love, or purification of sinful thoughts, but rather it is becoming holy and seeking union with God ("theosis"), which subsumes all the aforementioned virtues.
Thus, for the Eastern Orthodox: 
A magistral way of meeting God for the Orthodox, the Jesus Prayer does not harbor any secrets in itself, nor does its practice reveal any esoteric truths.
Instead, as a hesychastic practice, it demands setting the mind apart from rational activities and ignoring the physical senses for the experiential knowledge of God.
It stands along with the regular expected actions of the believer (prayer, almsgiving, repentance, fasting etc.) as the response of the Orthodox Tradition to Paul the Apostle's challenge to "pray without ceasing" ().
It is also linked to the Song of Solomon's passage from the Old Testament: "I sleep, but my heart is awake" (Song of Solomon 5:2).
The analogy being that as a lover is always conscious to his or her beloved, people can also achieve a state of "constant prayer" where they are always conscious of God's presence in their lives.
Practice.
The practice of the Jesus Prayer is integrated into the mental, physical and spiritual ascesis undertaken by the Orthodox monastic in the practice of hesychasm.
Yet the Jesus Prayer is not limited only to monastic life or to clergy.
Anyone may practice this prayer, laypeople and clergy, men, women and children.
In the Eastern tradition the prayer is said or prayed repeatedly, often with the aid of a prayer rope (; ), which is a cord, usually from wool or silk, tied with many knots.
The prayer ropes usually have 33, 50, 100 or 300 knots – or, more generally, an easily divisible number.
The person saying the prayer says one repetition for each knot.
It may be accompanied by prostrations and the sign of the cross, signaled by beads strung along the prayer rope at intervals.
The prayer rope is "a tool of prayer" and an aid to beginners or those who face difficulties practicing the Prayer.
However even the most advanced practitioners still use prayer ropes.
The Jesus Prayer may be practiced under the guidance and supervision of a spiritual guide (pneumatikos, ), and or Starets, especially when psychosomatic techniques (like rhythmical breath) are incorporated.
A person that acts as a spiritual "father" and advisor may be an official certified by the Church Confessor (Pneumatikos Exolmologitis) or sometimes a spiritually experienced monk (called in Greek Gerontas (Elder) or in Russian Starets).
It is possible for that person to be a layperson, usually a "practical theologician" (i.e. a person well versed in Orthodox theology but without official credentials, certificates, diplomas etc.).
Techniques.
There are no fixed rules for those who pray, "the way there is no mechanical, physical or mental technique which can force God to show his presence" (Metropolitan Kallistos Ware).
In "The Way of a Pilgrim", the pilgrim advises, "as you draw your breath in, say, or imagine yourself saying, 'Lord Jesus Christ,' and as you breathe again, 'have mercy on me.'"
Another option is to say (orally or mentally) the whole prayer while breathing in and again the whole prayer while breathing out and yet another, to breathe in recite the whole prayer, breathe out while reciting the whole prayer again.
One can also hold the breath for a few seconds between breathing in and out.
Monks may pray this prayer many hundreds of times each night as part of their private cell vigil ("cell rule").
Under the guidance of an Elder (Russian "Starets"; Greek "Gerondas"), the monk aims to internalize the prayer, so that he is praying unceasingly.
Diadochos of Photiki refers in "On Spiritual Knowledge and Discrimination" to the automatic repetition of the Jesus Prayer, under the influence of the Holy Spirit, even in sleep.
This state is regarded as the accomplishment of Paul the Apostle's exhortation to the Thessalonians to "pray without ceasing" ().
The Jesus Prayer can be used for a kind of "psychological" self-analysis.
According to the "Way of the Pilgrim" account and Mount Athos practitioners of the Jesus Prayer, "one can have some insight on his or her current psychological situation by observing the intonation of the words of the prayer, as they are recited.
Which word is stressed most.
This self-analysis could reveal to the praying person things about their inner state and feelings, maybe not yet realised, of their unconsciousness."
"While praying the Jesus Prayer, one might notice that sometimes the word 'Lord' is pronounced louder, more stressed, than the others, like: "Lord" Jesus Christ, (Son of God), have mercy on me, (a/the sinner).
In this case, they say, it means that our inner self is currently more aware of the fact that Jesus is the Lord, maybe because we need reassurance that he is in control of everything (and our lives too).
Other times, the stressed word is 'Jesus': Lord "Jesus" Christ, (Son of God), have mercy on me, (a/the sinner).
In that case, they say, we feel the need to personally appeal more to his human nature, the one that is more likely to understand our human problems and shortcomings, maybe because we are going through tough personal situations.
Likewise if the word 'Christ' is stressed it could be that we need to appeal to Jesus as Messiah and Mediator, between humans and God the Father, and so on.
When the word 'Son' is stressed maybe we recognise more Jesus' relationship with the Father.
If 'of God' is stressed then we could realise more Jesus' unity with the Father.
A stressed 'have mercy on me' shows a specific, or urgent, need for mercy.
A stressed 'a sinner' (or 'the sinner') could mean that there is a particular current realisation of the sinful human nature or a particular need for forgiveness.
"In order to do this kind of self-analysis one should better start reciting the prayer relaxed and naturally for a few minutes so the observation won't be consciously 'forced', and then to start paying attention to the intonation as described above.
Also, a person might want to consciously stress one of the words of the prayer in particular when one wants to express a conscious feeling of situation.
So in times of need stressing the 'have mercy' part can be more comforting or more appropriate.
In times of failures, the 'a sinner' part, etc...)."
Levels of the prayer.
Paul Evdokimov, a 20th-century Russian philosopher and theologian, writes about beginner's way of praying: initially, the prayer is excited because the man is emotive and a flow of psychic contents is expressed.
In his view this condition comes, for the modern men, from the separation of the mind from the heart: "The prattle spreads the soul, while the silence is drawing it together."
Old fathers condemned elaborate phraseologies, for one word was enough for the publican, and one word saved the thief on the cross.
They only uttered Jesus' name by which they were contemplating God.
For Evdokimov the acting faith denies any formalism which quickly installs in the external prayer or in the life duties; he quotes Seraphim of Sarov: "The prayer is not thorough if the man is self-conscious and he is aware he's praying."
"Because the prayer is a living reality, a deeply personal encounter with the living God, it is not to be confined to any given classification or rigid analysis" an on-line catechism reads.
As general guidelines for the practitioner, different number of levels (3, 7 or 9) in the practice of the prayer are distinguished by Orthodox fathers.
They are to be seen as being purely informative, because the practice of the Prayer of the Heart is learned under personal spiritual guidance in Eastern Orthodoxy which emphasizes the perils of temptations when it's done by one's own.
Thus, Theophan the Recluse, a 19th-century Russian spiritual writer, talks about three stages: 
Once this is achieved the Jesus Prayer is said to become "self-active" ().
It is repeated automatically and unconsciously by the mind, becoming an internal habit like a (beneficial) earworm.
Body, through the uttering of the prayer, mind, through the mental repetition of the prayer, are thus unified with "the heart" (spirit) and the prayer becomes constant, ceaselessly "playing" in the background of the mind, like a background music, without hindering the normal everyday activities of the person.
More exactly, according with the experience of the ones which had reached at the level of unceasing prayer - for example the monks from Mount Athos but not only, this can be further divided in the Prayer of the Mind - level at which the prayer is said unceasingly in the rational parts (intellect - also called mind - and logic) of the soul and, if the practitioner advances further, then the grace will unite the rational parts with the irrational parts of the soul (inflammatory part and appetitive part) and then the prayer is called The Prayer of the Heart.
Others, like Father Archimandrite Ilie Cleopa, one of the most representative spiritual fathers of contemporary Romanian Orthodox monastic spirituality, talk about nine levels (see External links).
They are the same path to theosis, more slenderly differentiated: 
In its more advanced use, the monk aims to attain to a sober practice of the Jesus Prayer in the heart free of images.
It is from this condition, called by John Climacus and Hesychios the "guard of the mind", that the monk is raised by the divine grace to contemplation.
Variants of repetitive formulas.
A number of different repetitive prayer formulas have been attested in the history of Eastern Orthodox monasticism: the Prayer of St. Ioannikios the Great (754–846): "My hope is the Father, my refuge is the Son, my shelter is the Holy Ghost, O Holy Trinity, Glory unto You," the repetitive use of which is described in his "Life"; or the more recent practice of Nikolaj Velimirović.
Similarly to the flexibility of the practice of the Jesus Prayer, there is no imposed standardization of its form.
The prayer can be from as short as "Lord, have mercy" (Kyrie eleison), "Have mercy on me" ("Have mercy upon us"), or even "Jesus", to its longer most common form.
It can also contain a call to the Theotokos (Virgin Mary), or to the saints.
The single essential and invariable element is Jesus' name.
In art.
The Jesus Prayer is a core part of the plot in J. D. Salinger's pair of stories "Franny and Zooey".
Its use in that book is itself referenced in Jeffrey Eugenides's novel, The Marriage Plot.
The prayer is also a central theme of the 2006 Russian film "Ostrov".
In 1999, Sir John Tavener wrote this haunting and somewhat discordant setting of ‘The Jesus Prayer’ for the popular Icelandic singer Björk.
His song is titled ‘Prayer of the Heart’ which is an alternate name for ‘The Jesus Prayer.’
The music is played by the Brodsky Quartet.
The Jesus Prayer repeats in Greek, in Coptic (the language of the desert fathers and mothers), and in English.
Catholic Church.
Part four of the "Catechism of the Catholic Church", which is dedicated to Christian prayer, devotes paragraphs 2665 to 2669 to prayer to Jesus.
In his poem "The Book of the Twelve Béguines", John of Ruysbroeck, a 14th-century Flemish mystic beatified by Pope Pius X in 1908, wrote of "the uncreated Light, which is not God, but is the intermediary between Him and the 'seeing thought'" as illuminating the contemplative not in the highest mode of contemplation, but in the second of the four ascending modes.
Similar methods of prayer in use in the Catholic Church are recitation, as recommended by John Cassian, of "O God, come to my assistance; O Lord, make haste to help me" or other verses of Scripture; repetition of a single monosyllabic word, as suggested by the Cloud of Unknowing; the method used in Centering Prayer; the method used by The World Community for Christian Meditation, based on the Aramaic invocation "Maranatha"; the use of Lectio Divina; etc. 
The "Catechism of the Catholic Church" says: 
Use by other Christians.
In addition to Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox, many Christians of other traditions also use the Jesus Prayer, primarily as a centering prayer or for contemplative prayer.
The prayer is sometimes used with the Anglican rosary.
The structure and content of the Jesus Prayer also bears a resemblance to the "Sinner's Prayer" used by many evangelical Protestants.
Daoyin 
Daoyin is a series of cognitive body and mind unity exercises practiced as a form of Daoist neigong, meditation and mindfulness to cultivate "jing" (essence) and direct and refine "qi", the internal energy of the body according to Traditional Chinese medicine.
These exercises are often divided into yin positions, lying and sitting, and yang positions, standing and moving.
The practice of daoyin was a precursor of qigong, and was practised in Chinese Taoist monasteries for health and spiritual cultivation.
Daoyin is also said to be a primary formative ingredient in the well-known "soft styles" of the Chinese martial arts, of Taiji quan. and middle road styles like Wuxingheqidao.
The main goal of "daoyin" is to create flexibility of the mind therefore creating harmony between internal and external environments, which relaxes, replenishes and rejuvenates the body, developing in its practitioners a vital and healthy spirit.
In the West, "daoyin" is sometimes mistakenly equated with "daoist yoga" or "yin yoga" as ""dao" () and "yin"" () are mistakenly read as "Dao" (), as in "Daoism", and "Yin" (), as in "Yin-Yang".
The Daoyin Tu. 
A painted scroll on display at the Hunan Provincial Museum and known as the Daoyin Tu found in tomb three at Mawangdui in 1973 and dated to 168 BC shows coloured drawings of 44 figures in standing and sitting postures performing daoyin exercises.
It is the earliest physical exercise chart in the world so far, and illustrates a medical system which does not rely on external factors such as medication, surgery or treatments, but utilizes solely internal factors to prevent disease.
The images include men and women, young and old.
Their postures and movements differ from one another.
Some are sitting, some are standing, and still others are practicing Daoyintu or exercising using apparatuses.
Translation of the texts covering the document show that the early Chinese were aware of the need for both preventive and corrective breathing exercises.
The exercises can be divided into three categories: 
Effects.
A typical daoyin exercise will involve movement of the arms and body in time with controlled inhalation and exhalation.
Each exercise is designed with a different goal in mind, for example calmative effects or expanded lung capacity.
According to Mantak Chia the practice of daoyin has the following effects: harmonization of the qi, relaxation of the abdominal muscles and the diaphragm, training of the "second brain" in the lower abdomen, improvement of health and structural alignment.

Sandhyavandanam 
Sandhyavandanam (Sanskrit: , "", lit. 'salutation to (Goddess) Twilight' or 'salutation during the twilight')  
is a mandatory religious ritual centring around the recitation of the Gayatri mantra, traditionally supposed to be performed three times a day by "Dvija" communities of Hindus, particularly those initiated through the sacred thread ceremony referred to as the Upanayanam and instructed in its execution by a "Guru", in this case one qualified to teach Vedic ritual.
Sandhyopasana is considered as a path to attain salvation (moksha).
Practice of Sandhyā in Ramayana and Mahabharata by Rama and Krishna can be observed.
In Balakanda (23.2, 23.2) of Ramayana, Viswamitra wakes Rama and Lakshmana up at the break of the dawn for the worship of sandhyā.
In Udyogaparva (82.21) of Mahabharata there is reference to Krishna performing Sandhya.
Definition of Sandhyā.
Sir Monier-Williams translated as twilight (i.e. the period between night and day), as well as "the religious acts performed by Brahmans and twice-born men at the above three divisions of the day".
The Sandhyāvandanam consists of ritual recitation from the Vedas.
These rituals are performed three times a day - at morning ('), noon (') and evening (").
The Gayatri mantra.
The Gayatri mantra, the central mantra of the Sandhyavandanam, has 24 syllables: 
Stephanie W. Jamison and Joel P. Brereton translated the mantra as, "Might we make our own that desirable effulgence of god Savitar, who will rouse forth our insights."
Sandhyākāla.
Sandhyākāla is also defined as the "time to perform Sandhyā".
Traditionally, the day is divided by 5 parts, each having an interval of 2 hour and 24 minutes.
They are "prātaḥ-kālaḥ" (early morning), "pūrvahna" (forenoon), "madhyāhna" (around noon), "aparāhna" (afternoon), "sāyāhna" (evening).
As per Hindu traditional calendar, the day which starts with sunrise (i.e. from midnight of previous night until sunrise is considered part of previous day).
A Sandhyākāla is 72 minutes (i.e. 3 ghaṭīs of 24 minutes).
Direction of Sandhyāvandanam.
The Sandhyāvandanam is traditionally done facing the east in the morning sandhyā (doing Gāyatrījapa until sunrise), the north in the noon and the west in the evening sandhyā (doing Gāyatrījapa until stars rise).
In the evening, only "āchamana" part is performed in east or north.
Parts of Sandhyā Vandanam.
As per the work Sandhyātattvasubhodini, the "Sāṅgopāṅga Sandhyāvandanam" (lit.
Sandhyāvandanam with all the essential and subsidiary parts) consists of different components termed as aṅgas (lit. limbs).
Apart from the principal "aṅgi" it has 5 anterior parts (pūrvāṅga) and 5 posterior parts (uttarāṅga).
Before commencement of the 5 pūrvāṅgas, there are 3 angas: Ācamanaṃ (आचमनम्), Prāṇāyāmaḥ (प्राणायामः) and Sankalpaḥ (सङ्कल्पः), which are not mentioned separately.
These 5 pūrvāṅgas are: 
The principal part is the Sandhyopāsanā mantram (सन्ध्योपासना मन्त्रम्), which involves contemplation on Brahman, referred as 'Brahmabhāvanam'.
This Upāsanā mantra is also referred as Dhyānam part in Sandhyāvandanam by the smritis.
However, few smritis such as by Manu and Āśvalāyana consider Gāyatrījapaḥ as the principle one.
The 5 "uttarāṅgas" are: 
In addition to the above Vedic components of the Sandhyāvandanam, many include the following due to Tantric influences: 
Accessories for Sandhyā.
Pañcapātra.
A Pañcapātra is the set of holy utensils used for Hindu rituals containing plate ("thāḷī, laghupātra") and ritualistic spoon ("uddhariṇī"/"ācamanī").
Āsana.
As per vyāsa and parāśara, a seat ("Āsana") for japa is traditionally made of silk ("kauśeya") or blanket ("kambala") or skin ("ajina") or wood ("dāruja") or (palm) leaves (tālapatra).
Hindu texts cite various spiritual and material benefits or drawbacks depending on different materials used for the seat.
Japamāla.
A Japamāla is often used for counting the number of recitations in Gayatri japa.
An Āsanamantra typically chanted before taking seat.
Tilakadhāraṇa.
The Tilakadhāraṇa is a holy mark (Tilaka) made on the forehead as per the local tradition before commencement of Sandhyā.
"Kumkuma", "gandha", "gopichandana" and "bhasma" are often used for marking.
Saivaites and Smartas mark tripuṇḍram, while, vaishnavaites mark ūrdhvapuṇḍram.
"Tripuṇḍram" (Sanskrit:त्रिपुण्ड्रम्) or Tripuṇḍraka refers to the “three parallel lines of ash marks over the forehead”, according to the Śivapurāṇa 1.18.
"Ūrddhvapuṇḍram" (ऊर्द्ध्वपुण्ड्रम्) is a perpendicular line on the forehead made with Sandal, &amp;c. a Vaishnava mark.
Traditional authorities strictly advised against doing Sandhyā without tilakadhāraṇa.
Upavītam.
The yajñopavītam (Sanskrit: यज्ञोपवीतम्, sacred thread) worn as upavīta (i.e. in the proper manner of wearing it from over the left shoulder and under the right arm) is cited as a necessity for performing the Sandhyavandanam.
Yajurveda Sandhyāvandanam.
It is usual practice to recite mantras from one's own Veda in Sandhyāvandanam.
The procedure below are given taken from the Taittirīya śākha of (Kriṣna) Yajurveda as followed by Telugu people adhering to the smarta tradition.
The mantras used in "Prāṇāyāma, Mantrācamana, Gāyatrī āhvānam, Devatānamaskāraḥ" and "Gāyatrī Prasthānam" are directly from Mahanarayana Upanishad (Andhra rescension containing 80 anuvakas).
Mānasasnānam.
Sandhyāvandanam starts with mānasasnānam (lit. mind bath) that involves "viṣṇusmaraṇaṃ" (remembrance of Vishnu): 
By uttering the above chant, water is sprinkled on head three times.
Ācamana.
Achamana involves sipping of water three times without thinking of the self in any way, but meditating on the ‘Supreme Atman”.
Achamana is done only in two directions, the East or North.
There are three types of Āchamanam, namely, Śrautācamanam (Sanskrit: ), Smṛtyācamanam (Sanskrit: ) and Purāṇācamanam (Sanskrit: ).
Since, this is the first āchamana in Sandhyāvandanam, the sipping of water should be Purāṇācamana (i.e. 24 names of Vishnu starting with Om Keśavāya swāha &amp; Co).
Then, one Smṛtyācāmana and Bhūtocchāṭana are performed.
Prāṇāyāma.
Prāṇāyāma refers to the practice of controlled breathing in meditation.
It consists of three processes, first is "inhalation" that involves breathing in slowly through the right nostril; called as pūraka (पूरकः).
The second is "retention" that involves retaining the breath by closing both nostrils, for a period more or less prolonged; called as kumbhaka (कुम्भक).
As per Yajnavalkya smriti, the Gayatri mantra with its "śiras" (head) and preceded by the 7 "vyāhṛtīs"; to each of which the syllable Om should be added.
This chanting has to be done thrice during kumbhaka.
Then, the third is "exhalation" that involves breathing out slowly through the other nostril; called as recaka (रेचकः).
Sankalpa.
Sankalpa means taking the resolve.
Then, Jalābhimantraṇam is done while reciting the Gayatri mantra to purify the water just before "Prathama Mārjana".
Prathama Mārjana.
"Marjanam" is also known as "Mantrasnānam" (bath with mantras).
Mantras commonly used here praise water as a source of nourishment, medicines and energy.
Mantrācamana.
Mantrācamanaṃ or Jalaprāśanaṃ is sipping of water by reciting relevant Vedic mantras for internal purification in order to perform ritual acts.
One offers water consecrated by mantras in the fire present in the mouth – contemplating that body, mind and heart have been cleansed.
Sins specified include: Mental, i.e. evil thoughts, anger, Oral, i.e. lies, abuses and Physical, i.e. theft, prohibited sexual act, consuming undesirable food, crushing creatures under the feet.
Seek emancipation of sins committed during the day or night.
Punarmārjana.
Smṛtyācāmana is performed two times.
Then the Punarmārjanaṃ, or second cleansing is done.
Aghamarṣaṇaṃ.
Aghamarṣaṇaṃ is intended to liberate from sins with a few drops of water in the hand, chant the related mantra and mentally induce 'Pāpapuruṣa' to come out through the nose into the water and it is throw it away to the left side.
In Yajurveda sandhya, the meaning of mantra is 
Arghyapradāna.
One Smṛtyācāmana and one Prāṇāyāma are performed.
Then, "arghyapradāna" means offering of water to the Sun with two hands as laid down in the Grihyasutras.
A handful of water is taken in two hands cupped together, standing in front of the Sun.
Then recite the Sāvitri (i.e. Gayatri mantra) preceded by the vyāhṛtis and the pranava (i.e. om kāra).
Arghya has to be offered thrice.
These three arghyas destroy the mandeha rakshasas fighting the Sun every sandhya..
If there is delay in sandhya by exceeding the sandhya time, then Prāyaścitta arghya (i.e. fourth one) is given.
Sandhyopāsanā (Dhyāna).
The sun is then contemplated as the brahman (i.e.the supreme reality) through the mantra asā'vādityo brahmā (Sanskrit:असाऽवादित्यो ब्रह्मा, lit. this Āditya is indeed the "Brahman").
Smartas who adhere to advaita utter additional verse "So'ham asmi.
Aham brahmāsmi."
(Sanskrit:सोऽहमस्मि। अहं ब्रह्मास्मि॥, lit. "this is I".
"I am Brahman").
Tarpaṇaṃ.
Then, two times Smṛtyācāmana and three times Prāṇāyāma are performed.
Tarpana is a term in the Vedic practice which refers to an offering made to divine entities, where some water is taken in the right hand and poured over the straightened fingers.
In Sandhyā, Four devatarpaṇas are offered for Sandhyā devata.
Gāyatrī āhvānam.
In Gāyatrī āhvānam (lit. invitation of Gāyatrī), the Sandhyādevata is invited by relevant Vedic mantras.
One Śrautācāmana and one Prāṇāyāma are performed.
Then "Gāyatrī japa sankalpa" is told.
Nyāsa.
In nyāsa mental appropriation or assignment of various parts of the body to tutelary deities is done just before and after Gāyatrī japam.
There are two nyāsas, karanyāsa and aṅganyāsa that involves "ritualistic placing of the finger over the different parts of the body as prescribed" with related ancillary mantras.
When done before japa, aṅganyāsa ends with the utterance "digbandhaḥ" (invoking protection from eight cardinals) and when done after, it ends with the utterance "digvimokaḥ" (releasing the protection).
Then, Gāyatrīdhyāna mantra is uttered.
Mudrāpradarśanam.
Mudrāpradarśana is showing different mudras before and after the japa.
These mudras are to be shown just after nyāsa.
The mudras in Sandhyāvandanam are 32 in number, where 24 are pūrva mudras shown before the japa and the remaining 8 are shown after it.
After showing 24 mudras, the following sloka that emphasizes on showing mudras is to be uttered: 
Gāyatrī mantra (Japa).
Just before the japa, the Gāyatrī mantrārtha śloka that gives the meaning of Gayatri mantra is uttered.
The Gayatri mantra is chanted either 1008, 108, 54, 28 or at least 10 times using some "japamāla" or even "karamāla".
Meditation upon the solar deity is done.
He is considered the absolute reality (i.e. Parabrahman) settled in the lotus heart ("hṛtpadma") of all beings.
The counting should be made on the right hand which should be covered with a cloth.
There are 3 ways of doing a Japa, namely, vācika, where the mantra is pronounced clearly and aloud, upāmśu, where the lips move quietly and only the meditator hears the mantra and mānasa (or mānasika), purely mental recitation of the mantra.
Gāyatrī japāvasānam.
One Śrautācāmana and one Prāṇāyāma are performed.
Then "Gāyatrī japāvasāna sankalpa" is told.
Then, "nyasa" is again performed; this time ending with the utterance "digvimokaḥ" and "Gāyatrīdhyāna mantra" is uttered.
After that the remaining 8 uttara mudras are shown.
Then, the fruit of japa is offered to Brahman by uttering Om tat sat brahmārpaṇam astu (Sanskrit:ॐ तत्सत् ब्रह्मार्पणमस्तु, lit.
That is truth; (fruit of japa) offered to Brahman).
Sūryopasthānaṃ.
One Smṛtyācāmana and three times Prāṇāyāma are performed.
In upasthānaṃ, some mantras related to Mitra (in the morning), Surya (in the solar noon) and Varuna (in the evening) are chanted by standing and facing towards sun.
In the morning face east, in the noon face north and in the evening face west.
Digdevata vandanam.
Digdevata vandanam or Dik Namaskāraḥ involves prayers to the lords of the cardinal directions, Indra, Agni, Yama, Nirutha, Varuna, Vayu, Soma, Eeashana, Brahma and Vishnu.
They are witnesses to all our deeds.
The ideals represented by each of them will provide a direction to us in our march ahead.
Then, Munina maskāraḥ and Devatā namaskāraḥ are performed, where salutations to the munis and devatas.
Among smartas, additionally, Hariharābheda smaraṇam is done by smartas to contemplate on the oneness of Siva and Vishnu.
Gāyatrī Prasthānam.
Gāyatrī Prasthānam or "Udvāsana" involves bidding farewell to the Sandhyādevata by relevant Vedic mantras.
Nārāyaṇābhivandanam.
Lord Nārayaṇa is hailed by chanting relevant mantra.
Bhūmyākāśa ābhivandanam.
The Sky (Dyaus Pitṛ) and the Earth (Pṛthivī) are offered salutations by considering them as parents by Sāṣṭāṅga Namaskāra with relevant Vedic mantras from "Taittiriya Brahamana".
Iśvara Prārthanā.
Lord Vāsudeva (i.e. Krishna) is hailed by chanting relevant mantras.
Abhivādanam.
It is formal salutation by reciting one's Gotra and Pravara.
It is also an expression of gratitude to the teachers (Rishis) for transmitting divine wisdom to the next generation.
It is customary to mention the name, gotra, pravara, adhered dharmasutra (of Kalpa) and the Veda followed along with its "śakha" (recension).
A typical abhivādana(recitation of pravara) of a Yajuevedin is as follows 
In the above abhivādana, Kshatriyas and Vyshyas replace "śarmā" with varmā and guptā respectively.
Samarpaṇam.
One Purāṇācamana and one Smṛtyācāmana are performed.
Then, Samarpaṇam is done to note that the entire process was undertaken with an intent to please Him as per His directions.
The fruits of such act are also placed at His disposal.
He distributes them equitably.
A philosophy of total surrender to Him is embedded here.
This can only mollify our pride and implant humility.
Kṣamāpaṇam.
Finally, Kṣamāpaṇam (lit. begging pardon (from the God)) is done to seek pardon for acts of omission / error that might have been committed by chanting three of His names thrice.Even with best of intentions and utmost care, inadequacies can creep in.
It pays to look back, correct mistakes and strive to improvise.
Daily duties of Brahmins.
Doing Sandhya-vandana first creates the eligibility for a Brahmin to do all rituals following it.
Rituals done without doing sandhya-vandanam are regarded as fruitless by Dharmaśāstra.
Thus, sandhyavandanam forms the basis or regarded as the foundation for all other vedic rituals.
After doing Sandhyavandanam ( mādhyāhnika-sandhyā ) to get rid off sins occurred due preparation of lunch like boiling rice, cutting vegetables, burning firewood etc.
In Vaishvadeva homa rice cakes are offered to vishvadevas (all devatas).
As per Śāṅkhāyana-gṛhya-sūtra Adhyāya II, Khaṇḍa 9, a person should go in the forest, with a piece of wood in his hand, seated, he performs the Sandhyā (twilight/dusk?) constantly, observing silence, turning his face north-west, to the region between the chief (west) point and the intermediate (north-western) point (of the horizon), until the stars appear and by murmuring the Mahāvyāhṛtis, the Sāvitrī, and the auspicious hymns when (Sandhya-dusk?) passed.
In the same way during dawn, turning his face to the east, standing, until the disk of the sun appears.
And when (the sun) has risen, the study (of the Veda) goes on.
Miscellaneous.
Other aspects of the ritual, though, speaking strictly, not included in Sandhyavandanam, may include meditation, chanting of other mantras (Sanskrit: "japa"), and devotional practices specifically for divinities that are preferred by the practitioner.
Regarding the connection with meditation practices, Monier-Williams notes that if regarded as an act of meditation, the ' may be connected with the etymology '.
Depending on the beliefs — Smartha, Sri Vaishnava, Madhva — these mantras or procedures have slight changes, while the main mantras like mārjanaṃ (sprinkling of water), prāśanaṃ (drinking water), punar-mārjanaṃ and arghya-pradānaṃ remain the same in 95% of the cases.
Smārtas (Advaitins) have aikyānu-Sandhānam, where they (Yajur Vedins) recite the verse from bṛhadāraṇyaka Upanishad ( brahmair vāhaṃ asmi ).
Sivaprasad Bhattacharya defines it as the "Hindu code of liturgical prayers."
Asahi Health 
Asahi (or "Asahi Health") is a Finnish health exercise based on the eastern traditions of T'ai chi ch'uan, qigong, yiquan and yoga, with a western scientific viewpoint.
Asahi is designed to suit everybody, regardless of physical condition or age and education level.
Asahi exercise is taught and performed in instructed groups, but Asahi can also be performed alone as a form of daily self-treatment and build.
Asahi exercise is ideal for short breaks.
This exercise is equally effective in a group or alone as pleases.
The History of Asahi.
Asahi was created in Finland 2004 by professional sports instructors and martial artists Timo Klemola, Ilpo Jalamo, Keijo Mikkonen and Yrjö Mähönen.
They all had high regards towards classical body development techniques such as karate, T'ai chi ch'uan, yiquan and yoga, but these styles, as rewarding as they are, seemed to attract only a small marginal of the Finnish population.
These classical styles are quite complex and therefore may have a high starting level.
They use concepts such as qi and prana, which may seem mystical to western people.
The purpose of Asahi was to get the best out of these techniques, put it in the most simplified form, make it overall scientific and turn it into an easily approachable form - a health exercise for everybody with no starting level at all.
Asahi is designed to treat and prevent shoulder- and back problems, fractures due to falling down and stress-related psychosomatic problems.
The Principles of Asahi.
Asahi is a series of slow movements, completed in silence.
It looks harmonious and beautiful, a bit like qigong.
The basic six principles of Asahi are: 
1.
The linking of movement and breath 
2.
Practicing vertically erect body alignment 
3.
Whole body movement 
4.
Listening to the slow motion 
5.
Cultivating the mind with mental images 
6.
The exercise as a continual, flowing experience 
The Asahi movements are soft and performed in the rhythm of breathing.
The series is simple and easy to learn.
The movements have also a practical function, for example picking up a ball from the floor or improving one’s balance by standing on one foot.
Advanced levels are designed for long-term trainees, yet they are equally simple to learn.
Distribution.
Asahi can be practiced in major areas of Finland.
Asahi Health Ltd has also been accepted as an Education Partner to Federation of International Sports, Aerobics and Fitness as the first Body Mind -product to be recognized and recommended by this organization.
These exercises can be done by a teacher guiding a class, or through video instruction.
Vitarka-vicāra 
In Buddhism, vitarka (; ; ), "applied thought,"(initial) inquiry," and vicāra ( and ; ), "investigating what has been focused on by "vitakka", are qualities or elements of the first "dhyāna" or "jhāna".
In the Pali canon, "Vitakka-vicāra" form one expression, which refers to directing one's thought or attention on an object ("vitarka") and investigating it ("vicāra"), "breaking it down into its functional components" to understand it [and] distinguishing the multitude of conditioning factors implicated in a phenomenal event."
The later Theravada commentarial tradition, as represented by Buddhaghosa's Visuddhimagga, interprets "vitarka" and "vicāra" as the initial and sustained application of attention to a meditational object, which culminates in the stilling of the mind.
According to Fox and Bucknell "vitarka-vicāra" may also refer to "the normal process of discursive thought," which is quieted through absorption in the second "jhāna".
Etymology.
"Vitarka" (Sanskrit: वितर्क ) - "thoughts," "applied thought," "applied attention," "inquiry," "initial inquiry," "initial mental application, or initial intellectual investigative intent."
Its roots are: 
"Vitarka" may refer to mental activities that are manifest both in normal consciousness and in the first stage of "dhyana".
According to Buswel and Lopez, in general, it means "thought," "applied thought," or "distracted thoughts."
According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, "In the Suttas, the word Vittaka is often used in the loose sense of thought, but in the Abhidhamma it is used in a precise technical sense to mean the mental factor that mounts or directs the mind towards an object."
"Vicāra" (Sanskrit: विचार) - "investigation," "subsequent discursive reasoning and thought, i.e., investigating what has been focused on by "vitakka"."
Its roots are: 
"Vitarka" investigates things roughly, while "vicāra" investigates things exactly.
According to Dan Lusthaus, it is 
Mental factors in meditation.
"Vitarka" and "vicāra" are two of the mental factors ("cetasika") present during the first "dhyāna" (Pali: "jhāna"), and which are absent in the higher jhanas.
According to Shankman, "two distinct meanings are suggested [...] one indicating mental activities such as thinking, reflecting, and so on, and the other referring to the mental activity of connecting and sustaining the attention on a meditation object."
Investigation.
According to Dan Lusthaus, "vitarka-vicāra" is analytic scrutiny, a form of "prajna".
It "involves focusing on [something] and then breaking it down into its functional components" to understand it, "distinguishing the multitude of conditioning factors implicated in a phenomenal event."
According to Polak, in the Pali Canon "vitarka" and "vicāra" are mostly related to thinking about the sense-impressions, which give rise to further egoistical thought and action.
The stilling of this thinking fits into the Buddhist training of sense-withdrawal and right effort, culminating in the equanimity and mindfulness of "dhyana"-practice.
Ulrich Timme Kragh explains vitarka (discernment) and vicāra (discursiveness), as understood by the "Yogācārabhūmi-Śāstra," thus: discernment is "the cognitive operation that is responsible for ascertaining what is perceived by the senses by initially labeling it with a name", while discursiveness is "the subsequent conceptual operation of deciding whether the perceived sense-object is desirable and what course of action one might want to take in relation to it".
According to Chaicen, "Samadhi with general examination and specific in-depth investigation means getting rid of the not virtuous dharmas, such as greedy desire and hatred, to stay in joy and pleasure caused by nonarising, and to enter the first meditation and fully dwell in it."
Commentatorial tradition.
According to Stuart-Fox, the Abhidhamma separated "vitarka" from "vicāra", and "ekaggatā" (onepointedness) was added to the description first "jhāna" to give an equal number of five hindrances and five antidotes.
The commentarial tradition regards the qualities of the first "jhāna" to be antidotes to the five hindrances, and "ekaggatā" may have been added to the first "jhāna" to give exactly five anti-dotes for the five hindrances.
While initially simply referring to thought, which is present at the onset of "dhyāna", the terms "vitarka" and "vicāra" were re-interpreted by the developing Abhidharma and commentarial tradition.
In Theravāda, "vitarka" is one of the mental factors that apprehend the quality of an object.
It is the "initial application of attention" or the mind to its object, while "vicāra" is the sustained application of the mind on an object.
"Vitarka" is regarded in the Theravāda tradition as an antidote for "thina-middha" (sloth and torpor), one of the five hindrances.
Normal process of discursive thought.
According to Roderick S. Bucknell, ""vitakka-vicāra", the factor that particularly characterizes the first jhāna, is probably nothing other than the normal process of discursive thought, the familiar but usually unnoticed stream of mental imagery and verbalization".
Martin Stuart-Fox explains, referring to Rhys Davids and Stede, when "vitarka-vicāra" are mentioned in tandem, they are one expression, "to cover "all" varieties of thinking, including sustained and focused thought.
It is thinking in this inclusive sense that the meditator suppresses through concentration when he attains one-ness of mind and thus moves from first to second "jhāna"".
Yogacara.
The Yogacara term "manas" means both "intentionality" or 'self-centered thinking', and "discriminative thinking" ("vikalpa").
The process of meditation aims at "non-thinking," stopping both these cognitive processes.
Vitarka Mudrā.
The "Vitarka mudrā", "mudra of discussion," expresses "vitarka," joining the tips of the thumb and the index together, and keeping the other fingers straight.
This mudra has a great number of variants in Mahāyāna Buddhism, and is also known as "" and "Vyākhyāna mudrā" ("mudra of explanation").

Microcosmic orbit 
The microcosmic orbit (小周天), also known as the Self Winding Wheel of the Law, is a Taoist Qigong energy cultivation technique.
It involves deep breathing exercises in conjunction with meditation and concentration techniques which develop the flow of "qi" along certain pathways of energy in the human body which may be familiar to those who are studying traditional Chinese medicine, Qigong, T'ai chi ch'uan, Neidan and Chinese alchemy.
The exercise can be performed usually at first in a sitting position, but it can also be practiced standing as in Zhan zhuang or with movements included as with T'ai chi ch'uan.
The clear understanding of the microcosmic orbit technique is very important not only because of its historical context in the story of Chinese alchemy but because it is at the heart of many Taoist forms of exercise performed throughout the world by many millions of people today.
History.
The history of the microcosmic orbit dates back to prehistoric times in China, and the underlying principles can be found in the "I Ching" which according to legend was written by the Emperor Fu Xi approximately five thousand years ago or at least two centuries before the time of the Yellow Emperor.
For example, the Chinese character for the "I Ching" hexagram number 5, "Waiting", depicts a person sitting in meditation and the commentary pertains to the flow of energy from one of the psychic energy channels to another during meditation: 
Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu have also alluded to the technique of meditation and encouraging circulation of energy through the psychic meridians in their writings.
For example, Chuang Tzu's chapter entitled "Yang Sheng Chu" or "Principles of Health and Longevity" states: "Use your mind to carry the vital energy along your Tu Mo upward constantly" A stone carving in the White Cloud Temple in Beijing which bears an inscription "the sixth month of the year Ping-hsu of the Kuang-hsu era" (1886) contains a pictorial representation of some of the symbols which describe the processes involved in the microcosmic orbit meditation technique.
These particular techniques are derived from the Taoist Patriarch Lü Dongbin who was born in 798 AD.
Lü Dongbin was one of the Eight Immortals.
Practice.
The exercise itself usually begins with preparation designed to relax the physical body and develop the ability to concentrate.
Students may indeed be encouraged to practice Taoist Yoga exercises or T'ai chi ch'uan as a way of building enough energy to begin performing the microcosmic orbit exercise as it can induce a strain on the nervous system and cause energy depletion if practiced without adequate preparation.
To begin with the student is encouraged to develop deep abdominal breathing into the primary dantian or Taoist energy centre to develop heat and pressure in the lower abdomen or "Golden Stove".
A preparatory exercise known by some as the Lesser Heavenly circulation involves moving energy between two areas known as the seat of fire near the heart or the solar plexus where a psychic centre symbolised by the trigram "Li" from the I Ching is located, and the seat of water in the area of the kidneys where a psychic centre symbolised by the trigram "kan" is located.
Normally essence or "jing" can flow either way through the eight extra meridians or energy pathways in the body, but in the microcosmic orbit meditation exercise "jing" is encouraged to flow upwards along the Governor vessel during inhalation and then downwards along the conception vessel returning to the dantian on the exhalation.
This means that energy flows from the dantian downwards to the base of the spine then up the back along the centre line of the body to the crown of the head, then over the head and down the front centre line of the body and back to the starting point again making a full circle or orbit.
This prevents the body's natural essences from becoming depleted as they normally flow downwards from the brain or 'sea of marrow' and are lost during ejaculation or menstruation during the reproductive processes.
It is this "jing" or essence which is responsible for the reproductive processes in the body which allow the body to rejuvenate itself as well as for the reproductive processes which give rise to offspring.
Essence is also an important component in the manufacture of "qi" which can be translated into English as vitality or energy, the primary motive force which is life itself.
This raising and lowering Jing through the microcosmic orbit and returning it to the dantian purifies the essence and transforms it into"qi" or vitality.
As well as the lower dantian or cauldron there are other important points along the circuit of energy flow which include the 'three gates' which are areas where it is considered that energy may stagnate, these are the "wei-lu" or Tailbone gate, the Dorsal gate on the back roughly level with the heart, and the Jade pillow on the back of the head.
Other important areas include the "Ming Men" or gate of fire on the back about level with the kidneys and the "Baihui" or "Niwan" which is directly on top of the head.
The microcosmic orbit should be viewed in the context of a variety of Taoist exercises and techniques designed to purify the body physically, mentally and spiritually, improve health and longevity, and prepare the way for meditation, and also including other techniques such as the macrocosmic orbit which means circulating energy into the other psychic energy meridians which flow around the torso and out into the arms and legs.
These types of exercises are best practiced under the guidance of suitably qualified teachers who can help the beginner avoid any pitfalls and misunderstandings along the way rather than copied from books, especially if the subject may have a history of mental illness or emotional imbalance.
For example, according to Lu Kuan Yu: "It is harmful to pinpoint places in the body, the very idea of which should be relinquished since it hinders the course of the inner fire and of vitality."
Mantra 
A mantra (Pali: "manta") or mantram (Devanagari: मन्त्रम्) is a sacred utterance, a numinous sound, a syllable, word or phonemes, or group of words in Sanskrit, Pali and other languages believed by practitioners to have religious, magical or spiritual powers.
Some mantras have a syntactic structure and literal meaning, while others do not.
The earliest mantras were composed in Vedic Sanskrit in India.
At its simplest, the word ॐ (Aum, Om) serves as a mantra, it is believed to be the first sound which was originated on earth.
Aum sound when produced creates a reverberation in the body which helps the body and mind to be calm.
In more sophisticated forms, mantras are melodic phrases with spiritual interpretations such as a human longing for truth, reality, light, immortality, peace, love, knowledge, and action.
Some mantras without literal meaning are musically uplifting and spiritually meaningful.
The use, structure, function, importance, and types of mantras vary according to the school and philosophy of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism.
In Japanese Shingon tradition, the word "Shingon" means mantra.
Mantras serve a central role in tantra.
In this school, mantras are considered to be a sacred formula and a deeply personal ritual, effective only after initiation.
In other schools of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism or Sikhism, initiation is not a requirement.
The word "mantra" is also used in English to refer to something that is said frequently and is deliberately repeated over and over and thus possibly becomes boring by dint of too much repetition.
Etymology and origins.
The Sanskrit word "" is derived from the root "man-" "to think".
Scholars consider the use of mantras to have begun before 1000 BC.
By the middle Vedic period (1000 BC to 500 BC) – claims Frits Staal – mantras in Hinduism had developed into a blend of art and science.
The Chinese translation is , the Japanese on'yomi reading of the Chinese being "shingon" (which is also used as the proper name for the Shingon sect).
According to Alex Wayman and Ryujun Tajima, "Zhenyan" (or "Shingon") means "true speech", has the sense of "an exact mantra which reveals the truth of the dharmas", and is the path of mantras.
According to Bernfried Schlerath, the concept of "sātyas mantras" is found in Indo-Iranian Yasna 31.6 and the Rigveda, where it is considered structured thought in conformity with the reality or poetic (religious) formulas associated with inherent fulfillment.
Definition.
There is no generally accepted definition of mantra.
Renou has defined mantra as a thought.
Mantras are structured formulae of thoughts, claims Silburn.
Farquhar concludes that mantras are a religious thought, prayer, sacred utterance, but also believed to be a spell or weapon of supernatural power.
Zimmer defines mantra as a verbal instrument to produce something in one's mind.
Bharati defines mantra, in the context of the Tantric school of Hinduism, to be a combination of mixed genuine and quasi-morphemes arranged in conventional patterns, based on codified esoteric traditions, passed on from a guru to a disciple through prescribed initiation.
Jan Gonda, a widely cited scholar on Indian mantras, defines mantra as general name for the verses, formulas or sequence of words in prose which contain praise, are believed to have religious, magical or spiritual efficiency, which are meditated upon, recited, muttered or sung in a ritual, and which are collected in the methodically arranged ancient texts of Hinduism.
There is no universally applicable uniform definition of mantra because mantras are used in different religions, and within each religion in different schools of philosophy.
In some schools of Hinduism for example, suggests Gonda, a mantra is sakti (power) to the devotee in the form of formulated and expressed thought.
Staal clarifies that mantras are not rituals, they are what is recited or chanted during a ritual.
In Oxford Living Dictionary mantra is defined as a word or sound repeated to aid concentration in meditation.
Cambridge Dictionary provides two different definitions.
The first refers to Hinduism and Buddhism: a word or sound that is believed to have a special spiritual power.
The second definition is more general: a word or phrase that is often repeated and expresses a particularly strong belief.
For instance, a football team can choose individual words as their own "mantra."
There is a long history of scholarly disagreement on the meaning of mantras and whether they are instruments of mind, as implied by the etymological origin of the word "mantra".
One school suggests mantras are mostly meaningless sound constructs, while the other holds them to be mostly meaningful linguistic instruments of mind.
Both schools agree that mantras have melody and a well designed mathematical precision in their construction and that their influence on the reciter and listener is similar to that is observed in people around the world listening to their beloved music that is devoid of words.
Staal presents a non-linguistic view of mantras.
He suggests that verse mantras are metered and harmonized to mathematical precision (for example, in the "viharanam" technique), which resonate, but a lot of them are a hodgepodge of meaningless constructs such as are found in folk music around the world.
Staal cautions that there are many mantras that can be translated and do have spiritual meaning and philosophical themes central to Hinduism, but that does not mean all mantras have a literal meaning.
He further notes that even when mantras do not have a literal meaning, they do set a tone and ambiance in the ritual as they are recited, and thus have a straightforward and uncontroversial ritualistic meaning.
The sounds may lack literal meaning, but they can have an effect.
He compares mantras to bird songs, that have the power to communicate, yet do not have a literal meaning.
On that "saman" category of Hindu mantras, which Staal described as resembling the arias of Bach's oratorios and other European classics, he notes that these mantras have musical structure, but they almost always are completely different from anything in the syntax of natural languages.
Mantras are literally meaningless, yet musically meaningful to Staal.
The "saman" chant mantras were transmitted from one Hindu generation to next verbally for over 1000 years but never written, a feat, suggests Staal, that was made possible by the strict mathematical principles used in constructing the mantras.
These "saman" chant mantras are also mostly meaningless, cannot be literally translated as Sanskrit or any Indian language, but nevertheless are beautiful in their resonant themes, variations, inversions, and distribution.
They draw the devotee in. Staal is not the first person to view Hindu mantras in this manner.
The ancient Hindu Vedic ritualist Kautsa was one of the earliest scholars to note that mantras are meaningless; their function is phonetic and syntactic, not semantic.
Harvey Alper and others present mantras from the linguistic point view.
They admit Staal's observation that many mantras do contain bits and pieces of meaningless jargon, but they question what language or text doesn't.
The presence of an abracadabra bit does not necessarily imply the entire work is meaningless.
Alper lists numerous mantras that have philosophical themes, moral principles, a call to virtuous life, and even mundane petitions.
He suggests that from a set of millions of mantras, the devotee chooses some mantras voluntarily, thus expressing that speaker's intention, and the audience for that mantra is that speaker's chosen spiritual entity.
Mantras deploy the language of spiritual expression, they are religious instruments, and that is what matters to the devotee.
A mantra creates a feeling in the practicing person.
It has an emotive numinous effect, it mesmerizes, it defies expression, and it creates sensations that are by definition private and at the heart of all religions and spiritual phenomena.
Hinduism.
History.
According to Indologist Frits Staal, during the early Vedic period, Vedic poets became fascinated by the inspirational power of poems, metered verses, and music.
They referred to them with the root "dhi-", which evolved into the "dhyana" (meditation) of Hinduism, and the language used to start and assist this process manifested as a mantra.
By the middle vedic period (1000 BC to 500 BC), mantras were derived from all vedic compositions.
They included "ṛc" (verses from Rigveda for example), "sāman" (musical chants from the Sāmaveda for example), "yajus" (a muttered formula from the yajurveda for example), and "nigada" (a loudly spoken yajus).
During the Hindu Epics period and after, mantras multiplied in many ways and diversified to meet the needs and passions of various schools of Hinduism.
In the "Linga Purana," Mantra is listed as one of the 1,008 names of Lord Shiva.
Numerous ancient mantras are found in the Saṃhitā portion of the Vedas.
The Saṃhitās are the most ancient layer of the Vedas, and contain numerous mantras, hymns, prayers, and litanies.
The Rigveda Samhita contains about 10552 Mantras, classified into ten books called Mandalas.
A Sukta is a group of Mantras.
Mantras come in many forms, including "ṛc" (verses from the Rigveda for example) and "sāman" (musical chants from the Sāmaveda for example).
According to Hindu tradition, the Vedas are sacred scriptures which were revealed (and not composed) by the seers (Rishis).
According to the ancient commentator and linguist, Yaska, these ancient sacred revelations were then passed down through an oral tradition and are considered to be the foundation for the Hindu tradition.
Mantras took a center stage in Tantric traditions, which made extensive ritual and meditative use of mantras, and posited that each mantra is a deity in sonic form.
Function and structure.
One function of mantras is to solemnize and ratify rituals.
Each mantra, in Vedic rituals, is coupled with an act.
According to "Apastamba Srauta Sutra", each ritual act is accompanied by one mantra, unless the "Sutra" explicitly marks that one act corresponds to several mantras.
According to Gonda, and others, there is a connection and rationale between a Vedic mantra and each Vedic ritual act that accompanies it.
In these cases, the function of mantras was to be an instrument of ritual efficacy for the priest, and a tool of instruction for a ritual act for others.
Over time, as the Puranas and Epics were composed, the concepts of worship, virtues and spirituality evolved in Hinduism and new schools of Hinduism were founded, each continuing to develop and refine its own mantras.
In Hinduism, suggests Alper, the function of mantras shifted from the quotidian to redemptive.
In other words, in Vedic times, mantras were recited a practical, quotidian goal as intention, such as requesting a deity's help in the discovery of lost cattle, cure of illness, succeeding in competitive sport or journey away from home.
The literal translation of Vedic mantras suggests that the function of mantra, in these cases, was to cope with the uncertainties and dilemmas of daily life.
In a later period of Hinduism, mantras were recited with a transcendental redemptive goal as intention, such as escape from the cycle of life and rebirth, forgiveness for bad karma, and experiencing a spiritual connection with the god.
The function of mantras, in these cases, was to cope with the human condition as a whole.
According to Alper, redemptive spiritual mantras opened the door for mantras where every part need not have a literal meaning, but together their resonance and musical quality assisted the transcendental spiritual process.
Overall, explains Alper, using Śivasūtra mantras as an example, Hindu mantras have philosophical themes and are metaphorical with social dimension and meaning; in other words, they are a spiritual language and instrument of thought.
According to Staal, Hindu mantras may be spoken aloud, "anirukta" (not enunciated), "upamsu" (inaudible), or "manasa" (not spoken, but recited in the mind).
In ritual use, mantras are often silent instruments of meditation.
Invocation.
For almost every mantra, there are six limbs called "Shadanga".
These six limbs are: Seer (Rishi), "Deity" (Devata), "Seed" (Beeja), "Energy" (Shakti), "Poetic Meter" (chanda), and "Kilaka" (Lock).
Methods.
The most basic mantra is "Om", which in Hinduism is known as the "pranava mantra," the source of all mantras.
The Hindu philosophy behind this is the premise that before existence and beyond existence is only One reality, Brahman, and the first manifestation of Brahman expressed as Om.
For this reason, Om is considered as a foundational idea and reminder, and thus is prefixed and suffixed to all Hindu prayers.
While some mantras may invoke individual gods or principles, fundamental mantras, like the 'Shanti Mantra, the 'Gayatri Mantra' and others all ultimately focus on the One reality.
Tantric 
In the Tantric school the universe is sound.
The supreme (para) brings forth existence through the Word (Shabda).
Creation consists of vibrations at various frequencies and amplitudes giving rise to the phenomena of the world.
Buhnemann notes that deity mantras are an essential part of Tantric compendia.
The tantric mantras vary in their structure and length.
Mala mantras are those mantras which have an enormous number of syllables.
In contrast, bija mantras are one-syllabled, typically ending in anusvara (a simple nasal sound).
These are derived from the name of a deity; for example, Durga yields "dum" and Ganesha yields "gam".
Bija mantras are prefixed and appended to other mantras, thereby creating complex mantras.
In the tantric school, these mantras are believed to have supernatural powers, and they are transmitted by a preceptor to a disciple in an initiation ritual.
Tantric mantras found a significant audience and adaptations in medieval India, Southeast Asia and numerous other Asian countries with Buddhism.
Majumdar and other scholars suggest mantras are central to the Tantric school, with numerous functions.
From initiating and emancipating a tantric devotee to worshiping manifested forms of the divine.
From enabling heightened sexual energy in the male and the female to acquiring supernormal psychological and spiritual power.
From preventing evil influences to exorcizing demons, and many others.
These claimed functions and other aspects of the tantric mantra are a subject of controversy among scholars.
Tantra usage is not unique to Hinduism: it is also found in Buddhism both inside and outside India.
Japa 
Mantra "japa" is a practice of repetitively uttering the same mantra for an auspicious number of times, the most popular being 108, and sometimes just 5, 10, 28 or 1008.
"Japa" is found in personal prayer or meditative efforts of some Hindus, as well during formal puja (group prayers).
Japa is assisted by malas (bead necklaces) containing 108 beads and a head bead (sometimes referred to as the 'meru', or 'guru' bead); the devotee using his/her fingers to count each bead as he/she repeats the chosen mantra.
Having reached 108 repetitions, if he/she wishes to continue another cycle of mantras, the devotee turns the mala around without crossing the head bead and repeats the cycle.
Japa-yajna is claimed to be most effective if the mantra is repeated silently in mind (manasah).
According to this school, any shloka from holy Hindu texts like the Vedas, Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, Yoga Sutra, even the Mahabharata, Ramayana, Durga saptashati or Chandi is a mantra, thus can be part of the "japa", repeated to achieve a numinous effect.
The "Dharmasāstra" claims Gāyatri mantra derived from Rig Veda verse 3.62.10, and the Purușasūkta mantra from Rig Veda verse 10.90 are most auspicious mantras for "japa" at sunrise and sunset; it is claimed to purify the mind and spirit.
Examples.
Other important Hindu mantras include: 
In the "Shiva Sutras" 
Apart from Shiva Sutras, which originated from Shiva's tandava dance, the Shiva Sutras of Vasugupta are a collection of seventy-seven aphorisms that form the foundation of the tradition of spiritual mysticism known as Kashmir Shaivism.
They are attributed to the sage Vasugupta of the 9th century C.E. "Sambhavopaya" (1-1 to 1–22), "Saktopaya" (2-1 to 2–10) and "Anavopaya" (3-1 to 3–45) are the main sub-divisions, three means of achieving God consciousness, of which the main technique of "Saktopaya" is a mantra.
But "mantra" in this context does not mean incantation or muttering of some sacred formula.
The word "mantra" is used here in its etymological signification.
That which saves one by pondering over the light of Supreme I-consciousness is a mantra.
The divine Supreme I-consciousness is the dynamo of all the mantras.
"Deha" or body has been compared to wood, "mantra" has been compared to "arani"—a piece of wood used for kindling fire by friction; "prana" has been compared to fire.
"Sikha" or flame has been compared to "atma" (Self); "ambara" or sky has been compared to Shiva.
When prana is kindled by means of mantra used as arani, fire in the form of "udana" arises in "susumna", and then just as flame arises out of kindled fire and gets dissolved in the sky, so also "atma" (Self) like a flame having burnt down the fuel of the body, gets absorbed in Shiva.
Buddhism.
One of the most ancient Buddhist mantras is the famous "Pratītyasamutpāda-gāthā", also known as the dependent origination dhāraṇī.
This phrase is said to encapsulate the meaning of the Buddha's Teaching.
It was a popular Buddhist verse and was used as a mantra.
This mantra is found inscribed on numerous ancient Buddhist statues, chaityas, and images.
The Sanskrit version of this mantra is:ye dharmā hetuprabhavā hetuṃ teṣāṃ tathāgato hyavadat, teṣāṃ ca yo nirodha evaṃvādī mahāśramaṇaḥThe phrase can be translated as follows:Of those phenomena which arise from causes: Those causes have been taught by the Tathāgata (Buddha), and their cessation too - thus proclaims the Great Ascetic.
Theravada.
According to the American Buddhist teacher Jack Kornfield: 
Mantra practice is often combined with breathing meditation, so that one recites a mantra simultaneously with in-breath and out-breath to help develop tranquility and concentration.
Mantra meditation is especially popular among lay people.
Like other basic concentration exercises, it can be used simply to the mind, or it can be the basis for an insight practice where the mantra becomes the focus of observation of how life unfolds, or an aid in surrendering and letting go."
The "Buddho" mantra is widespread in the Thai Forest Tradition and was taught by Ajahn Chah and his students.
Another popular mantra in Thai Buddhism is "Samma-Araham", referring to the Buddha who has 'perfectly' ("samma") attained 'perfection in the Buddhist sense' ("araham"), used in Dhammakaya meditation.
In the Tantric Theravada tradition of Southeast Asia, mantras are central to their method of meditation.
Popular mantras in this tradition include "Namo Buddhaya" ("Homage to the Buddha") and "Araham" ("Worthy One").
There are Thai Buddhist amulet katha: that is, mantras to be recited while holding an amulet.
Mahayana Buddhism.
The use of mantras became very popular with the rise of Mahayana Buddhism.
Many Mahayana sutras contain mantras, bijamantras, dharanis and other similar phrases which were chanted or used in meditation.
One popular bija (seed) mantra in Mahayana Buddhism is the Sanskrit letter A (see A in Buddhism).
This seed mantra was equated with Prajñaparamita, emptiness and non-arising (anutpada).
This seed mantra remains in use in Shingon, Dzogchen and Rinzai Zen.
Mahayana Buddhism also adopted the Om mantra, which is found incorporated into various Mahayana Buddhist mantras (like Om Mani Padme Hum).
Another early and influential Mahayana "mantra" or dharani is the Arapacana alphabet (of non-sanskrit origin, possibly Karosthi) which is used as a contemplative tool in the Long Prajñāpāramitā sutras.
The entire alphabet runs: a ra pa ca na la da ba ḍa ṣa va ta ya ṣṭa ka sa ma ga stha ja śva dha śa kha kṣa sta jña rta ha bha cha sma hva tsa bha ṭha ṇa pha ska ysa śca ṭa ḍhaIn this practice, each letter stood for a specific idea (for example, "a" stands for non-arising (anutpada), and pa stands for paramārtha.
As such, this practice was also a kind of mnemonic technique ("dhāraṇīmukha") which allowed one to remember the key points of the teaching.
The Mahayana sutras introduced various mantras into Mahayana Buddhism, such as: 
East Asian Buddhism.
China.
In Chinese Buddhism, various mantras, including the Great Compassion Mantra, the Uṣṇīṣa Vijaya Dhāraṇī from the Uṣṇīṣa Vijaya Dhāraṇī Sutra, the Mahāmāyūrī Vidyārājñī Dhāraṇī, the Heart Sutra and various forms of nianfo are commonly chanted by both monastics and laymen.
A major mantra in the Chan Buddhist tradition is the Śūraṅgama Mantra from the Śūraṅgama Sutra, which extensively references Buddhist deities such as the bodhisattvas Manjushri, Mahākāla, Sitatapatra, Vajrapani and the Five Tathagatas, especially Bhaisajyaguru.
It is often used for protection or purification, as it is often recited as part of the daily morning session in monasteries.
In addition, various Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and deities also have mantras associated with them.
In China and Vietnam, a set of mantras known as the Ten Small Mantras (Chinese: 十小咒; Pinyin: "Shíxiǎozhòu") were fixed by the monk Yulin (Chinese: 玉琳國師; Pinyin: "Yùlín Guóshī"), a teacher of the Shunzhi Emperor, for monks, nuns, and laity to chant during morning liturgical services.
They are still chanted in modern Chinese Buddhism.
Chinese Chan Buddhism also makes use of esoteric mantras, a practice which can be traced back to the Tang dynasty.
One of these is the Śūraṅgama Mantra, which has been taught by various modern Chan monks, such as Venerable Hsuan Hua.
Shaolin temple monks also made use of esoteric mantras and dharani.
Japanese Shingon.
Kūkai (774–835), a noted Buddhist monk, advanced a general theory of language based on his analysis of two forms of Buddhist ritual language: "dharani" (dhāra.nī) and "mantra".
Mantra is restricted to esoteric Buddhist practice whereas dharani is found in both esoteric and exoteric ritual.
Dharanis for instance are found in the Heart Sutra.
The term "shingon" is the Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese transcription of the Sanskrit word "mantra", 真言 ("zhēnyán").
Kūkai classified mantra as a special class of dharani and suggested that every syllable of a dharani was a manifestation of the true nature of reality – in Buddhist terms that all sound is a manifestation of shunyata or emptiness of self-nature.
Thus rather than being devoid of meaning, Kūkai suggests that dharanis are in fact saturated with meaning – every syllable is symbolic on multiple levels.
One of Kūkai's distinctive contributions was to take this symbolic association even further by saying that there is no essential difference between the syllables of mantras and sacred texts, and those of ordinary language.
If one understood the workings of mantra, then any sounds could be a representative of ultimate reality.
This emphasis on sounds was one of the drivers for Kūkai's championing of the phonetic writing system, the kana, which was adopted in Japan around the time of Kūkai.
He is generally credited with the invention of the kana, but there is apparently some doubt about this story amongst scholars.
This mantra-based theory of language had a powerful effect on Japanese thought and society which up until Kūkai's time had been dominated by imported Chinese culture of thought, particularly in the form of the Classical Chinese language which was used in the court and amongst the literati, and Confucianism which was the dominant political ideology.
In particular, Kūkai was able to use this new theory of language to create links between indigenous Japanese culture and Buddhism.
For instance, he made a link between the Buddha Mahavairocana and the Shinto sun Goddess Amaterasu.
Since the emperors were thought to be descended form Amaterasu, Kūkai had found a powerful connection here that linked the emperors with the Buddha, and also in finding a way to integrate Shinto with Buddhism, something that had not happened with Confucianism.
Buddhism then became essentially an indigenous religion in a way that Confucianism had not.
And it was through language and mantra that this connection was made.
Kūkai helped to elucidate what mantra is in a way that had not been done before: he addresses the fundamental questions of what a text is, how signs function, and above all, what language is.
In this, he covers some of the same ground as modern day Structuralists and others scholars of language, although he comes to very different conclusions.
In this system of thought, all sounds are said to originate from "a".
For esoteric Buddhism "a" has a special function because it is associated with Shunyata or the idea that no thing exists in its own right, but is contingent upon causes and conditions.
(See Dependent origination) In Sanskrit "a" is a prefix which changes the meaning of a word into its opposite, so "vidya" is understanding, and "avidya" is ignorance (the same arrangement is also found in many Greek words, like e.g. "atheism" vs. "theism" and "apathy" vs. "pathos").
The letter a is both visualised in the Siddham script and pronounced in rituals and meditation practices.
In the Mahavairocana Sutra which is central to Shingon Buddhism it says: "Thanks to the original vows of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, a miraculous force resides in the mantras, so that by pronouncing them one acquires merit without limits". [in Conze, p. 183] 
A mantra is Kuji-kiri in Shingon as well as in Shugendo.
The practice of writing mantras, and copying texts as a spiritual practice, became very refined in Japan, and some of these are written in the Japanese script and Siddham script of Sanskrit, recited in either language.
Main Shingon Mantras.
There are thirteen mantras used in Shingon Buddhism, each dedicated to a major deity (the "thirteen Buddhas" - "jūsanbutsu -" of Shingon).
The mantras are drawn from the "Vairocanābhisaṃbodhi Sūtra".
The mantra for each deity name in Japanese, its equivalent name in Sanskrit, the Sanskrit mantra, and the Japanese version in the Shingon tradition are as follows: 
Other Japanese Buddhist traditions.
Mantras are also an important element of other Japanese Buddhist traditions.
The Tendai school includes extensive repertoire of Esoteric Buddhist practices, which include the use of mantras.
Nichiren Buddhist practice focuses on the chanting of one single mantra or phrase: "Nam Myōhō Renge Kyō" (南無妙法蓮華経, which means "Homage to the Lotus Sutra").
Japanese Zen also makes use of mantras.
One example is the Mantra of Light ("kōmyō shingon"), which is common in Japanese Soto Zen and was derived from the Shingon sect.
The use of esoteric practices (such as mantra) within Zen is sometimes termed "mixed Zen" ("kenshū zen" 兼修禪).
Keizan Jōkin (1264–1325) is seen as a key figure that introduced this practice into the Soto school.
A common mantra used in Soto Zen is the Śūraṅgama mantra ("Ryōgon shu" 楞嚴呪; T. 944A).
In Northern Vajrayana Buddhism.
Mantrayana (Sanskrit), which may be translated as "way of the mantra", was the original self-identifying name of those that have come to be determined 'Nyingmapa'.
The Nyingmapa which may be rendered as "those of the ancient way", a name constructed due to the genesis of the Sarma "fresh", "new" traditions.
Mantrayana has developed into a synonym of Vajrayana.
Noted translator of Buddhist texts Edward Conze (1904–1979) distinguishes three periods in the Buddhist use of mantra.
Initially, according to Conze, like their fellow Indians, Buddhists used mantra as protective spells to ward off malign influences.
Despite a Vinaya rule which forbids monks engaging in the Brahminical practice of chanting mantras for material gain, there is a number of protective mantras for a group of ascetic monks.
However, even at this early stage, there is perhaps something more than animistic magic at work.
Particularly in the case of the Ratana Sutta the efficacy of the verses seems to be related to the concept of "truth".
Each verse of the sutta ends with "by the virtue of this truth may there be happiness".
Conze notes that later mantras were used more to guard the spiritual life of the chanter, and sections on mantras began to be included in some Mahayana sutras such as the White Lotus Sutra, and the Lankavatara Sutra.
The scope of protection also changed in this time.
In the Sutra of Golden Light the Four Great Kings promise to exercise sovereignty over the different classes of demigods, to protect the whole of Jambudvipa (the Indian subcontinent), to protect monks who proclaim the sutra, and to protect kings who patronise the monks who proclaim the sutra.
The apotheosis of this type of approach is the Nichiren school of Buddhism that was founded in the 13th century Japan, and which distilled many previously complex Buddhist practices down to the veneration of the Lotus Sutra through a recitation of the daimoku: "Nam myoho renge kyo" which translates as "Homage to the Lotus Sutra".
The third period began, according to Conze, in about the 7th century, to take center stage and become a vehicle for salvation in their own right.
Tantra started to gain momentum in the 6th and 7th century, with specifically Buddhist forms appearing as early as 300CE.
"Mantrayana" was an early name for what is now more commonly known as "Vajrayana", which gives us a hint as to the place of mantra in Indo-Tibetan Buddhism.
The aim of Vajrayana practice is to give the practitioner a direct experience of reality, of things as they really are.
Mantras function as symbols of that reality, and different mantras are different aspects of that reality – for example wisdom or compassion.
Mantras are often associated with a particular deity, one famous exception being the Prajnaparamita mantra associated with the Heart Sutra.
One of the key Vajrayana strategies for bringing about a direct experience of reality is to engage the entire psycho-physical organism in the practices.
In one Buddhist analysis, the person consists of 'body, speech and mind' (refer: Three Vajra).
So a typical sadhana or meditation practice might include mudras, or symbolic hand gestures; the recitations of mantras; as well as the visualisation of celestial beings and visualising the letters of the mantra which is being recited.
Clearly here mantra is associated with speech.
The meditator may visualise the letters in front of themselves, or within their body.
They may be pronounced out loud, or internally in mind only.
Om mani padme hum.
Probably the most famous mantra of Buddhism is Om mani padme hum, the six syllable mantra of the Bodhisattva of compassion Avalokiteśvara (Tibetan: "Chenrezig", Chinese: "Guanyin").
This mantra is particularly associated with the four-armed Shadakshari form of Avalokiteśvara.
The Dalai Lama is said to be an incarnation of Avalokiteshvara, and so the mantra is especially revered by his devotees.
The book "Foundations of Tibetan Mysticism" by Lama Anagarika Govinda, gives a classic example of how such a mantra can contain many levels of symbolic meaning.
Other.
The following list of mantras is from "", Volume 1, Number 2, 1973. (pp. 168–169) (augmented by other contributors).
The mantras used in Tibetan Buddhist practice are in Sanskrit, to preserve the original mantras.
Visualizations and other practices are usually done in the Tibetan language.
According to Tibetan Buddhism, this mantra (Om tare tutare ture soha) can not only eliminate disease, troubles, disasters, and karma, but will also bring believers blessings, longer life, and even the wisdom to transcend one's circle of reincarnation.
Tara representing long life and health.
In Bon.
There are also numerous mantras in the Bön religion such as "Om Ma Tri Mu Ye Sa Le Du".
Zoroastrianism.
In Zoroastrianism, the use of mantras () goes back to Zarathustra himself, who describes his role as a prophet of Ahura Mazda explicitly as a knower of mantras (; ).
In the Zoroastrian tradition, a mantra is usually a shorter inspired utterance that accompanies religious rituals.
They differ from the longer, often eight-syllable praise songs (called Yasht in the Avesta) as well as the often eleven-syllable songs (called Gathas in the Avesta as well as in the Vedas).
The four most important Zoroastrian mantras are the Ahuna Vairya, the Ashem Vohu, the Yenghe hatam, and the Airyaman ishya.
Both Vedic and Avestan mantras have a number of functional similarities.
One of these is the idea that truth, when properly expressed in the mantra, can compel a deity to grant the speaker's request(compare Sacca-kiriya).
Another similarity is the Vedic and Avestic association of mantras with paths, so that a properly formulated mantra can open a path to the deity addressed.
Because of the etymological and conceptual similarity, such religious utterances must therefore have already been known during the common Indo-Iranian period, when the people of the Avesta and of the Vedas formed a single people.
They are, therefore, not derived from the Vedic tradition, but represent an independent development of ancient Iran, corresponding to that in ancient India.
The study of their commonalities is therefore important for understanding the poetic and religious traditions of the early Indo-Iranians.
Jainism.
The concept of mantras in Jainism mainly deals with seeking forgiveness, praising Arihants, or Pañca-Parameṣṭhi Yet some mantras are claimed to enhance intellect, prosperity, wealth or fame.
There are many mantras in Jainism; most of them are in Sanskrit or Prakrit, but in the last few centuries, some have been composed in Hindi or Gujrati languages.
Mantras, couplets, are either chanted or sung, either aloud or by merely moving lips or in silence by thought.
Namokar.
Some examples of Jain mantras are Bhaktamara Stotra, Uvasagharam Stotra and [[Rishi Mandal Mantra.
The greatest is the Namokar or [[Navkar Mantra]].
Acharya Sushil Kumar, a self-realized master of the secrets of the Mantra, wrote in 1987: "There is a deep, secret science to the combination of sounds.
Specific syllables are seeds for the awakening of latent powers.
Only a person who has been initiated into the vibrational realms, who has actually experienced this level of reality, can fully understand the Science of Letters...the Nomokar Mantra is a treasured gift to humanity of unestimable (sic) worth for the purification, upliftment and spiritual evolution of everyone.".
His book, The Song of the Soul, is a practical manual to unlock the secrets of the mantra.
"Chanting with Guruji" is a compilation of well-known Jain mantras, including the Rishi Mandal Mantra.
The Navkar Mantra (literally, "Nine Line Mantra") is the central mantra of [[Jainism]].
"It is the essence of the gospel of the Tirthankars."
The initial 5 lines consist of salutations to various purified souls, and the latter 4 lines are explanatory in nature, highlighting the benefits and greatness of this mantra.
Universal compassion.
"[[Pratikraman]]" also contains the following prayer: 
Forgiveness.
[[Forgiveness]] is one of the main virtues Jains cultivate.
"Kṣamāpanā", or supreme forgiveness, forms part of one of the ten characteristics of "[[Dharma (Jainism)|dharma]]". &lt;br&gt;In the "[[pratikramana]]" prayer, Jains repeatedly seek forgiveness from various creatures—even from "ekindriyas" or single sensed beings like plants and microorganisms that they may have harmed while eating and doing routine activities.
Forgiveness is asked by uttering the phrase, "Micchāmi dukkaḍaṃ."
"Micchāmi dukkaḍaṃ" is a Prakrit phrase literally meaning "may all the evil that has been done be fruitless."
In their daily prayers and [[samayika]], Jains recite the following "Iryavahi sutra" in Prakrit, seeking forgiveness from literally all creatures while involved in routine activities: 
May you, O Revered One, voluntarily permit me.
I would like to confess my sinful acts committed while walking.
I honour your permission.
I desire to absolve myself of the sinful acts by confessing them.
I seek forgiveness from all those living beings which I may have tortured while walking, coming and going, treading on a living organism, seeds, green grass, dew drops, ant hills, moss, live water, live earth, spider web and others.
I seek forgiveness from all these living beings, be they one sensed, two sensed, three sensed, four sensed or five sensed, which I may have kicked, covered with dust, rubbed with earth, collided with other, turned upside down, tormented, frightened, shifted from one place to another or killed and deprived them of their lives.
(By confessing) may I be absolved of all these sins.
Sikhism.
In the [[Sikh]] religion, a "mantar" or "mantra" is a [[Shabad (hymn)|Shabad]] (Word or [[hymn]]) from the [[Adi Granth]] to concentrate the mind on God.
Through repetition of the mantra, and listening to one's own voice, thoughts are reduced and the mind rises above materialism to tune into the voice of God.
Mantras in Sikhism are fundamentally different from the secret mantras used in other religions.
Unlike in other religions, Sikh mantras are open for anyone to use.
They are used openly and are not taught in secret sessions but are used in front of assemblies of Sikhs.
The [[Mool Mantar]], the first composition of [[Guru Nanak]], is the second most widely known Sikh mantra.
The most widely known mantra in the Sikh faith is "Wahe Guru."
According to the Sikh poet Bhai Gurdas, the word "Wahe Guru" is the Gurmantra, or the mantra given by the Guru, and eliminates ego.
According to the 10th Sikh Master, Guru Gobind Singh, the "Wahe Guru" mantra was given by God to the Order of the Khalsa, and reforms the apostate into the purified.
Chinese religions.
The influence of [[Chinese Esoteric Buddhism]] during the [[Six Dynasties]] period and the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] led to the widespread use of Buddhist esoteric practices in other Chinese religions such as [[Taoism]].
This included the use of mantras.
Mantras are often still used in Chinese [[Taoism]], such as the words in "Dàfàn yǐnyǔ wúliàng yīn" (大梵隱語無量音), the recitation of a deity's name.
Another example of a Taoist mantra is found in one of the most popular liturgies in Taoism (dating from the Tang dynasty), the "Pei-tou yen-sheng ching" ("The North Star Scripture of Longevity"), which contains a long mantra called the "North Star Mantra."
The text claims that this mantra "can deliver you from disaster," "ward off evil and give you prosperity and longevity," "help you accumulate good deeds" and give you peace of mind.
The Indian syllable "[[om]]" (唵) is also used in Taoist esotericism.
After the arrival of Buddhism many Taoist sects started to use Sanskrit syllables in their mantras or talisman as a way to enhance one's spiritual power aside from the traditional [[Han Chinese|Han]] incantations.
One example of this is the "heart mantra" of Pu Hua Tian Zun (普化天尊), a Taoist deity manifested from the first thunder and head of the “36 thunder gods” in orthodox religious Taoism.
His mantra is "Ǎn hōng zhā lì sà mó luō - 唵吽吒唎薩嚩囉".
Taoist believe this incantation to be the heart mantra of Pu Hua Tian Zun which will protect them from bad [[qi]] and calm down emotions.
Taoist mantra recitation may also be practiced along with extensive visualization exercises.
There are also mantras in [[Cheondoism]], [[Daesun Jinrihoe]], [[Jeung San Do]] and [[Onmyōdō]].
Other Chinese religions have also adopted the use of mantras.

Acem Meditation 
Acem Meditation is a meditation technique developed in Norway since 1966 by the Acem School of Meditation and is now taught in many countries.
It is non-religious, and its effects are attributed to psychological and physiological mechanisms.
It is process-oriented, correct meditation being defined in terms of practice rather than experiences or states of mind.
In contrast to many other forms of meditation, it makes no use of concentration, but instead allows spontaneous thoughts to come and go during the practice.
According to Acem, this increases relaxation effects and stimulates long-term processes of personal growth.
Technique.
Acem Meditation involves the mental repetition of a simple sound, called a "meditation sound", a meaningless combination of vowels and consonants which is believed to help mind and body relax and to bring unconscious material closer to consciousness.
The way the meditator repeats the meditation sound is considered to be of paramount importance: the sound should be repeated with a so-called 'free mental attitude', i.e., in an effortless manner which does not require concentration and which allows thoughts, feelings and other impulses to come and go freely; forgetting the sound from time to time because one is absorbed by spontaneous thoughts is considered a central part of the technique.
In keeping with this emphasis on a free mental attitude, Acem does not recommend any meditation position that strains the body.
The meditator should sit comfortably with good support for the lower back.
Meditation habits vary, but for long-term results 30 minutes twice a day or 45 minutes once a day is recommended.
Acem Meditation offers beginner's courses, courses for established meditators, and retreats with long meditations.
These courses emphasise group dynamics and encourage discussion of one's practice.
Individual or group guidance is seen as a help to increase the effect of meditation, and sometimes provides opportunities for discussion of central life issues, which are believed to be reflected in one's meditative practice.
Long meditations (i.e. meditations of more than an hour) followed by guidance are believed to provide deeper relaxation and increase the potential for personal growth.
Most Acem centres arrange meetings with meditations of 1½ to 2 hours.
At retreats, the length of time is increased beyond the 3-hour level, and at so-called deepening retreats beyond the 6-hour level.
Research.
In recent years, an increasing amount of research has been carried out on the psychological and physiological effects of meditation techniques in general and of Acem Meditation in particular.
In his 2004 doctoral thesis from the Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Norway, Dr. Erik Ekker Solberg explored the psychobiological effects of Acem Meditation.
One of his studies shows that Acem Meditation reduces heart rate, blood pressure, and muscular tension.
The heart rate reduction is stronger and more stable than at ordinary rest.
A slow heart rate is usually considered to indicate relaxation.
Dr. Solberg's research also suggests that advanced meditators have higher melatonin levels than non-meditators (though melatonin decreases during long meditation), possibly an effect of long-term relaxation.
In a study of performance under stress, marksmen who had learned Acem Meditation improved their results in competition marksmanship, compared to a control group that did not learn meditation, indicating that Acem Meditation reduces the level of stress in tense and demanding situations.
Another study showed that the meditators had significantly lower blood lactate concentration after physical exercise than the control group, indicating faster recovery.
In a study on the effect of meditation on immune cells, Erik Solberg found that long term practice of meditation may influence absolute lymphocyte counts at rest.
Runners practising meditation had lower lymphocyte counts at rest before the race.
Effects.
Relaxation is presented as a basic effect of Acem Meditation.
The beneficial effects of the technique on insomnia, concentration problems, headaches and other bodily symptoms, social relations etc. are seen as extensions of the relaxation response elicited by the practice.
Acem Meditation is often used as a tool in stress management, and Acem also arranges courses specifically designed to deal with stress.
For regular practitioners, however, Acem Meditation is typically seen as a method for long-term personal growth rather than just a relaxation technique.
According to Acem's psychology of meditation, meditation may help the individual to overcome some of the limitations set by his or her personality, leading to a freer frame of mind and a higher degree of receptivity and sensitivity.
The same limitations that create problems for the person in his everyday life will also at times influence his meditation practice.
For instance, a tense person may repeat the meditation sound too forcefully, while an evasive person may tend to be more passive in his meditation.
Adjusting one's meditative practice is seen as a means to overcome such limitations, not only in meditation, but also in everyday life.
The most important elements in Acem's psychological understanding of the technique are explained in the book "Inner Strength — the free mental attitude in Acem Meditation".
History.
Are Holen learned deep meditation (later called Transcendental Meditation) from Mahesh Yogi in 1962 and in January 1966 founded the Academic Meditation Society, precursor to the Acem School of Meditation, at the University of Oslo.
At first, he represented Mahesh Yogi in Norway, but Acem soon distanced itself from the transcendental meditation movement due to disagreements about methods and ideology.

Lectio Divina 
In Western Christianity, Lectio Divina (Latin for "Divine Reading") is a traditional monastic practice of scriptural reading, meditation and prayer intended to promote communion with God and to increase the knowledge of God's word.
In the view of one commentator, it does not treat Scripture as texts to be studied, but as the living word.
Traditionally, "Lectio Divina" has four separate steps: read; meditate; pray; contemplate.
First a passage of Scripture is read, then its meaning is reflected upon.
This is followed by prayer and contemplation on the Word of God.
The focus of "Lectio Divina" is not a theological analysis of biblical passages but viewing them with Christ as the key to their meaning.
For example, given Jesus' statement in : "Peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you", an analytical approach would focus on the reason for the statement during the Last Supper, the biblical context, etc.
In "Lectio Divina", however, the practitioner "enters" and shares the peace of Christ rather than "dissecting" it.
In some Christian teachings, this form of meditative prayer is understood as leading to an increased knowledge of Christ.
The roots of scriptural reflection and interpretation go back to Origen in the 3rd century, after whom Ambrose taught them to Augustine of Hippo.
The monastic practice of "Lectio Divina" was first established in the 6th century by Benedict of Nursia and was then formalized as a four-step process by the Carthusian monk Guigo II during the 12th century.
In the 20th century, the constitution "Dei verbum" of the Second Vatican Council recommended "Lectio Divina" to the general public and its importance was affirmed by Pope Benedict XVI at the start of the 21st century.
History and development.
Early beginnings.
Before the beginning of the Western monastic communities, a key contribution to the foundation of "Lectio Divina" came from Origen in the 3rd century, with his view of "Scripture as a sacrament".
In a letter to Gregory of Neocaesarea Origen wrote: "[W]hen you devote yourself to the divine reading ... seek the meaning of divine words which is hidden from most people".
Origen believed that The Word (i.e. "Logos") was incarnate in Scripture and could therefore touch and teach readers and hearers.
Origen taught that the reading of Scripture could help move beyond elementary thoughts and discover the higher wisdom hidden in the "Word of God".
In Origen's approach the major interpretive element of Scripture is Christ.
In his view all Scriptural texts are secondary to Christ and are only revelations in as much as they refer to Christ as The Word of God.
In this view, using Christ as the "interpretive key" unlocks the message in Scriptural texts.
The "primordial role" of Origen in interpreting Scripture was acknowledged by Pope Benedict XVI.
Origen's methods were then learned by Ambrose of Milan, who towards the end of the 4th century taught them to Saint Augustine, thereby introducing them into the monastic traditions of the Western Church thereafter.
In the 4th century, as the Desert Fathers began to seek God in the deserts of Palestine and Egypt, they produced early models of Christian monastic life that persisted in the Eastern Church.
These early communities gave rise to the tradition of a Christian life of "constant prayer" in a monastic setting.
Although the desert monks gathered to hear Scripture recited in public, and would then recite those words privately in their cells, this was not the same practice as what later became "Lectio Divina" since it involved no meditative step.
6th- to 12th-century monasticism.
After Origen, Church Fathers such as St. Ambrose, St. Augustine, and St. Hilary of Poitiers used the terms "Lectio Divina" and "Lectio Sacra" to refer to the reading of Scripture.
According to Jean Leclercq, OSB, the founders of the medieval tradition of "Lectio Divina" were Saint Benedict and Pope Gregory I.
However, the methods that they employed had precedents in the biblical period both in Hebrew and Greek.
A text that combines these traditions is where Apostle Paul refers to the presence of God's word in the believer's "mouth or heart".
It was the recitation of the biblical text that provided the rationale for "Lectio Divina".
With the motto "Ora et labora" ("Pray and work"), daily life in a Benedictine monastery consisted of three elements: liturgical prayer, manual labor and "Lectio Divina", a quiet prayerful reading of the Bible.
This slow and thoughtful reading of Scripture, and the ensuing pondering of its meaning, was their meditation.
This spiritual practice is called "divine reading" or "spiritual reading"i.e. "lectio divina".
Benedict wrote "Idleness is the enemy of the soul.
Therefore, the brethren should have specified periods of manual labor as well as for prayerful reading ["lectio divina"]."
The Rule of Saint Benedict (chapter #48) stipulated specific times and manners for "Lectio Divina".
The entire community in a monastery was to take part in the readings during Sunday, except those who had other tasks to perform.
Early in the 12th century, Saint Bernard of Clairvaux was instrumental in re-emphasizing the importance of "Lectio Divina" within the Cistercian order.
Bernard considered "Lectio Divina" and contemplation guided by the Holy Spirit the keys to nourishing Christian spirituality.
Formalization during the late 12th century.
The progression from Bible reading, to meditation, to prayer, to loving regard for God, was first formally described by Guigo II, a Carthusian monk and prior of Grande Chartreuse who died late in the 12th century.
The Carthusian order follows its own Rule, called the Statutes, rather than the Rule of St Benedict.
Guigo II's book "The Ladder of Monks" is subtitled "a letter on the contemplative life" and is considered the first description of methodical prayer in the western mystical tradition.
In Guigo's four stages one first reads, which leads to think about (i.e. meditate on) the significance of the text; that process in turn leads the person to respond in prayer as the third stage.
The fourth stage is when the prayer, in turn, points to the gift of quiet stillness in the presence of God, called contemplation.
Guigo named the four steps of this "ladder" of prayer with the Latin terms "lectio", "meditatio", "oratio", and "contemplatio".
In the 13th century the Carmelite Rule of St. Albert prescribed to Carmelites the daily prayerful pondering on the Word of God, namely to ruminate day and night the Divine Law.
"Lectio Divina" alongside the daily celebration of liturgy is to this day the pillar of prayer in Carmel.
"Lectio Divina" was practiced by St. Dominic de Guzman, founder of the Dominican order.
In the 14th century, Gerard of Zutphen built on "Guigo's Ladder" to write his major work "On Spiritual Ascents".
Zutphen warned against considered meditation without reading of Scripture, and taught that the reading prepares the mind, so meditation will not fall into error.
Similarly, he taught that meditation prepares the mind for contemplation.
16th century.
By the beginning of the 16th century, the methods of "methodical prayer" had reached Spain and St. John of the Cross taught the four stages of Guigo II to his monks.
During the century, Protestant Reformers such as John Calvin continued to advocate the "Lectio Divina".
A Reformed version of the "Lectio Divina" was also popular among the Puritans: Richard Baxter, a Puritan theologian, championed the practice.
20th- and 21st-century revival.
By the middle of 19th century, the historical critical approach to biblical analysis which had started over a century earlier, and focused on determining the historicity of gospel episodes, had taken away some of the emphasis on spreading "Lectio Divina" outside monastic communities.
However, the early part of the 20th century witnessed a revival in the practice, and books and articles on "Lectio Divina" aimed at the general public began to appear by the middle of the century.
In 1965, one of the principal documents of the Second Vatican Council, the dogmatic constitution "Dei verbum" ("Word of God") emphasized the use of "Lectio Divina".
On the 40th anniversary of "Dei verbum" in 2005, Pope Benedict XVI reaffirmed its importance and stated: 
In his November 6, 2005 Angelus address, Benedict XVI emphasized the role of the Holy Spirit in "Lectio Divina": In his annual Lenten addresses to the priests of the Diocese of Rome, Pope Benedict – mainly after the 2008 Synod of Bishops on the Bible – emphasized "Lectio Divina" importance, as in 2012, when he used Ephesians 4:1–16 on a speech about certain problems facing the Church.
Beforehand, he and Pope John Paul II had used a question-and-answer format.
"One condition for "Lectio Divina" is that the mind and heart be illumined by the Holy Spirit, that is, by the same Spirit who inspired the Scriptures, and that they be approached with an attitude of 'reverential hearing'."
Since the latter part of the 20th century, the popularity of "Lectio Divina" has increased outside monastic circles and many lay Catholics, as well as some Protestants, practice it, at times keeping a "Lectio journal" in which they record their thoughts and contemplations after each session.
The importance of "Lectio Divina" is stressed in the Anglican Communion as well.
The four movements of "Lectio Divina".
Historically, "Lectio Divina" has been a "community practice" performed by monks in monasteries.
Although it can be taken up individually, its community element should not be forgotten.
"Lectio Divina" has been likened to "feasting on the Word": first, the taking of a bite ("lectio"); then chewing on it ("meditatio"); savoring its essence ("oratio") and, finally, "digesting" it and making it a part of the body ("contemplatio").
In Christian teachings, this form of meditative prayer leads to an increased knowledge of Christ.
Unlike meditative practices in Eastern Christianity – for instance, hesychasm, where the Jesus Prayer is repeated many times – "Lectio Divina" uses different Scripture passages at different times.
Although a passage may be repeated a few times, "Lectio Divina" is not essentially repetitive in nature.
"Lectio" ("reading").
The first step is the reading of Scripture.
In order to achieve a calm and tranquil state of mind, preparation before "Lectio Divina" is recommended.
The biblical reference for preparation via stillness is : "Be still, and know that I am God."
An example would be sitting quietly and in silence and reciting a prayer inviting the Holy Spirit to guide the reading of the Scripture that is to follow.
The biblical basis for the preparation goes back to which emphasizes the role of the Holy Spirit in revealing the Word of God.
As in the statement by John the Baptist in that "in the midst of you standeth one whom ye know not," the preparatory step should open the mind to finding Christ in the passage being read.
Following the preparation the first movement of "Lectio Divina" is slow and gradual reading of the scriptural passage, perhaps several times.
The biblical basis for the reading goes back to and the presence of God's word in the believer's "mouth or heart".
The attentive reading begins the process through which a higher level of understanding can be achieved.
In the traditional Benedictine approach the passage is slowly read four times, each time with a slightly different focus.
"Meditatio" ("meditation").
Although "Lectio Divina" involves reading, it is less a practice of reading than one of listening to the inner message of the Scripture delivered through the Holy Spirit.
"Lectio Divina" does not seek information or motivation, but communion with God.
It does not treat Scripture as text to be studied, but as the "Living Word".
The second movement in "Lectio Divina" thus involves meditating upon and pondering on the scriptural passage.
When the passage is read, it is generally advised not to try to assign a meaning to it at first, but to wait for the action of the Holy Spirit to illuminate the mind, as the passage is pondered upon.
The English word "ponder" comes from the Latin "pondus" which relates to the mental activity of weighing or considering.
To ponder on the passage that has been read, it is held lightly and gently considered from various angles.
Again, the emphasis is not on analysis of the passage but to keep the mind open and allow the Holy Spirit to inspire a meaning for it.
An example passage may be the statement by Jesus during the Last Supper in : "Peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you".
An analytical approach would focus on why Jesus said that, the fact that it was said at the Last Supper, and the context within the biblical episode.
Other theological analysis may follow, e.g. the cost at which Jesus the Lamb of God provided peace through his obedience to the will of the Father, etc. 
However, these theological analyses are generally avoided in "Lectio Divina", where the focus is on Christ as the key that interprets the passage and relates it to the meditator.
So rather than "dissecting peace" in an analytical manner, the practitioner of "Lectio Divina" "enters peace" and shares the peace of Christ.
The focus will thus be on achieving peace via a closer communion with God rather than a biblical analysis of the passage.
Similar other passages may be "Abide in my love", "I am the Good Shepherd", etc. 
"Oratio" ("prayer").
In the Christian tradition, prayer is understood as dialogue with God, that is, as loving conversation with God who has invited us into an embrace.
The constitution "Dei verbum" which endorsed "Lectio Divina" for the general public, as well as in monastic settings, quoted Saint Ambrose on the importance of prayer in conjunction with Scripture reading and stated: 
Pope Benedict XVI emphasized the importance of using "Lectio Divina" and prayers on Scripture as a guiding light and a source of direction and stated "It should never be forgotten that the Word of God is a lamp for our feet and a light for our path."
"Contemplatio" ("contemplation").
Contemplation takes place in terms of silent prayer that expresses love for God.
The Catechism of the Catholic Church defines contemplative prayer as "the hearing the Word of God" in an attentive mode.
It states "Contemplative prayer is , the 'symbol of the world to come' or 'silent love.'
Words in this kind of prayer are not speeches; they are like kindling that feeds the fire of love.
In this silence, unbearable to the 'outer' man, the Father speaks to us his incarnate Word, who suffered, died, and rose; in this silence the Spirit of adoption enables us to share in the prayer of Jesus."
The role of the Holy Spirit in contemplative prayer has been emphasized by Christian spiritual writers for centuries.
In the 12th century, Saint Bernard of Clairvaux compared the Holy Spirit to a kiss by the Eternal Father which allows the practitioner of contemplative prayer to experience union with God.
In the 14th century, Richard Rolle viewed contemplation as the path that leads the soul to union with God in love, and considered the Holy Spirit as the center of contemplation.
From a theological perspective, God's grace is considered a principle, or cause, of contemplation, with its benefits delivered through the gifts of the Holy Spirit.
Other Christian methods.
While the "Lectio Divina" has been the key method of meditation and contemplation within the Benedictine, Cistercian and Carthusian orders, other Catholic religious orders have used other methods.
An example is another four-step approach, that by Saint Clare of Assisi shown in the Table 1, which is used by the Franciscan order.
Saint Clare's method is more visual than Guigo II's which seems more intellectual in comparison.
Saint Teresa of Avila's method of "recollection" which uses book passages to keep focus during meditation has similarities to the way "Lectio Divina" uses a specific Scriptural passage as the centerpiece of a session of meditation and contemplation.
It is likely that Teresa did not initially know of Guigo II's methods, although she may have been indirectly influenced by those teachings via the works of Francisco de Osuna which she studied in detail.
Soham (Sanskrit) 
Soham or Sohum ( "") is a Hindu mantra, meaning "I am He/She/That" in Sanskrit.
In Vedic philosophy it means identifying oneself with the universe or ultimate reality.
The mantra is also inverted from ' (the sandhi of ') to '.
The combination of ' has also been interpreted as "I myself am the Swan", where the swan symbolizes the Atman.
Etymology.
An etymology of ' "swan, goose" as from ' "I am that" is found in the 14th century commentary on the Vedas by Sayana (14th century).
The term ' is related to , and the phrase translates to "I that very person", according to Monier-Williams.
Interpreted as a nominal sentence, it can also be read as "I am She/He" or "It/She/He is I".
The term is found in Vedic literature, and is a phrase that identifies "oneself with the universe or ultimate reality".
History.
This phrase is found in Principal Upanishads such as the Isha Upanishad (verse 16), which ends: 
Soham, or "I am She/He", is very common in ancient and medieval literature.
Some examples include: 
Upanishads 
Tantras 
Stotras 
Adi Shankara's "Vakya Vritti" subsequent works in the Nath tradition foundational for Hatha yoga.
as well as the classical yoga treatises "Gheranda Samhita" and "Shiva Samhita" all make mention of "soham" and "hamsa" describing its significance and when teaching uniformly teaches So on inhalation and ham on exhalation.
This traditional practice in its several forms and its background is described in numerous other books.
Hamsa.
Swami Muktananda - although teaching the traditional So on inhalation and ham on exhalation as a letter from 1968 to Franklin Jones reveals - later published a book teaching Ham on inhalation and sa on exhalation.
This practice is described in several later books all referring to Muktananda.
The teaching of Ham on inhalation and sa on exhalation is allegedly alluded to in a text of Kaśmir Śaivism, the "Vijnana Bhairava": 
However, this verse 155b is not found in the "Vijnana Bhairava" first published in 1918 in the Kashmir Series of Text and Studies but is quoted from a commentary by the Abhinavagupta disciple Kṣemarāja in his "Shiva Sutra Vimarshini" (commentary on the Shiva Sutras) in later editions of "Vijnana Bhairava".
Yoga.
When used for meditation, "Sohum" acts as a natural mantra to control one's breathing pattern, to help achieve deep breath, and to gain concentration.
Soham is also considered a mantra in Tantrism and Kriya Yoga, known also as "Ajapa mantra", "Ajapa Gayatri", "Hamsa Gayatri", "Hamsa mantra", "prana mantra", "Shri Paraprasada mantra", "paramatma-mantra", and as such used notably on its own, in the meditation practice ajapa japa and in the kriya practice shabda sanchalana.
Ananda Yoga 
Ananda Yoga, or "Ananda Yoga for Higher Awareness" is a system of Hatha Yoga established by Kriyananda, a Western disciple of Paramahansa Yogananda, and is based on Yogananda's Self-Realization Fellowship (SRF) and Yogoda Satsanga Society of India (YSS) teachings.
Ananda Yoga emphasizes inner awareness; energy control; and the experience of each asana as a natural expression of a higher state of consciousness, which is enhanced by the use of affirmations.
History.
Ananda Yoga was established by Kriyananda taking from one of the oldest Hatha Yoga systems in the West.
Its roots are the 1940s/1950s, when Kriyananda was with Self-Realization Fellowship, he was taught these postures by Yogananda.
Yogananda, founder of SRF and YSS, asked Kriyananda (then Donald Walters) and other young monks, to demonstrate the postures for visiting guests, as well as for public events, such as the SRF "Lake Shrine Dedication."
Kriyananda and other monks also posed for photos, for articles on the yoga postures in Yogananda's "Self-Realization Magazine."
From 1965 Kriyananda through his own organization started to teach Ananda Yoga publicly in California.
The director of Ananda Yoga, Gyandev Rich McCord, is a co-founder of Yoga Alliance and a member of its board of directors.
Principles.
Ananda Yoga uses asana and pranayama to awaken, experience, and control the subtle energies (prana) within the body, especially the energies of the chakras, supposed energy centres that are arranged along the spine.
Its object is to use those energies to harmonize the body, uplift the mind, and above all to attune to higher levels of awareness.
A unique feature of this system is the use of silent affirmations while in the asanas, as a means of working more consciously with the subtle energies to achieve this attunement.
Ananda Yoga is a relatively inward experience, not an athletic practice.
A main goal is to prepare for deep meditation, as Hatha Yoga is considered the physical branch of Raja Yoga in both the "Hatha Yoga Pradipika" and the "Gheranda Samhita".
Energization exercises.
The "Energization Exercises", a vital part of Ananda Yoga, are Yogananda's contribution to yoga.
He first developed them in 1916, within his organization then called Yogoda, which he changed to Self-Realization Fellowship / Yogoda Satsanga Society of India in the 1930s.
He eventually expanded them into a set of 39 exercises.
The goal is to tap into cosmic energy, recharging the whole body.
Yogananda explains in his "Autobiography of a Yogi": "Realizing that man's body is like an electric battery, I reasoned that it could be recharged with energy through the direct agency of the human will….
I therefore taught the Ranchi students my simple 'Yogoda' techniques by which the life force, centered in man’s medulla oblongata, can be consciously and instantly recharged from the unlimited supply of cosmic energy."
Self-enquiry (Ramana Maharshi) 
Self-enquiry, also spelled self-inquiry (Sanskrit "vichara", also called "jnana-vichara" or ""), is the constant attention to the inner awareness of "I" or "I am" recommended by Ramana Maharshi as the most efficient and direct way of discovering the unreality of the "I"-thought.
Ramana Mahirishi taught that the "I"-thought will disappear and only "I-I" or self-awareness remains.
This results in an "effortless awareness of being", and by staying with it this "I-I" gradually destroys the vasanas "which cause the 'I'-thought to rise," and finally the 'I'-thought never rises again, which is Self-realization or liberation.
Etymology.
Vichāra (Sanskrit: विचार) means deliberation; its root is वि (prefix to verbs and nouns it expresses) – चर् (to move, roam, obtain knowledge of).
It is the faculty of discrimination between right and wrong; it is deliberation about cause and effect, and the final analysis; it is also the enquiry into the nature of the Atman, Satya, Ishvara and Brahman.
This Sanskrit word, "Vichāra", does not have a corresponding word in English.
"Vichāra" is reflection and contemplation upon the meaning of Vedantic truths, and leads the individual to true knowledge, it leads to Brahman, the Universal Self.
"Vichara" is also called "jnana-vichara" or "" by his devotees.
"Ātman" (IAST: ātman, Sanskrit: आत्मन्) is a Sanskrit word that is usually translated as "self".
The root *ēt-men (breath) is cognate with Old English "æþm", Greek "asthma", German "Atem": "atmen" (to breathe).
It is derived from Latin "anima" (breath, soul), which is cognate to Sanskrit "ánilaḥ" (wind).
Although "ánilaḥ" and "ātman" have similar meaning, they are not etymologically related.
In Hindu philosophy, especially in the Vedanta school of Hinduism, Ātman is the first principle, the "true" self of an individual beyond identification with phenomena, the essence of an individual.
To attain salvation (liberation), a human being must acquire self-knowledge (atma jnana), which is to realise that one's true self (Ātman) is identical with the transcendent self Brahman (or paramatman).
Strictly speaking, "self-enquiry" is not the investigation of the "Self", "Atman", but of the "I", "aham" (Sanskrit), "nan" (Tamil).
Origins.
Ramana Maharshi.
Ramana's teachings on Self-enquiry originated in his own awakening at age 16, when he became firmly aware of death.
It made him aware of the Self.
Ramana summarised his insight into "aham sphurana" (Self-awareness) to a visitor in 1945: 
At first, Ramana thought that he was possessed by a spirit, "which had taken up residence in his body".
This feeling remained for several weeks.
Later in life, he called his death experience "akrama mukti", "sudden liberation", as opposed to the "krama mukti", "gradual liberation" as in the Vedanta path of jnana yoga: 
Hinduism.
According to David Frawley, "atma-vichara" is the most important practice in the Advaita Vedanta tradition, predating its popularisation by Ramana Maharshi.
It is part of the eighth limb of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, which describes the various stages of samadhi.
Meditation on "I-am-ness" is a subtle object of meditation in "savikalpa samadhi".
It is also described in the "Yoga Vasistha", a syncretic work which may date from the 6th or 7th century CE, and shows influences from Yoga, Samkhya, Saiva Siddhanta and Mahayana Buddhism, especially Yogacara.
Practice.
Chasing the I. 
Ramana taught that by paying close attention to the 'I'-thought, this 'I'-thought will disappear and only "I-I" or Self-awareness remains.
This results in an "effortless awareness of being", and by staying with it this "I-I" gradually destroys the vasanas "which cause the 'I'-thought to rise," and finally the 'I'-thought never rises again, which is Self-realization or liberation.
Ramana gave upadesa, "instruction or guidance given to a disciple by his Guru", pointing to the true Self of the devotees and showing them the truth of it.
As author and long-time devotee David Godman explains, 
Self-enquiry can be practised at all times:  
Self is awareness.
Ramana stated that the Self is awareness:  
Giving up awareness of not-self leads to pure awareness: 
Textual references.
Ramana's written works contain terse descriptions of self-enquiry.
Verse thirty of "Ulladu Narpadu": 
Verses nineteen and twenty of "Upadesa Undiyar" describe the same process in almost identical terms: 
Vichara Sangraham (Self-Enquiry): 
Transcription of Ramana's explanations.
Early on, Ramana attracted devotees who would sit in his company, and ask him questions.
Several devotees recorded the answers to their own specific questions, or kept the sheets of paper on which Ramana answered, and had them later published.
Other devotees recorded the talks between Ramana and devotees, a large amount of which have also been published.
Ramana "never felt moved to formulate his teaching of his own accord, either verbally or in writing".
The few writings he's credited with "came into being as answers to questions asked by his disciples or through their urging".
Only a few hymns were written on his own initiative.
Ramana's earliest teachings are documented in the book "Nan Yar?"(Who am I?), in which he elaborates on the "I" and Self-enquiry.
The original book was first written in Tamil, and published by Sri Pillai.
The essay version of the book ("Sri Ramana Nutrirattu") prepared by Ramana is considered definitive, as unlike the original it had the benefit of his revision and review.
"Nan Yar" was documented by his disciple M. Sivaprakasam Pillai, who was already heavily influenced by traditional Advaita, and so had added notes about the traditional Advaitic negation method for his own clarification; these additional notes were later removed by Ramana.
A careful translation with notes is available in English as 'The Path of Sri Ramana, Part One' by Sri Sadhu Om, one of the direct disciples of Ramana.
Vihangamyoga 
Vihangam Yoga is an Indian school of yoga and meditation with branches in over 50 countries.
It claims to teach an ancient Indian meditation technique.
The school was founded by Sadguru Sadafal Deo Ji Maharaj in 1924 and has some 60,00,000members.
Vihangam Yoga is an ancient meditation technique, as old as the creation itself, which was revived by Sadguru Sadafal Deo Ji Maharaj.
The Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) of the United Nations awarded "special consultative status" to Sadguru Sadafal Deo Vihangam Yoga Sansthan in Allahabad in 2013, among 160 other organisations.
A controlled trial on the effects of Vihangam Yoga meditation in 15 practitioners with at least ten years' experience, compared to matched control subjects, showed that the yogis performed better on average on each test of attention, namely attention span, processing speed, attention alternation ability, and performance in interference tests.
Meditative poetry 
Meditative poetry combines the religious practice of meditation with verse.
Buddhist and Hindu writers have developed extensive theories and phase models for meditation (Bevis 1988; 73-88).
In Christianity, meditation became a major devotional practice during the Middle Ages, closely associated with the life in monasteries.
Definitions vary, but there were various attempts to distinguish meditation from contemplation.
While meditation focuses the mind on a text, preferably from the Bible, contemplation will take a concrete object, such as a candle, to concentrate the thoughts of the mind.
Both contemplation and meditation had the same end, to seek unity with God.
During the Protestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation, Jesuits like Ignatius of Loyola formalized the process of meditation, as a channeling of memory, understanding, and will.
His method of meditation fell into three main parts: A) prayer and composition of place; B) the examination of points (analysis); C) the colloquies (the dialogue with God as a climax) (Martz 1962, 27-32).
Jesuits brought this practice to England (Daly 1978: 72).
Calvinist and other Protestants adapted meditation to Bible studies.
Puritan meditation emphasized self-examination, applying Bible verses to contemporary, everyday life.
In 1628, Thomas Taylor wrote a Puritan handbook "Meditation from the Creatures", recommending to include images from the sensible world (metaphorical of God's glory).
In colonial New England, Thomas Hooker defined meditation in "The Souls Preparation for Christ" (1632) as follows: "It is a settled exercise for two ends: first to make a further inquiry of the truth: and secondly, to make the heart affected therewith."
In 1648, batman university made meditation a duty for Puritans, and in 1649/50 Richard Baxter 's "The Saints' Everlasting Rest" became the standard Puritan text, at its core prescribing meditation.
Like Taylor and Hooker, Baxter admitted the use of the senses; that is, he included contemplation with meditation, based on figural correspondences with the Bible.
By including contemplation with meditation, the Puritans laid the foundation for a rich tradition of verse meditation in the USA from its colonial beginnings to the twenty-first century (Daly 1978, 74-76, 79-81; Martz 1962).
Soon Puritan ministers like Edward Taylor began to write meditations in verse, based on lines from the Bible and on sense perceptions, both allegorical of the greater glory of God.
Anne Bradstreet provided the first published meditations purely based on the senses, celebrating nature's beauties as the creation of God.
Using the analogy of Nature as God's second book, poetic meditations gradually secularized, replacing the old allegoric technique with a more symbolic reading of nature and affirming the self-reliant individual (Pearce 1961, 42-57).
Ralph Waldo Emerson 's essay "Nature" (1836) freed the meditation from its theological underpinnings and its reliance on the Bible.
He encouraged poets to view nature as a storehouse of symbols that they could use merely relying on their imagination.
Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson took meditation into this direction and paved the way for Modernist and Postmodernist practices in poetry (Lawson 1994).
The method of the three main steps (the composition of place, examination of points, colloquies) had survived into the twentieth century in many poems, as had the devotional practice of verse meditation.
Leading modernist poets like T. S. Eliot and Wallace Stevens began to fragmentize the process, blending thoughts and sense perceptions in a sort of spiritual diary (Parini 1993,12).
Postmodernist poets like John Ashbery deconstruct the contemplative aspect, the reference of the poem to an object outside itself, dissolving narrative or episodic structures of the spiritual diary in an ironic and open association (Bevis 1988:280-90), and thereby turning the poem itself into the object the reader can use for contemplation or meditation.
Meditative poetry has often been correlated to Relaxation Through Poetry, which is simply using poetry to relax or relieve stress whenever someone is in need.
It can also be seen in group visualization sessions where a speaker tries to get the audience to forget all about their stress by the use of calm and relaxing poetry.
Bibliography 
Transpersonal psychology 
Transpersonal psychology, or spiritual psychology, is a sub-field or school of psychology that claims to integrate the spiritual and transcendent aspects of the human experience with the framework of modern psychology.
The "transpersonal" is defined as "experiences in which the sense of identity or self extends beyond (trans) the individual or personal to encompass wider aspects of humankind, life, psyche or cosmos".
It has also been defined as "development beyond conventional, personal or individual levels".
Issues considered in transpersonal psychology include spiritual self-development, self beyond the ego, peak experiences, mystical experiences, systemic trance, spiritual crises, spiritual evolution, religious conversion, altered states of consciousness, spiritual practices, and other sublime and/or unusually expanded experiences of living.
The discipline attempts to describe and integrate spiritual experience within modern psychological theory and to formulate new theory to encompass such experience.
The Transpersonal Psychology Day is celebrated on February 27.
History.
Origins.
In 1968 Abraham Maslow was among the people who announced transpersonal psychology as a "fourth force" in psychology, in order to separate it from Humanistic psychology.
Early use of the term "transpersonal" can also be credited to Stanislav Grof and Anthony Sutich.
At this time, in 1967–68, Maslow was in close dialogue with both Grof and Sutich regarding the name and orientation of the new field.
According to Powers the term "transpersonal" starts to show up in academic journals from 1970 onwards.
Both Humanistic and Transpersonal psychology have been associated with the Human Potential Movement, a growth center for alternative therapies and philosophies that grew out of the counter-culture of the 1960s at places such as Esalen, California.
Formative period.
Gradually, during the 1960s, the term "transpersonal" was associated with a distinct school of psychology within the humanistic psychology movement.
In 1969, Maslow, Grof and Sutich were among the initiators behind the publication of the first issue of the "Journal of Transpersonal Psychology".
The Association for Transpersonal Psychology was established in 1972, the International Transpersonal Psychology Association in 1973, and the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology in 1975 .
The institute was founded by Robert Frager and James Fadiman in response to the academic climate that was hostile to such ideas.
Soon other institutions begain offering curricula in transpersonal psychology including Saybrook Graduate School, the California Institute of Asian Studies (now California Institute of Integral Studies), JFK University, and Naropa.
Other proponents of transpersonal psychology included Ram Dass, a popular Guru; Elmer and Alyce Green who were affiliated with the Menninger Foundation; and Ken Wilber.
An early preoccupation of those interested in transpersonal psychology was meditation and altered states of consciousness including those induced from psychedelic drugs.
In the early 1980s a group within APA division 32 (Humanistic Psychology) argued in favor of establishing transpersonal psychology as a separate division within the framework of the "American Psychological Association".
A petition was presented to the APA Council in 1984, but was turned down.
A new initiative was made in 1985, but it failed to win the majority of votes in the council.
In 1986 the petition was presented for a third and final time, but was withdrawn by the executive board of Division 32.
The interest group later re-formed as the Transpersonal Psychology Interest Group (TPIG), and continued to promote transpersonal issues in collaboration with Division 32.
Ken Wilber and Michael Washburn delivered the main transpersonal models of development of this period, Wilber in 1977 and Washburn in 1988.
Ken Wilber has been distancing himself from the label of "transpersonal", in favour of the label of "integral", since the mid-1990s.
In 1998 he formed Integral Institute.
Later developments.
Proponents of transpersonal psychology were behind the proposal for a new diagnostic category to be included in the DSM-manual of the American Psychiatric Association.
The category was called "Psychoreligious or psychospiritual problem" and was approved by the Task Force on DSM-IV in 1993, after changing its name to "Religious or spiritual problem".
Concurrently, there was an increase in membership for the "Association for Transpersonal Psychology", stabilizing at approximately 3000 members in the early nineties.
In 1996, the "British Psychological Society" established a Transpersonal Psychology Section.
In 2007 the "Journal of Transpersonal Psychology" and the "International Journal of Transpersonal Studies" were accepted for indexing in PsycINFO, the journal database of the American Psychological Association.
However, that same year, Ruzek, who conducted interviews with founders of Transpersonal Psychology, as well as historians of American psychology, noted that the "American Psychological Association (APA) and most academic institutions have not yet recognized transpersonal psychology as an approved area of study; transpersonal psychology is rarely mentioned in mainstream academic journals or textbooks; and relatively few American academicians identify themselves as practitioners of transpersonal psychology.
Furthermore, transpersonal psychology is scarcely mentioned, if at all, in history or introductory psychology texts".
In 2012 the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology announced that it was changing its name to Sofia University with an expanded graduate program featuring computer science and business.
In 2016, the California Institute of Integral Studies launched an online PhD degree in Integral and Transpersonal Psychology, founded and chaired by Glenn Hartelius, including Jorge Ferrer on its faculty, and sponsoring publication of the International Journal of Transpersonal Studies.
Branches and related fields.
Other transpersonal disciplines, such as transpersonal anthropology and transpersonal business studies, are listed as transpersonal disciplines.
Other fields of study that are related to transpersonal psychology, include near-death studies and parapsychology.
A few commentators have suggested that there is a difference between transpersonal psychology and a broader category of transpersonal theories, sometimes called transpersonal studies.
According to Friedman this category might include several approaches to the transpersonal that lie outside the frames of science.
However, according to Ferrer the field of transpersonal psychology is "situated within the wider umbrella of transpersonal studies".
Transpersonal psychology may also be associated with New Age beliefs and pop psychology.
However, leading authors in the field, among those Sovatsky, Rowan, and Hartelius have criticized the nature of "New Age"-philosophy and discourse.
Rowan even states that "The Transpersonal is not the New Age".
Other commentators, such as Wade, notes that the field remains part of the New Age, despite the fact that transpersonal psychologists may want no such association.
Although some consider that the distinction between transpersonal psychology and the psychology of religion is fading (e.g.
The Oxford Handbook of Psychology and Spirituality), there is still generally considered to be a clear distinction between the two.
Much of the focus of psychology of religion is concerned with issues that would not be considered 'transcendent' within transpersonal psychology, so the two disciplines have quite distinct focuses.
Organizations, publications and locations.
Although the perspective of transpersonal psychology has spread to a number of interest groups across the US and Europe, its origins were in California, and the field has always been strongly associated with institutions on the west coast of the US.
Both the Association for Transpersonal Psychology and the forerunner to Sofia University were founded in the state of California, and a number of the fields leading theorists come from this area of the US.
A European counterpart to the American institution, the European Transpersonal Psychology Association (ETPA), was founded much later.
Leading publications include the "Journal of Transpersonal Psychology" and the "International Journal of Transpersonal Studies".
Smaller publications include the "Transpersonal Psychology Review", the journal of the Transpersonal Psychology Section of the British Psychological Society.
Reception, recognition and criticism.
Reception of Transpersonal psychology in the surrounding culture reflects a wide range of views and opinions, including severe skepticism.
Ernest Hilgard, representing the contemporary psychology of the early 1980s, regarded transpersonal psychology as a fringe movement that attracted the more extreme followers of Humanistic psychology.
He did however remark that such movements might enrich the topics that psychologists study, even though most psychologists choose not to join the movement.
Adams also regarded Transpersonal psychology as a fringe discipline.
He also observed its status as a controversial field of study.
Eugene Taylor, representing the field of Humanistic Psychology, presented a balanced review of transpersonal psychology in the early nineties.
On the negative side he mentioned transpersonal Psychology's tendency toward being "philosophically naive, poorly financed, at times almost anti-intellectual, and frequently overrated as far as its influences".
On the positive side he noted the fields "integrated approach to understanding the phenomenology of scientific method"; the "centrality of qualitative research"; and the "importance of interdisciplinary communication".
In conclusion he suggested that the virtues of transpersonal psychology may, in the end, "outweigh its defects".
In a later article Taylor regarded transpersonal psychology as a visionary American folk-psychology with little historical relation to American academic psychology, except through its association with Humanistic psychology and the categories of transcendence and consciousness.
Although transpersonal psychology has experienced some minor recognition from the surrounding culture, it faces a fair amount of skepticism and criticism from the same surroundings.
Freeman mentions that the early field of transpersonal psychology was aware of the possibility that it would be rejected by the scientific community.
Its method of inner empiricism, "based on disciplined introspection", was to be a target of skepticism from outsiders in the years to come.
Several commentators have mentioned the controversial aspects of transpersonal psychology.
Zdenek noted that the field was regarded as "controversial since its inception".
Other commentators, such as Friedman, and Adams, also mention the controversial status of the field.
Adams also remarked that the field has struggled for "recognition as a legitimate field of study" in academia.
This aspect was also noticed by Parsons, who observed that Transpersonal psychology's "naive perennialism, misreading of religious texts, lack of methodological sophistication, weak epistemology, and, some would claim, promotion of narcissistic self-absorption" had not been well received by the majority of academics.
Commenting on the state of the field in the mid-nineties Chinen noted that professional publications, until then, had been hesitant to publish articles that dealt with transpersonal subjects.
In 1998 the "San Francisco Chronicle" reported on the holistic studies program at the "John F. Kennedy University" in Orinda, which included a transpersonal psychology department.
The program was considered to be unique at the time, but also controversial.
Commentators presented their skepticism towards the program.
Another contentious aspect concerns the topic of psychedelic substances.
Commenting upon the controversial status of psychedelic and entheogenic substances in contemporary culture, authors Elmer, MacDonald &amp; Friedman observe that these drugs have been used for therapeutic effect in the transpersonal movement, but - the authors add - this is not the most "common form of transpersonal intervention" in contemporary therapy.
However, Bravo and Grob note that "the place of psychedelics in spiritual practice remains controversial".
Ruzek, who interviewed founders of transpersonal psychology, as well as historians of American psychology, found that the field of Transpersonal psychology had made little impact on the larger field of psychology in America.
Among the factors that contributed to this situation was mainstream psychology's "resistance to spiritual and philosophical ideas", and the tendency of Transpersonal psychologists to isolate themselves from the larger context.
One of the earliest criticisms of transpersonal psychology was leveled by the humanistic psychologist Rollo May, who "disputed the conceptual foundations of transpersonal psychology".
May also criticized the field for neglecting the personal dimension of the psyche by elevating the pursuit of the transcendental, and for neglecting the "dark side of human nature".
According to Lukoff and Lu the "American Psychological Association" expressed some concerns about the "unscientific" nature of transpersonal psychology at the time of the petition to the APA (see above).
Rowan notes that the Association had serious reservations about opening up a Transpersonal Psychology Division.
The petitions for divisional status failed to win the majority of votes in the APA council, and the division was never established.
Commentators also mention that transpersonal psychology's association with the ideas of religion was one of the concerns that prohibited it from becoming a separate division of the APA at the time of the petition in 1984.
Transpersonal psychology has been criticized for lacking conceptual, evidentiary, and scientific rigor.
In a review of criticisms of the field, Cunningham writes, "philosophers have criticized transpersonal psychology because its metaphysics is naive and epistemology is undeveloped.
Multiplicity of definitions and lack of operationalization of many of its concepts has led to a conceptual confusion about the nature of transpersonal psychology itself (i.e., the concept is used differently by different theorists and means different things to different people).
Biologists have criticized transpersonal psychology for its lack of attention to biological foundations of behavior and experience.
Physicists have criticized transpersonal psychology for inappropriately accommodating physic concepts as explanations of consciousness."
Albert Ellis, a cognitive psychologist and humanist, has questioned the results of transpersonal psychotherapy.
In 1989 he cooperated with Raymond Yeager for the release of "Why some therapies don't work: The dangers of transpersonal psychology", where the authors compared the results of transpersonal psychology with the effects of Rational-Emotive Therapy, noting the dangers of the transpersonal approach.
Ellis has also questioned the scientific status of transpersonal psychology, and its relationship to religion, mysticism and authoritarian belief systems.
Sahaja Yoga 
Sahaja Yoga (सहज योग) is a religion founded in 1970 by Nirmala Srivastava (1923–2011).
Nirmala Srivastava is known as Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi (trans: "Revered Immaculate Mother") or, simply, as "Mother" by her followers, who are called Sahaja yogis.
Practitioners believe that during meditation they experience a state of self-realization produced by kundalini awakening, and that this is accompanied by the experience of thoughtless awareness or mental silence.
Shri Mataji described Sahaja Yoga as the pure, universal religion integrating all other religions.
She claimed that she was a divine incarnation, more precisely an incarnation of the Holy Spirit, or the Adi Shakti of the Hindu tradition, the great mother goddess who had come to save humanity.
This is also how she is regarded by most of her devotees.
Sahaja Yoga has sometimes been characterized as a cult.
Etymology.
The word 'Sahaja' in Sanskrit has two components: 'Saha' is 'with' and 'ja' is 'born'.
"A Dictionary of Buddhism" gives the literal translation of Sahaja as "innate" and defines it as "denoting the natural presence of enlightenment (bodhi) or purity."
and Yoga means "union" "with the divine" and refers to a spiritual path or a state of spiritual absorption.
According to a book published by Sahaja Yogis, Sahaja Yoga means "spontaneous" and "born with you" meaning that the kundalini is born within us and can be awakened spontaneously, without effort.
The term 'Sahaja Yoga' goes back at least to the 15th Century Indian mystic Kabir and has also been used to refer to Surat Shabd Yoga.
History.
Before starting Sahaja Yoga, Shrivastava had a reputation as a spiritual healer.
In 1970, with a small group of devotees around her, she began spreading her message of Sahaja Yoga in India.
As she moved with her husband to London, UK, she continued her religious activities there, and the movement grew and spread throughout Europe, by the mid-80's reaching North America.
In 1989, Shri Mataji made her first trip to Russia and Eastern Europe.
She did not charge for her classes, insisting that her lesson was a birthright which should be freely available to all.
As of 2021, Sahaja Yoga has centers in at least 69 countries.
Beliefs and practices.
The movement claims Sahaja Yoga is different from other yoga/meditations because it begins with self realization through kundalini awakening rather than as a result of performing kriya techniques or asanas.
This self realization is said to be made possible by the presence of Srivastava often through a photography of her.
The teachings, practices and beliefs of Sahaja Yoga are mainly Hindu-based, with a predominance of elements from mystical traditions, as well as local customs of India.
There are however elements of Christian origin, such as the eternal battle between good and evil.
References to a variety of other religious, spiritual, mystical as well as modern scientific frameworks are also interwoven in Srivastava's teachings, although to a lesser degree.
Religious sociologist Judith Coney has reported facing a challenge in getting behind what she called "the public facade" of Sahaja Yoga.
She described Sahaja yogis as adopting a low profile with uncommitted individuals to avoid unnecessary conflict.
Coney observed that the movement tolerates a variety of world views and levels of commitment with some practitioners choosing to remain on the periphery.
Kundalini.
Within the Indian mystic tradition, kundalini awakening has long been a much sought-after goal that was thought rare and hard to attain.
Sahaja Yoga is distinctive in claiming to offer a quick and easy path to such an awakening.
Meditation.
Meditation is one of the foundational rituals within Sahaja Yoga.
The technique taught emphasises the state of "thoughtless-awareness" that is said to be achieved.
Role of women.
Judith Coney has written that in general, Nirmala Srivastava's vision for the role of women within Sahaja Yoga was one of "feminine domesticity and compliance".
Some parents of Sahaja 'yogists', analyzing Nirmala Srivastava's remarks, noted that women play a subordinate role.
The texts of Nirmala Srivastava say that "if you are a woman and you want to dominate, then Sahaja Yoga will have difficulty in curing you" and that women should be "docile" and "domestic".
Judith Coney writes that women "are valued as mothers and wives but are limited to these roles and are not encouraged to be active or powerful, except within the domestic sphere and behind the scenes".
Coney has observed that "Gender roles for women and men within Sahaja Yoga are clearly specified and highly segregated, and positions of authority in the group are held almost exclusively by the men".
Coney writes that the ideal of womanhood promoted within Sahaja Yoga draws both on the ideal wifely qualities of the goddess Lakshmi and on wider Hindu traditions.
Coney believes these traditions are summed up in "The Code of Manu" which holds that woman should be honoured and adorned but kept dependent on men in the family.
Women are also described in this book as "dangerous" and needing to be guarded from temptation.
Coney has written that Nirmala Srivastava did not display consistent views on women but gave a number of messages about the status of women.
On the one hand she said women are not inferior but described the sexes as complementary.
Describing the man as the head of the family, she likened the woman's status to the heart: "The head always feels he decides, but the brain always knows that is the heart one has to cater, it is the heart which is all-pervading, it is the real source of everything".
She regretted what she saw as the loss of respect for women in society in both the East and West.
However, she viewed Western feminism suspiciously, seeing it as a "route to damnation" because it required women to deviate from what she thought was their true nature.
Family.
Human rights lawyer Sylvie Langlaude has described the configuration of families within Sahaja Yoga as "unusual", noting that from birth children become familiarised with the movement's beliefs and Nirmala Srivastava's status by being closely involved in its day-to-day rituals including meditation, foot-soaking, and devotional singing.
The subtle system – chakras and nadis.
Sahaja Yoga believes that in addition to our physical body there is a subtle body composed of nadis (channels) and chakras (energy centres).
Nirmala Srivastava however equates the Sushumna nadi with the parasympathetic nervous system, the Ida nadi with the left and the Pingala nadi with the right sides of the sympathetic nervous system.
Psychoanalyst Sudhir Kakar writes that Nirmala Srivastava's additions to this widespread traditional 'tantric' model include giving it a scientific, neurological veneer, an elaboration of the health aspects and an introduction of notions of traditional Christian morality.
Chakras do not physically exist.
Apostasy.
In common with similar movements, most people who have left the Sahaja Yoga movement do not describe their experience as being unremittingly negative, often finding something positive they can say.
Nevertheless, in interviews with ex-members Judith Coney heard various complaints from ex-members, including that they had experienced unwanted arranged marriage, had been dismayed by the difference between the reality of the movement and what they had expected, and had found their time in the movement frightening.
In general, members who believed that had gained some form of supernatural protection from being in the movement, were fearful of being exposed to retribution for having left, perhaps in the form of a terminal illness or fatal accident.
Eschatology.
Within the Sahaja Yoga belief system, because we are in the final phase of the world (Kali Yuga) before the apocalypse, the Earth is rich in demons, who use satanic forces to possess people, impersonate gurus, and spread evil.
Judith Coney writes that Nirmala Srivastava claimed to be Adi Shakti, who had returned to earth to save it from "demonic influences."
Coney writes that Nirmala Srivastava identified what she saw as increased decadence in society as the work of demons "intent on dragging human beings to hell".
Organization.
Vishwa Nirmala Dharma (trans: Universal Pure Religion, also known as Sahaja Yoga International) is the organizational part of the movement.
It is a registered organization in countries such as Colombia, the United States of America, and Austria.
It is registered as a religion in Spain.
Membership statistics.
There are no available statistical data about Sahaja Yoga membership.
In 2001, the number of core members worldwide was estimated to be 10,000, in addition to 100,000 practitioners more or less in the periphery.
There are varying reports about the movement's distribution worldwide.
According to the Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi Sahaja Yoga World Foundation, Sahaja Yoga centers are established in over 95 countries.
In a news article in Indian Express published on the occasion of Srivastava's death in 2011, however, Sahaja Yoga centers were said to exist in 140 countries.
International Sahaja Public School.
The International Sahaja Public School in Dharamsala founded in 1990, teaches around 250 international students annually , and has accepted children from the age of 6.
Yuvashakti.
Sahaja Yoga's youth movement is called "Yuvashakti" (also "Nirmal Shakti Yuva Sangha"), from the Sanskrit words Yuva (Youth) and Shakti (Power).
The movement is active in forums such as the World Youth Conference and TakingITGlobal which aim at discussing global issues, and ways of solving them.
The Yuvashakti participated in the 2000 "Civil Society &amp; Governance Project" in which they were "instrumental in reaching out to women from the poor communities and providing them with work".
Vishwa Nirmal Prem Ashram.
The "Vishwa Nirmala Prem Ashram" is a not-for profit project by the NGO Vishwa Nirmala Dharma (Sahaja Yoga International) located in Noida, Delhi, India, opened in 2003.
The ashram is a "facility where women and girls are rehabilitated by being taught meditation and other skills that help them overcome trauma".
Funding.
According to the dictates of their founder, the methods for practicing Sahaja Yoga are made available free of charge to those interested.
Nevertheless, according to the official Sahaja Yoga website there is a fee for attending international pujas to cover costs.
According to author David V. Barrett, "Shri Mataji neither charged for her lectures nor for her ability to give Self Realization, nor does one have to become a member of this organization.
She insisted that one cannot pay for enlightenment and she continued to denounce the false self-proclaimed 'gurus' who are more interested in the seekers' purse than their spiritual ascent".
Cult allegations.
Cult expert Jean-Marie Abgrall has written that Sahaja Yoga exhibits the classic characteristics of a cult in the way it conditions its members.
These include having a god-like leader, disrupting existing relationships, and promising security and specific benefits while demanding loyalty and financial support.
Abgrall writes that the true activities of the cult are hidden behind the projection of a positive image and an explicit statement that "Sahaja yoga is not a cult".
Judith Coney has written that members "disguised some of their beliefs" from the outside world.
Coney writes people who had left the movement welcomed the chance to talk to her as an independent researcher, but that some were fearful of reprisals if they did so, and others found their experiences too painful to revisit.
Most were unwilling to talk to her "on the record".
In 2001, "The Independent" reported the allegation made by some ex-members, that Sahaja Yoga is a cult which aims to control the minds of its members.
Ex-members said that the organisation insists all family ties are broken and all communication with them cease, that crying children can be seen as being possessed by demons, that negative and positive vibrations need "clearing", and that being a member of the group is very expensive.
In 2005, "The Record" reported that some critics who feel that the group is a cult have started their own websites.
In 2005 the Belgian State organisation IACSSO () issued an advisory against Sahaja Yoga.
The advisory categorizes Sahaja Yoga as a synretic cult ("syncretische cultus") based on the Hindu tradition, and warns that the recruitment techniques used by Sahaja Yoga pose a risk to the public in general and young people in particular.
Sahaja Yoga Belgium sued IACSSO and preliminary rulings were found in their favour, adjudging that Sahaja Yoga was "not a cult".
However, on appeal in 2011 these preliminary rulings were overturned and in a final judgement it was found that Sahaja Yoga had been unable to refute IACSSO's statements.
In 2013, "De Morgen" reported that the Belgian Department of State Security monitors how often politicians are contacted and lobbied by organizations.
The list of organizations includes Sahaja Yoga.
In 2001, The "Evening Standard" reported that Sahaja Yoga has been "described as a dangerous cult" and "has a dissident website created by former members".
The reporter, John Crace, wrote about an event he attended and noted that a Sahaja Yoga representative asked him to feel free to talk to whomever he wanted.
He remarked, "Either their openness is a PR charm offensive, or they genuinely have nothing to hide."
He proposed that "one of the key definitions of a cult is the rigour with which it strives to recruit new members" and concluded that there was no aggressive recruitment squeeze.
David V. Barrett wrote that some former members say that they were expelled from the movement because they "resisted influence that Mataji had over their lives".
According to Barrett, the movement's founder's degree of control over members' lives has given rise to concerns.
The Austrian Ministry for Environment, Youth and Family states that "Sahaja Yoga" regards Nirmala Srivastava as an authority who cannot be questioned.
Bhakti 
Bhakti () means "attachment, participation, fondness for, homage, faith, love, devotion, worship, purity".
It was originally used in Hinduism, referring to devotion and love for a personal god or a representational god by a devotee.
In ancient texts such as the "Shvetashvatara Upanishad", the term simply means participation, devotion and love for any endeavor, while in the "Bhagavad Gita", it connotes one of the possible paths of spirituality and towards moksha, as in "bhakti marga".
Bhakti in Indian religions is "emotional devotionalism", particularly to a personal god or to spiritual ideas.
Thus, bhakti requires a relationship between the devotee and the deity.
The term also refers to a movement, pioneered by Alvars and Nayanars, that developed around the gods Vishnu (Vaishnavism), Shiva (Shaivism) and Devi (Shaktism) in the second half of the 1st millennium CE.
Bhakti ideas have inspired many popular texts and saint-poets in India.
The "Bhagavata Purana", for example, is a Krishna-related text associated with the Bhakti movement in Hinduism.
Bhakti is also found in other religions practiced in India, and it has influenced interactions between Christianity and Hinduism in the modern era.
"Nirguni bhakti" (devotion to the divine without attributes) is found in Sikhism, as well as Hinduism.
Outside India, emotional devotion is found in some Southeast Asian and East Asian Buddhist traditions, and it is sometimes referred to as "Bhatti".
Terminology.
The Sanskrit word "bhakti" is derived from the verb root "bhaj-", which means "to worship, have recourse to, betake onself to" or "bhañj-," which means "to break."
The word also means "attachment, devotion to, fondness for, homage, faith or love, worship, piety to something as a spiritual, religious principle or means of salvation".
The meaning of the term "Bhakti" is analogous to but different from Kama.
Kama connotes emotional connection, sometimes with sensual devotion and erotic love.
Bhakti, in contrast, is spiritual, a love and devotion to religious concepts or principles, that engages both emotion and intellection.
Karen Pechelis states that the word Bhakti should not be understood as uncritical emotion, but as committed engagement.
She adds that, in the concept of "bhakti" in Hinduism, the engagement involves a simultaneous tension between emotion and intellection, "emotion to reaffirm the social context and temporal freedom, intellection to ground the experience in a thoughtful, conscious approach".
One who practices "bhakti" is called a "bhakta".
The term bhakti, in Vedic Sanskrit literature, has a general meaning of "mutual attachment, devotion, fondness for, devotion to" such as in human relationships, most often between beloved-lover, friend-friend, king-subject, parent-child.
It may refer to devotion towards a spiritual teacher (Guru) as "guru-bhakti", or to a personal God, or for spirituality without form (nirguna).
According to the Sri Lankan Buddhist scholar Sanath Nanayakkara, there is no single term in English that adequately translates or represents the concept of "bhakti" in Indian religions.
Terms such as "devotion, faith, devotional faith" represent certain aspects of "bhakti", but it means much more.
The concept includes a sense of deep affection, attachment, but not wish because "wish is selfish, affection is unselfish".
Some scholars, states Nanayakkara, associate it with "saddha" (Sanskrit: "Sraddha") which means "faith, trust or confidence".
However, "bhakti" can connote an end in itself, or a path to spiritual wisdom.
The term "Bhakti" refers to one of several alternate spiritual paths to moksha (spiritual freedom, liberation, salvation) in Hinduism, and it is referred to as "bhakti marga" or "bhakti yoga".
The other paths are "Jnana marga" (path of knowledge), "Karma marga" (path of works), "Rāja marga" (path of contemplation and meditation).
The term "bhakti" has been usually translated as "devotion" in Orientalist literature.
The colonial era authors variously described "Bhakti" as a form of mysticism or "primitive" religious devotion of lay people with monotheistic parallels.
However, modern scholars state "devotion" is a misleading and incomplete translation of "bhakti".
Many contemporary scholars have questioned this terminology, and most now trace the term "bhakti" as one of the several spiritual perspectives that emerged from reflections on the Vedic context and Hindu way of life.
Bhakti in Indian religions is not a ritualistic devotion to a God or to religion, but participation in a path that includes behavior, ethics, mores and spirituality.
It involves, among other things, refining one's state of mind, knowing God, participating in God, and internalizing God.
Increasingly, instead of "devotion", the term "participation" is appearing in scholarly literature as a gloss for the term "bhakti".
David Lorenzen states that "bhakti" is an important term in Sikhism and Hinduism.
They both share numerous concepts and core spiritual ideas, but "bhakti" of "nirguni" (devotion to divine without attributes) is particularly significant in Sikhism.
In Hinduism, diverse ideas continue, where both "saguni" and "nirguni" bhakti (devotion to divine with or without attributes) or alternate paths to spirituality are among the options left to the choice of a Hindu.
History.
The Upanishads.
The last of three epilogue verses of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad, dated to be from 1st millennium BCE, uses the word "Bhakti" as follows, 
This verse is one of the earliest use of the word "Bhakti" in ancient Indian literature, and has been translated as "the love of God".
Scholars have debated whether this phrase is authentic or later insertion into the Upanishad, and whether the terms "Bhakti" and "Deva" meant the same in this ancient text as they do in the modern era.
Max Muller states that the word "Bhakti" appears only once in this Upanishad, that too in one last verse of the epilogue, could have been a later addition and may not be theistic as the word was later used in much later "Sandilya Sutras".
Grierson as well as Carus note that the first epilogue verse 6.21 of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad is also notable for its use of the word "Deva Prasada" (देवप्रसाद, grace or gift of God), but add that "Deva" in the epilogue of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad refers to "pantheistic Brahman" and the closing credit to sage Shvetashvatara in verse 6.21 can mean "gift or grace of his Soul".
Post-Vedic movement.
Scholarly consensus sees "bhakti" as a post-Vedic movement that developed primarily during the Hindu Epics and Puranas era of Indian history (late first mill.
BCE-early first mill.
CE).
The "Bhagavad Gita" is the first text to explicitly use the word "bhakti" to designate a religious path, using it as a term for one of three possible religious approaches.
The Bhagavata Purana develops the idea more elaborately, while the Shvetashvatara Upanishad presents evidence of "guru-bhakti" (devotion to one's spiritual teacher).
Bhakti movement.
The "Bhakti Movement" was a rapid growth of bhakti, first starting in the later part of 1st millennium CE, from Tamil Nadu in southern India with the Shaiva Nayanars and the Vaishnava Alvars.
Their ideas and practices inspired bhakti poetry and devotion throughout India over the 12th-18th century CE.
The Alvars ("those immersed in God") were Vaishnava poet-saints who wandered from temple to temple, singing the praises of Vishnu.
They hailed the divine abodes of Vishnu and converted many people to Vaishnavism.
Like the Alvars, the Shaiva Nayanar poets were influential.
The "Tirumurai", a compilation of hymns by sixty-three Nayanar poets, is still of great importance in South India.
Hymns by three of the most prominent poets, Appar (7th century CE), Campantar (7th century) and Sundarar (9th century), were compiled into the "Tevaram", the first volumes of the "Tirumurai".
The poets' itinerant lifestyle helped create temple and pilgrimage sites and spread devotion to Shiva.
Early Tamil-Shiva bhakti poets quoted the Krishna Yajurveda.
The Alvars and Nayanars were instrumental in propagating the Bhakti tradition.
The Bhagavata Purana's references to the South Indian Alvar saints, along with its emphasis on "bhakti", have led many scholars to give it South Indian origins, though some scholars question whether this evidence excludes the possibility that "bhakti" movement had parallel developments in other parts of India.
Scholars state that the "bhakti" movement focused on the gods Vishnu, Shiva, Shakti and other deities, that developed and spread in India, was in response to the arrival of Islam in India about 8th century CE, and subsequent religious violence.
This view is contested by other scholars.
The Bhakti movement swept over east and north India from the fifteenth-century onwards, reaching its zenith between the 15th and 17th century CE.
Bhakti poetry and ideas influenced many aspects of Hindu culture, religious and secular, and became an integral part of Indian society.
It extended its influence to Sufism, Christianity, and Jainism.
Sikhism was founded by Nanak in the 15th century, during the bhakti movement period, and scholars call it a Bhakti sect of Indian traditions.
The movement has traditionally been considered as an influential social reformation in Hinduism, and provided an individual-focused alternative path to spirituality regardless of one's birth caste or gender.
Postmodern scholars question this traditional view and whether the Bhakti movement were ever a social reform or rebellion of any kind.
They suggest Bhakti movement was a revival, reworking and recontextualization of ancient Vedic traditions.
Types and classifications.
Bhakti Yoga.
The "Bhagavad Gita", variously dated to have been composed in 5th to 2nd century BCE, introduces bhakti yoga in combination with "karma yoga" and "jnana yoga", while the "Bhagavata Purana" expands on bhakti yoga, offering nine specific activities for the bhakti yogi.
Bhakti in the "Bhagavad Gita" offered an alternative to two dominant practices of religion at the time: the isolation of the sannyasin and the practice of religious ritual.
"Bhakti Yoga" is described by Swami Vivekananda as "the path of systematized devotion for the attainment of union with the Absolute".
In various chapters, including the twelfth chapter of the "Bhagavad Gita", Krishna describes "bhakti yoga" as one of the paths to the highest spiritual attainments.
In the sixth chapter, for example, the Gita states the following about bhakti yogi: 
Shandilya and Narada produced two important Bhakti texts, the "Shandilya Bhakti Sutra" and "Narada Bhakti Sutra".
They define devotion, emphasize its importance and superiority, and classify its forms.
According to Ramana Maharishi, states David Frawley, bhakti is a "surrender to the divine with one's heart".
It can be practiced as an adjunct to self-inquiry, and in one of four ways: 
Bhagavata Purana and Navaratnamalika.
The "Navaratnamalika" (garland of nine gems), nine forms of "bhakti" are listed: (1) "śravaṇa" (listening to ancient texts), (2) "kīrtana" (praying), (3) "smaraṇa" (remembering teachings in ancient texts), (4) "pāda-sevana" (service to the feet), (5) "archana" (worshiping), (6) "namaskar" or "vandana" (bowing to the divine), (7) "dāsya" (service to the divine), (8) "sākhyatva" (friendship with the divine), and (9) "ātma-nivedana" (self-surrender to the divine).
The Bhagavata Purana teaches nine similar facets of bhakti.
Bhavas.
Traditional Hinduism speaks of five different "bhāvas" or "affective essences".
In this sense, "bhāvas" are different attitudes that a devotee takes according to his individual temperament to express his devotion towards God in some form.
The different "bhāvas" are: 
Several saints are known to have practiced these "bhavas".
The nineteenth century mystic, Ramakrishna is said to have practiced these five "bhavas".
The attitude of Hanuman towards lord Rama is considered to be of "dasya bhava".
The attitude of Arjuna and the shepherd boys of Vrindavan towards Krishna is regarded as "sakhya bhava".
The attitude of Radha towards Krishna is regarded as "madhura bhava".
The attitude of Yashoda, who looked after Krishna during his childhood is regarded as "vatsalya bhava".
Caitanya-caritamrta mentions that Mahaprabhu came to distribute the four spiritual sentiments of Vraja loka: dasya, sakhya, vatsalya, and sringara.
Sringara is the relationship of the intimate love.
Related practices in other religions.
In olden days, saints such as Mirabai, Soordas, Narsinh Mehta composed several bhajans that were a path towards Bhakti for many, that are universally sung even today.
A modern age saint, Shri Devendra Ghia (Kaka) has composed about 10,000 hymns (a phenomenal task.)
These hymns are related to bhakti, knowledge, devotion, faith, introspection and honesty.
Devotionalism, similar to "Bhakti", states Michael Pasquier, has been a common form of religious activity in world religions throughout human history.
It is found in Christianity, Islam, Buddhism and Judaism.
Buddhism.
Bhakti (called "bhatti" in Pali language) has been a common aspect of Buddhism, where offerings and group prayers are made to images such the images of the Buddha and the "Bodhisattvas", or to deities such as wrathful deities.
Karel Werner notes that Bhakti has been a significant practice in Theravada Buddhism, and states, "there can be no doubt that deep devotion or "bhakti / bhatti" does exist in Buddhism and that it had its beginnings in the earliest days".
According to Sri Lankan scholar Indumathie Karunaratna, the meaning of "bhatti" changed throughout Buddhist history, however.
In early Buddhism, such as in the text Theragāthā, "bhatti" had the meaning of 'faithful adherence to the [Buddhist] religion', and was accompanied with knowledge.
In later text tradition, however, the term developed the meaning of an advanced form of emotional devotion.
Examples of the latter include the veneration of Buddha Amitabha and those in the "Saddharmapundrarika Sutra".
This changed the meaning of Buddhist devotion to a more person-centered sense, similar to a theist sense used in Hindu scriptures.
This sense of devotion was no longer connected with a belief in a religious system, and had little place for doubt, contradicting the early Buddhist concept of "saddhā".
"Saddhā" did not exclude reasonable doubt on the spiritual path, and was a step in reaching the final aim of developing wisdom, not an end in itself.
In early Buddhism, states Sanath Nanayakkara, the concept of taking refuge to the Buddha had the meaning of taking the Buddha as an ideal to live by, rather than the later sense of self-surrender.
But already in the Commentary to the Abhidhamma text "Puggalapaññatti", it is mentioned that the Buddhist devotee should develop his "saddhā" until it becomes "bhaddi", a sense not mentioned in earlier texts and probably influenced by the Hindu idea of "bhakti".
There are instances where commentator Buddhaghosa mentions taking refuge in the Buddha in the sense of mere adoration, indicating a historical shift in meaning.
Similar developments took place with regard to the term "puja" (honor) and the role of the Buddha image.
In Mahāyāna Buddhism, the doctrine of the trikāya (three bodies) and the devotion towards "Bodhisattvas" all indicating a shift of emphasis toward devotion as a central concept in later Buddhism.
In later faith-oriented literature, such as the Avadānas, faith is given an important role in Buddhist doctrine.
Nevertheless, faith ("śraddhā") is discussed in different contexts than devotion ("bhakti").
"Bhakti" is often used disparagingly to describe acts of worship to deities, often seen as ineffective and improper for a Buddhist.
Also, "bhakti" is clearly connected with a person as an object, whereas "śraddhā" is less connected with a person, and is more connected with truthfulness and truth.
Śraddhā focuses on ideas such as the working of karma and merit transfer.
Nevertheless, affective devotion is an important part of Buddhist practice, not only in Mahāyāna Buddhism.
According to Winston King, a scholar on Theravāda Buddhism in Myanmar, "warm, personalized, emotional" "bhakti" has been a part of the Burmese Buddhist tradition apart from the monastic and lay intellectuals.
The Buddha is treasured by the everyday devout Buddhists, just like Catholics treasure Jesus.
The orthodox teachers tend to restrain the devotion to the Buddha, but to the devout Buddhist populace, "a very deeply devotional quality" was and remains a part of the actual practice.
This is observable, states King, in "multitudes of Pagoda worshippers of the Buddha images" and the offerings they make before the image and nowhere else.
Another example is the worship of the "Bodhisattvas" and various deities in Tibetan and other traditions of Buddhism, including the so-called wrathful deities.
Jainism.
Bhakti has been a prevalent ancient practice in various Jaina sects, wherein learned Tirthankara ("Jina") and human "gurus" have been venerated with offerings, songs and Āratī prayers.
Jainism participated in the Bhakti school of medieval India, and has a rich tradition of bhakti literature ("stavan") though these have been less studied than those of the Hindu tradition.
The "Avasyaka sutra" of Jains includes, among ethical duties for the devotee, the recitation of "hymns of praise to the Tirthankaras" as the second Obligatory Action.
It explains this "bhakti" as one of the means to destroy negative karma.
According to Paul Dundas, such textual references to devotional activity suggests that "bhakti" was a necessary part of Jainism from an early period.
According to Jeffery D. Long, along with its strong focus on ethics and ascetic practices, the religiosity in Jainism has had a strong tradition of "bhakti" or devotion just like their Hindu counterparts.
The Jain community built ornate temples and prided in public devotion for its fordmakers, saints and teachers.
"Abhisekha", festival prayers, community recitals and "Murti puja" (rituals before an image) are examples of integrated bhakti in Jain practice.
Some Jain monks, however, reject Bhakti.
Vow of silence 
A vow of silence is a vow to maintain silence.
Although it is commonly associated with monasticism, no major monastic order takes a vow of silence.
Even the most fervently silent orders such as the Carthusians have time in their schedule for talking.
Recently, the vow of silence has been embraced by some in secular society as means of protest or of deepening their spirituality.
Silence is often seen as essential to deepening a relationship with God.
It is also considered a virtue in some religions.
In Western Christian traditions such as Catholicism and Lutheranism, the Great Silence is the period of time beginning at the canonical hour of Compline, in which votarists are silent until the first office of the next day, Lauds.
Examples.
Religious examples.
Despite the common misconception, no major Christian monasteries or religious orders take such a vow.
However, most monasteries have specific times (magnum silentium, work silence, times of prayer, etc.) and places (the chapel, the refectory, etc.) where speaking is prohibited unless absolutely necessary.
Even outside of these times and places, useless and idle words are forbidden.
In active orders, the members speak according to the needs of their various duties.
In the Indian religions, religious silence is called "Mauna" and the name for a sage "muni" (see, for example Sakyamuni) literally means "silent one".
In Buddhism, it is also explicitly stated that "one does not become a sage simply because of a vow of silence" due to the prescription for disciples to also teach the Buddhist doctrine.
The vow of silence is also relevant in the training of novices and is often cited as a way to resist the allures of "samsara", including those posed by the opposite sex.
Buddhist monks who take a vow of silence often carry an iron staff called "khakkhara", which makes a metallic noise to frighten away animals.
Since they cannot speak, the rattle of the staff also announces their arrival when they start begging for alms.
Mahatma Gandhi observed one day of silence a week, every Monday, and would not break this discipline for any reason.
Non-religious examples.
Additionally, a vow of silence can be made to express a bold statement.
This type may be to make a statement about issues such as child poverty.
An example of this is The November 30th Vow of Silence for Free The Children in which students in Canada take a 24-hour vow of silence to speak up against poverty and child labour.
In the United States, the Day of Silence is the GLSEN’s annual day of action to spread awareness about the effects of the bullying and harassment of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ) students.
Students take a day-long vow of silence to symbolically represent the silencing of LGBTQ students.
The Day of Silence has been held each year in April since 1996.
From 2011 to 2017, the Day of Silence was held on the second Friday in April except for April 11, 2014; in 2018 it was observed on Friday, April 27.
A more ancient example of a non-religious vow of silence is Pythagoras, who imposed a strict rule of silence on his disciples.
Canadian Christian Meditation Community 
The Canadian Christian Meditation Community (CCMC) is part of the World Community for Christian Meditation (WCCM), which was founded in 1991 to foster the teachings of Benedictine monk and priest, Fr. John Main, O.S.B. (1926–1982).
Fr.
Main taught a way of Christian meditation which he based on parallels he saw between the spiritual practice taught by Desert Father John Cassian and the meditative practice he had been taught by the Swami Satyanandain in Kuala Lumpur.
In 1977, Fr. John started a small Benedictine community in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, thus bringing this form of contemplative prayer to Canada.
The Canadian Community's national office is located in Montreal.
The current director of the WCCM is Fr. Laurence Freeman, O.S.B., O.C., a student of John Main and a Benedictine monk of the Olivetan Congregation.
On July 1, 2009, Michaëlle Jean, Governor General of Canada, announced the appointment of Fr. Freeman as an Officer of the Order of Canada.
The Community is a "monastery without walls", a family of national communities and emerging communities in over a hundred countries.
The foundation of the Community is the local meditation group, which meets weekly in homes, parishes, offices, hospitals, prisons, and colleges.
The World and Canadian Communities work closely with many Christian denominations and other faiths.
The Canadian Community sponsors retreats, schools for the training of teachers of meditation, lectures and other programs.
A national quarterly spiritual and news publication of the Canadian Community is mailed to members and also available online.
Information on current programs, connections to national coordinators and the location of meditation groups can be found on the Community website.
Medio Media is the communication and publishing arm of the World and Canadian Communities and offers a wide range of books, audio and videos to support the practice of meditation.
The online bookstore is at Medio Media.
Fr. Main taught the practice and discipline of Christian meditation as follows: 
Sit down.
Sit still and upright.
Close your eyes lightly.
Sit relaxed but alert.
Silently, interiorly begin to say a single word.
We recommend the prayer phrase maranatha.
Recite it as four syllables of equal length.
Ma-ra-na-tha.
Listen to it as you say it, gently but continuously.
Do not think or imagine anything - spiritual or otherwise.
If thoughts and images come, these are distractions at the time of meditation, so keep returning to simply saying the word.
Meditate each morning and evening for twenty to thirty minutes.
Techniques of Knowledge 
Knowledge is a term used by Shri Hans Ji Maharaj (Hans Rawat) to denote a formulation of four specific techniques that were imparted in a process of initiation.
The term continues to be used by two of Shri Hans Ji Maharaj's sons, Satpal Rawat and Prem Rawat.
Origins.
These techniques have some similarities to techniques in Sant Mat derived movements and may be derived from Surat Shabd Yoga.
Additionally, Kranenborg writes that the techniques of Knowledge originated from the Surat Shabda Yoga or Sant Mat, the Path of the Sound Current, and that some of the techniques are related to the 'japa-' or mantra-yoga which are similar to some techniques of Transcendental meditation and the Hare Krishnas.
The website "Maharaji.org" (1999) included the traceable story of "Masters" that, according to Prem Rawat, referred to the techniques of Knowledge since 1780, including Totapuri, Anandpuri Ji, Dayal Ji, Swarupanand Ji, and his father Hans Ji Maharaj.
Descriptions.
According to the Dutch religious scholar and Christian minister Reender Kranenborg and the American religious scholar J. Gordon Melton, these techniques are secret and were originally called "Light", "Sound", "Name" or "Word" and "Nectar" but Prem Rawat now refers to them as the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th techniques.
Prem Rawat asks practitioners to promise "not to reveal these techniques to anyone", but says to "let other people go through their own journey... [so] they, too, can have the techniques when they are ready."
Kranenborg and Melton provide differing details of them in their writings but agree on a general description of the practices, referring for some of those, to tantric practices or sabda-brahman meditation.
Another description including the details of the four techniques of knowledge is provided by Dr. Daniel Kriegman who describes the process for receiving Knowledge utilized by the Divine Light Mission in the early 1970s.
Michael Drury, describes these techniques as helping the practitioner to develop "a deep and spiritual self-knowledge."
Experience.
Jeffrey K. Hadden cites Prem Rawat in saying that "Knowledge is a way to be able to take all your senses that have been going outside all your life, turn them around and put them inside to feel and to actually experience you...
What you are looking for is inside of you."
Glen Whitaker, former national organizer of Elan Vital in the UK, said "That which we seek is already within us.
The process of reaching it is one of learning to experience what is already there.
It is one the individual needs to perform for him — or herself, with the guidance and help of the teacher".
According to George D. Chryssides, this Knowledge was based on self-understanding, providing the practitioner with calmness, peace, and contentment, as the inner-self is identical with the divine, and that Prem Rawat emphasizes that Knowledge is universal, not Indian, in nature.
According to Stephen J. Hunt "the major focus of Prem Rawat is on stillness, peace, and contentment within the individual, and his 'Knowledge' consists of the techniques to obtain them.
Knowledge, roughly translated, means the happiness of the true self-understanding.
Each individual should seek to comprehend his or her true self.
In turn, this brings a sense of well-being, joy, and harmony as one comes in contact with one's "own nature."
The process of reaching the true self within can only be achieved by the individual, but with the guidance and help of a teacher.
Hence, the movement seems to embrace aspects of world-rejection and world-affirmation.
The tens of thousands of followers in the West do not see themselves as members of a religion, but the adherents of a system of teachings that extol the goal of enjoying life to the full."
The experience of Knowledge is described by practitioners as internal and highly individual.
The techniques are to be practised privately, with no social structure or hierarchy related to their practice.
According to students, there is no liturgy or social obligation involved, but Prem Rawat instructs them to practise the techniques daily for at least one hour to fully benefit from them.
They also say that the techniques are universally applicable and their practice has no impact on or relationship to a student's gender, race, sexual orientation, economic status or national origin.
Elan Vital, the organization that succeeded the Divine Light Mission, also states that practice of Knowledge will not affect a person's religion.
Knowledge sessions.
In his early days in the West, Prem Rawat or his instructors (called Mahatmas in India) conducted these sessions face-to-face with small groups.
Wim Haan, a student of theology who belonged to a critical movement within the Roman Catholic Church, wrote that receiving Knowledge involved a formal initiation that the aspirant had to keep secret and that he believed that the reason for the secrecy was a direct connection between the techniques, the initiation and the need to live a life of devotion to Rawat.
Haan, who did not receive the techniques of Knowledge, also wrote that the fact that other groups may also use the same techniques would probably not help to increase the interest in them.
Haan wrote this article based on observations of the Dutch branch of the defunct DLM between 1980 and 1981.
Primordial qigong 
Primordial "qigong" is a form of "qigong" purportedly developed by the Taoist sage Chang San Feng.
Donald Rubbo, a lineage holder of the primordial "qigong" (from Master Zhu Hui) has written in "Primordial Qigong, A Gem from the Treasure Chest of Taoist Mystical Qigong", "The Primordial Qigong system reflects the wisdom of the ancient Taoist sages and their theory of the birth of the universe.
Primordial "qigong" is a three-dimensional physical mandala, and as such it encompasses all of the primary aspects of Taoist philosophy: the concepts of yin yang, the trinity (heaven, earth and man), the Five Element Wu Xing theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the I Ching, the Ba gua and the mystical aspects of numbers."
The Primordial "qigong" system reflects the Taoist theory of the birth of the universe.
These concepts were based on their observations of nature, their perception of the alternating balance of energy of the primal forces (yin yang) and the integral relationship between heaven, humanity and earth.
The Taoist sages postulated that from the pre-birth state of WuJi (Original Emptiness) came the primal spark and from the primal spark, Taiji (Supreme Ultimate) was born.
From Taiji, yin yang manifested as opposing forces.
Primordial "qigong" is also known as Tai Chi for Liberation (John P. Milton), Tai Chi for Enlightenment (Michael Winn) and Enlightenment Qigong (Andrew Fretwell).
The Ba gua is integrated into the primordial "qigong" form: the eight trigrams are represented by the placement of the body in the Center facing the cardinal directions and awareness of the intercardinal directions: northeast, southeast, northwest and southwest, as one turns both counter-clockwise and clockwise throughout the form.
Roger Jahnke has written in "The Healing Promise of Qi", quoting Dr. Chen: "The form called Primordial Qigong [Wuji Qigong] reverses time to reconnect the practitioner with the past and with their prebirth state to alter the course of the future.
I practiced this Qigong faithfully and took some herbal formulas and, over some time, completely recovered from cancer."
History.
Wuji (philosophy) Gung (primordial "qigong") is thought to have been developed by Zhang San Feng prior to his developing Tai Chi Chuan (Taijiquan).
Primordial "qigong" was brought to the United States by lineage holder Master Zhu Hui, who allegedly healed himself of hepatocirrhosis by practicing this form daily.
Master Zhu Hui was taught primordial "qigong" by Master Li Tong.
Donald Rubbo and Michael Winn both learned the form from Zhu Hui, as did Roger Jahnke.
John P. Milton is another notable teacher of primordial "qigong", who reports having learned the form at Wudang mountain in China.
Retreat (spiritual) 
The meaning of a spiritual retreat can be different for different religious communities.
Spiritual retreats are an integral part of many Hindu, Jewish, Buddhist, Christian and Sufi communities.
In Hinduism and Buddhism, meditative retreats are seen by some as an intimate way of deepening powers of concentration and insight.
Retreats are also popular in Christian churches, and were established in today's form by St. Ignatius of Loyola (14911556), in his Spiritual Exercises.
Ignatius was later to be made patron saint of spiritual retreats by Pope Pius XI in 1922.
Many Protestants, Catholics and Orthodox Christians partake in and organize spiritual retreats each year.
Meditative retreats are an important practice in Sufism, the mystical path of Islam.
The Sufi teacher Ibn Arabi's book "Journey to the Lord of Power (Risālat al-Anwār)" is a guide to the inner journey that was published over 700 years ago.
Buddhism.
A retreat can either be a time of solitude or a community experience.
Some retreats are held in silence, and on others there may be a great deal of conversation, depending on the understanding and accepted practices of the host facility and/or the participant(s).
Retreats are often conducted at rural or remote locations, either privately, or at a retreat centre such as a monastery.
Some retreats for advanced practitioners may be undertaken in darkness, a form of retreat that is common as an advanced Dzogchen practice in the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism.
Spiritual retreats allow time for reflection, prayer, or meditation.
They are considered essential in Buddhism, having been a common practice since the Vassa, or rainy season retreat, was established by the founder of Buddhism, Gautama Buddha.
In Zen Buddhism retreats are known as sesshin.
Christianity.
The Christian retreat can be defined most simply as a definite time (from a few hours in length to a month) spent away from one's normal life for the purpose of reconnecting, usually in prayer, with God.
Although the practice of leaving one's everyday life to connect on a deeper level with God, be that in the desert (as with the Desert Fathers), or in a monastery, is nearly as old as Christianity itself, the practice of spending a specific time away with God is a more modern phenomenon, dating from the 1520s and St. Ignatius of Loyola's composition of the Spiritual Exercises.
The fasting of Jesus in the desert for forty days is used as a biblical justification of retreats.
The retreat was popularised in Roman Catholicism by the Society of Jesus (Jesuits), whose founder, St. Ignatius of Loyola, as a layman began, in the 1520s, directing others in making (participating in) the exercises.
Another form the Exercises came in, which became known as the nineteenth "Observation", 'allowed continuing one's ordinary occupations with the proviso of setting aside a few hours a day for this special purpose.'
The spiritual exercises were intended for people wanting to live closer to God's will for their life.
In the 17th century, retreats became much more widespread in the Catholic Church.
Retreats were not originally seen as suitable for women, but in 1674 Catherine de Francheville (), supported by the Breton Jesuit Vincent Huby (), founded a retreat house for women in Vannes.
This developed into a community of laywomen, who also founded a daughter house in Quimper, but were dispersed by the French Revolution.
Some however came together to found schools, and additional communities were established in England, and later in Ireland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy.
These developed in the course of the 19th century, under the name of "La Retraite" (), into a religious Congregation of nuns.
The active involvement of the sisters in retreats was curtailed later in the 19th century, but blossomed again after the Second Vatican Council, involving among other activity an extension of the community into Chile, South Africa, Cameroon and Mali.
Spiritual retreats were introduced to the Church of England by priests of the Anglo-Catholic Society of the Holy Cross in 1856, first for clergy, and then also for laity.
These retreats lasted five days.
The Society of the Holy Cross's first retreats were held in secrecy.
The practice was spread by Anglo-Catholic priests such as Francis Henry Murray, Alexander Forbes, and Thomas Thellusson Carter.
The Oxford Movement further spread the practice of retreats to many devout men and women, borrowing upon Catholic practices.
Their retreats were typically 3–4 days, and featured much silence and prayer.
At the end of the 19th century, and in the first years of the 20th century, retreats began to spread among the working classes and beyond those of notable devotion.
These retreats were less ascetic in character, and included more conversation and leisure.
They typically lasted 1–3 days.
Spiritual retreats may have various themes that reinforce Christian values, principles, and scriptural understanding.
They may be individual or involve a group.
Retreats for Christian youth groups are common, as are getaways for Sunday School classes, men's and women's Bible study groups, and Christian school field trips.
Common locations for Christian retreats include churches and retreat centers.
Retreat centers typically offer overnight accommodations (such as in a cabin or dormitory), meals, activities, meeting rooms, and chapel space.
Following the growth of the Cursillo movement in Spain in the 20th century, similar retreats have become popular, either using licensed Cursillo material or independent material loosely based on its concepts, leading to the development of the three day movement.
Sufi retreats or spiritual khalwa.
The translation of "khālwa" (from Arabic الخلوة) is seclusion or separation, but it has a different connotation in Sufi terminology in which it refers to the act of self-abandonment in desire for the Divine Presence.
In complete seclusion, the Sufi continuously repeats the name of God as a highest form of remembrance of God meditation.
In his book, Journey to the Lord of Power, Muhiyid-Did ibn Arabi (1165-1240 A.D.) discussed the stages through which the Sufi passes in his khalwa.
Ibn Arabi suggested: "The Sufi should shut his door against the world for forty days and occupy himself with remembrance of Allah, that is to keep repeating, "Allah, Allah..."
Then, "Almighty God will spread before him the degrees of the kingdom as a test.
First, He will discover the secrets of the mineral world.
If he occupies himself with dthikr, He (God) will unveil to the secrets of the vegetable world, then the secrets of the animal world, then the infusion of the world of life-force into lives, then the "surface sign" (the light of the Divine Names, according to Abdul-Karim al-Jeeli, the book's translator), then the degrees of speculative sciences, then the world of formation and adornment and beauty, then the degrees of the qutb (the soul or pivot of the universe-see #16) Then he will be given the divine wisdom and the power of symbols and authority over the veil and the unveiling.
The degree of the Divine Presence is made clear to him, the garden (of Eden) and Hell are revealed to him, then the original forms of the son of Adam, the Throne of Mercy.
If it is appropriate, he will know his destination.
Then he will reveal to him the Pen, the First Intellect (as it is called by Sufi philosophers), then the Mover of the Pen, the right hand of the Truth.
(The "Truth" as defined by al-Jeeli is that by which everything is created, none other than God most High.)
The practice of khalwah is regularly followed by the Sufis, with the permission and the supervision of a Sufi authority.
The Sufis base the assigning of forty days of khalwa period on the forty days Allah had appointed for Musa (Moses) as a fasting period before speaking to him, as mentioned in different chapters in the Qur'an.
One of them is from surat al-Baqarah.
Khalwa is still practiced today amongst authorized Sheikhs, such as Mawlana Sheikh Nazim Al-Haqqani, Lefka, Cyprus.
Meditation.
Meditation courses or retreats, either in a group or solo, are a common part of many meditation traditions.
Yoga.
In modern Yoga a retreat is often a recreational holiday, where everyday business is left for a few days (weekend-retreat) up to weeks.
The goal is to let go of daily stress and problems by doing Asanas rather than pure meditation.
Christian meditation 
Christian meditation is a form of prayer in which a structured attempt is made to become aware of and reflect upon the revelations of God.
The word meditation comes from the Latin word "meditārī", which has a range of meanings including to reflect on, to study, and to practice.
Christian meditation is the process of deliberately focusing on specific thoughts (such as a Bible passage) and reflecting on their meaning in the context of the love of God.
Christian meditation aims to heighten the personal relationship based on the love of God that marks Christian communion.
Both in Eastern and Western Christianity meditation is the middle level in a broad three-stage characterization of prayer: it involves more reflection than first level vocal prayer, but is more structured than the multiple layers of contemplative prayer.
Teachings in both the Eastern and Western Christian churches have emphasized the use of Christian meditation as an element in increasing one's knowledge of Christ.
Context and structure.
Christian meditation involves looking back on Jesus' life, thanksgiving and adoration of God for his action in sending Jesus for human salvation.
In her book "The Interior Castle" (Mansions 6, Chapter 7) Saint Teresa of Avila defined Christian meditation as follows: 
By meditation I mean prolonged reasoning with the understanding, in this way.
We begin by thinking of the favor which God bestowed upon us by giving us His only Son; and we do not stop there but proceed to consider the mysteries of His whole glorious life.
Quoting the Gospel of Matthew: "No one knows the Father but only the Son and anyone whom the Son wants to reveal him" and I Corinthians: "But we have received the Spirit who is from God so that we may realize what God has freely given us", theologian Hans von Balthasar explained the context of Christian meditation as follows: 
The dimensions of Christian meditation develop from God's having completed his self-revelation in two directions: Speaking out of his own, and speaking as a man, through his Son, disclosing the depths of man...
And this meditation can take place only where the revealing man, God's Son, Jesus Christ, reveals God as his Father: in the Holy Spirit of God, so we may join in probing God's depths, which only God's Spirit probes.
Building on that theme, E. P. Clowney explained that three dimensions of Christian meditation are crucial, not merely for showing its distinctiveness, but for guiding its practice.
The first is that Christian meditation is grounded in the Bible.
Because the God of the Bible is a personal God who speaks in words of revelation, Christian meditation responds to this revelation and focuses on that aspect, in contrast to mystic meditations which use mantras.
The second distinctive mark of Christian meditation is that it responds to the "love of" God, as in I John : "We love, for he first loved us".
The personal relationship based on the love of God that marks Christian communion is thus heightened in Christian meditation.
The third dimension is that the revelations of the Bible and the love of God lead to the worship of God: making Christian meditation an exercise in "praise".
Thomas Merton characterized the goal of Christian meditation as follows: "The true end of Christian meditation is practically the same as the end of liturgical prayer and the reception of the sacraments: a deeper union by grace and charity with the Incarnate Word, who is the only Mediator between God and man, Jesus Christ."
While Protestants view salvation in terms of "faith and grace alone" (i.e. sola fide and sola gratia) both Western and Eastern Catholic Christians see a role for meditation on the path to salvation and redemption.
Apostle Paul stated in Epistle to the Romans that salvation only comes from "God that hath mercy".
The path to salvation in Christian meditation is not one of give and take, and the aim of meditation is to bring joy to the heart of God.
The Word of God directs meditations to show the two aspects of love that please God: obedience and adoration.
The initiative in Christian salvation is with God, and one does not meditate or love God to gain his favor.
Role of the Holy Spirit.
In Western Christian teachings, meditation is usually believed to involve the inherent action of the Holy Spirit to help the meditating Christian understand the deeper meanings of the Word of God.
In the 12th century, decades before Guigo II's the "Ladder of the Monk", one of his predecessors, Guigo I, emphasized this belief by stating that when earnest meditation begins, the Holy Spirit enters the soul of the meditator, "turns water into wine" and shows the path towards contemplation and a better understanding of God.
In the 19th century, Charles Spurgeon affirmed this belief within the Protestant tradition and wrote: "The Spirit has taught us in meditation to ponder its message, to put aside, if we will, the responsibility of preparing the message we've got to give.
Just trust God for that."
In the 20th century, Hans Urs von Balthasar paraphrased this teaching as follows: 
The vistas of God's Word unfold to the meditating Christian solely through the gift of the Divine Spirit.
How could we understand what is within God and is disclosed to us except through the Spirit of God who is communicated to us?
As a biblical basis for this teaching, von Balthasar referred to : "these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit.
The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God".:
Distinction from non-Christian meditation.
Christian meditation is generally held to be distinct from the styles of meditations performed in Eastern religions (such as Buddhism) or in the context of the New Age.
While other types of meditation may suggest approaches to disengage the mind, Christian meditation aims to fill the mind with thoughts related to biblical passages or Christian devotions.
Although some mystics in both the Western and Eastern churches have associated feelings of ecstasy with meditation (e.g. St. Teresa of Avila's legendary meditative ecstasy), St. Gregory of Sinai, one of the originators of Hesychasm, stated that the goal of Christian meditation is "seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit, beyond the minor phenomenon of ecstasy".
Modern Christian teachings on meditation at times include specific criticism of the transcendental styles of meditation, e.g. John Bertram Phillips stated that Christian meditation involves the action of the Holy Spirit on biblical passages and warned of approaches that "disengage the mind" from scripture.
According to Edmund P. Clowney, Christian meditation contrasts with cosmic styles of oriental meditation as radically as the portrayal of God the Father in the Bible contrasts with discussions of Krishna or Brahman in Indian teachings.
Unlike eastern meditations, most styles of Christian meditations are intended to stimulate thought and deepen meaning.
Christian meditation aims to heighten the personal relationship based on the love of God that marks Christian communion.
According to Clowney it is the search for wisdom, not ecstasy, that marks the path of Christian meditation, a wisdom sought in the "Christ of Scripture and the Scripture of Christ".
A 1989 document generally known as "Aspects of Christian meditation" set forth the position of the Holy See with respect to the differences between Christian and eastern styles of meditation.
The document, issued as a letter to all Catholic bishops, stresses the differences between Christian and eastern meditative approaches.
It warns of the dangers of attempting to mix Christian meditation with eastern approaches since that could be both confusing and misleading, and may result in the loss of the essential Christocentric nature of Christian meditation.
The letter warned that euphoric states obtained through Eastern meditation should not be confused with prayer or assumed to be signs of the presence of God, a state that should always result in loving service to others.
Without these truths, the letter said, meditation, which should be a "flight from the self", can degenerate into a form of self-absorption.
Some authors, however, have emphasized similarities between Christian meditation and non-Christian meditation.
Psychologist Daniel Goleman gives an overview of many styles of meditation in "The Varieties of the Meditative Experience", and includes a section on what he believes are key commonalities (as well as differences); he argues that all share the goal of the cultivation of attention.
Thomas Merton, an American Catholic monk, believed Christianity had forsaken its mystical tradition in favor of Cartesian emphasis on rationality and concepts.
Eastern traditions, for Merton, were mostly untainted by this type of thinking and thus had much to offer in terms of how to think of and understand oneself.
Having studied the Desert Fathers and other Christian mystics, Merton found many parallels between the language of these Christian mystics and the language of Zen philosophy.
This said, Merton felt non-Christian religions had little or nothing to contribute in terms of doctrine.
Comparison to non-Christian meditation.
Meditation and prayer can mean different things depending on the religion, sect, school, or individual.
Some even believe that meditation and prayer can mean the same thing.
Scholar, Rita Gross notes in her article “Meditation and Prayer: A Comparative Inquiry”, that there is an incorrect stereotype that Buddhist meditation is only a quiet and solitary practice, when in reality many Tibetan Buddhist use the word 'prayer' quite frequently as they even direct their prayers to being separate from themselves.
Gross discusses the similarities in the way Christian prayers are also used as petitions, pleading for some sort of action or emotion from God.
The discussion of prayer and meditation can be an intimate and sacred topic, as Gross has portrayed it here.
Another article regarding the comparison of Buddhist and Christian prayer is Robert Aitken's “Formal Practice: Buddhist or Christian.”
Aitken details seven different Buddhist practices and describes how they might connect with Christian practices.
To name just a couple, the "sange", is nearly the same practice as Christian confession, both involve a daily expression of wrong doings, with the intention of realizing the good (being the Dharma and God for Buddhism and Christianity, respectively).
Another Buddhist practice described to support Aitken’s argument is the "Nembutsu", a chant, or prayer, meant to elicit an influential super-being in Buddhism, "Amida".
No doubt there is a comparison that Aitken draws here between Christian prayer to God and the Buddhist "Nembutsu".
Additionally, Kyeongil Jung writes of his own personal journey to find peace, or liberation from suffering, as he is consistent and engaged in both Christianity and Buddhism.
Jung paints this complex scene in which it is possible to find liberation through these two religious paths, yet there are also four main dichotomies that he presents which he has climbed over in his own spiritual walk.
The last one is of relevance to this section on meditation.
Jung presents a more abstract case of a congenial plight on mindfulness; mediation and action, finding that there isn’t one that comes without the other first.
He asserts that “morality [social practice/action] and meditation strengthen and cultivate each other.”
He presents two anecdotes to demonstrate that mindfulness and movement are both synonymous and cyclical in practice.
Old Testament references.
In the Old Testament, there are two Hebrew words for meditation: "hāgâ" (), which means "to sigh" or "murmur", but also "to meditate", and "sîḥâ" (), which means "to muse", or "rehearse in one's mind".
When the Hebrew Bible was translated into Greek, "hāgâ" became the Greek "melete" which emphasized meditation's movement in the depth of the human heart.
"Melete" was a reminder that one should never let meditation be a formality.
The Latin Bible then translated "hāgâ"/"melete" into "meditatio".
The Bible mentions "meditate" or "meditation" 23 times, 19 times in the Book of Psalms alone.
When the Bible mentions meditation, it often mentions obedience in the next breath.
An example is the Book of Joshua: "This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it.
For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.."
History.
During the Middle Ages, the monastic traditions of both Western and Eastern Christianity moved beyond vocal prayer to Christian meditation.
These progressions resulted in two distinct and different meditative practices: Lectio Divina in the West and hesychasm in the East.
Hesychasm involves the repetition of the Jesus Prayer, but Lectio Divina uses different Scripture passages at different times and although a passage may be repeated a few times, Lectio Divina is not repetitive in nature.
The progression from Bible reading, to meditation, to loving regard for God, was first formally described by Guigo II, a Carthusian monk who died late in the 12th century.
Guigo II's book "The Ladder of Monks" is considered the first description of methodical prayer in the western mystical tradition.
In Eastern Christianity, the monastic traditions of "constant prayer" that traced back to the Desert Fathers and Evagrius Pontikos established the practice of hesychasm and influenced John Climacus' book "The Ladder of Divine Ascent" by the 7th century.
These meditative prayers were promoted and supported by Saint Gregory Palamas in the 14th century.
The methods of "methodical prayer" as taught by the "Devotio Moderna" group in northern Europe had entered Spain and were known in the early 16th century.
The book "The Imitation of Christ" which was known in Spain as "Contemptus mundi" became known in Spain, and while Teresa probably did not initially know of Guigo II's methods she was likely influenced by its teachings via the works of Francisco de Osuna which she studied.
Teresa's contemporary and collaborator, John of the Cross continued the tradition of Guigo II and taught the four stages of Lectio Divina.
By the 19th century the importance of biblical meditation had also been firmly established in the Protestant spiritual tradition.
During the 18th and early 19th centuries, some components of meditation had started to be de-emphasized in some branches of Western Christianity.
However, the early part of the 20th century witnessed a revival and books and articles on approaches such as Lectio Divina aimed at the general public began to appear by the middle of the century.
In 1965, one of the principal documents of the Second Vatican Council, the dogmatic constitution "Dei verbum" (Latin for "Word of God"), emphasized the use of Lectio Divina and on the 40th anniversary of "Dei verbum" in 2005 Pope Benedict XVI reaffirmed its importance.
Approaches to meditation.
A number of saints and historical figures have followed and presented specific approaches to Christian meditation.
Both Eastern and Western Christian teachings have emphasized the use of meditation as an element in increasing one's knowledge of Christ.
The "Spiritual Exercises" of Ignatius of Loyola use meditative mental imagery, with the goal of knowing Christ more intimately and loving him more ardently.
In "The Way of Perfection", St. Theresa of Avila taught her nuns how to try to get to know Christ by using meditation and mental prayer.
Hesychastic prayer and meditation continues to be used in the Eastern Orthodox tradition as a spiritual practice that facilitates the knowing of Christ.
St. Ignatius of Loyola.
The "Spiritual Exercises" of St. Ignatius of Loyola (1491–1556), the founder of the Jesuits, contain numerous meditative exercises.
To this day, the "Spiritual Exercises" remain an integral part of the Novitiate training period of the Roman Catholic religious order of Jesuits.
The exercises are intended as notes to guide a spiritual director who is leading someone else through an experience of Christian meditation.
The entire experience takes about 30 days and often involves a daily interview with the director.
The process begins with a consideration of the purpose of one's life and the relationship with the rest of creation.
It is followed by a week of meditation about sin and its consequences.
Next comes a period of meditating on the events of the life of Jesus, and another for thinking about his suffering and death.
The final week is to experience the joy of the resurrection, and in conclusion to reflect on God's love and the response of love for God.
The exercises often involve imagery in which one enters a biblical scene.
For example, the practitioner is encouraged to visualize and meditate upon scenes from the life of Christ, at times asking questions from Christ on the cross, during crucifixion.
St. Teresa of Avila.
St. Teresa of Ávila (1515–1582) a Doctor of the Church, practiced contemplative prayer for periods of one hour at a time, twice a day. St. Teresa believed that no one who was faithful to the practice of meditation could possibly lose his soul.
Her writings are viewed as fundamental teachings in Christian spirituality.
St. Teresa taught her nuns to meditate on specific prayers.
Her prayers described in 
"The Way of Perfection" involve meditation on a mystery in the life of Jesus and are based on the faith that "God is within", a truth that Teresa said she learned from St. Augustine.
In her "Life", she wrote that she taught herself from the instructions given in the book, "The Third Spiritual Alphabet" – by Francisco de Osuna – which relates to Franciscan mysticism.
Her starting point was the practice of "recollection", i.e. keeping the senses and the intellect in check and not allowing them to stray.
In her meditations, one generally restricts attention to a single subject, principally the love of God.
In "The Way of Perfection" she wrote: "It is called recollection because the soul collects together all the faculties and enters within itself to be with God".
She would use devices such as short readings, a scene of natural beauty or a religious statue or picture to remind her to keep her focus.
She wrote that in due course, the mind naturally learns to maintain focus on God almost effortlessly.
St. Theresa viewed Christian meditation as the first of four steps in achieving "union with God", and used the analogy of watering the garden.
She compared basic meditation to watering a garden with a bucket, "Recollection" to the water wheel, "Quiet" (contemplation) to a spring of water and "Union" to drenching rain.
Early studies on states of consciousness by Roland Fischer found evidence of mystical experience in the writings of Saint Teresa of Avila.
In her autobiography she writes that, at the peak of a praying experience "... the soul neither hears nor sees nor feels.
While it lasts, none of the senses perceives or knows what is taking place".
This corresponds to the fourth stage described by Saint Teresa, "Devotion of Ecstasy", where the consciousness of being in the body disappears, as an effect of deep transcendent meditation in prayer.
Saint Francis de Sales.
Saint Francis de Sales (1576–1622) used a four-part approach to Christian meditation based on ""preparation", "consideration", "affections and resolutions" and "conclusions"": 
Other approaches.
John Main OSB (1926–1982) was a Benedictine monk and priest who presented a way of Christian meditation which used a prayer-phrase or mantra.
This approach was then used by groups which then become the World Community for Christian Meditation.
By denomination.
Catholic Church.
Saint Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) said that meditation is necessary for devotion, and the Second Vatican Council called for "faithful meditation on God's word" as part of the spiritual formation of seminarians.
Saint John of the Cross (1542–1591), a close friend of St. Teresa of Avila, viewed Christian meditation as a necessary step toward union with God, and wrote that even the most spiritually advanced persons always needed to regularly return to meditation.
The Catechism of the Catholic Church encourages meditation as a form of prayer: "Meditation is above all a quest.
The mind seeks to understand the why and how of the Christian life, in order to adhere and respond to what the Lord is asking" (Catechism section # 2705) and that Christians owe it to themselves to develop the desire to meditate regularly (# 2707).
Emphasizing "union with God", it states: "Meditation engages thought, imagination, emotion, and desire.
This mobilization of faculties is necessary in order to deepen our convictions of faith, prompt the conversion of our heart, and strengthen our will to follow Christ.
Christian prayer tries above all to meditate on the mysteries of Christ, as in lectio divina or the rosary.
This form of prayerful reflection is of great value, but Christian prayer should go further: to the knowledge of the love of the Lord Jesus, to union with him" (#2708).
Meditative prayer is different from contemplative prayer (See CCC 2709-2724).
Pope Francis said that meditation is a need for everyone.
He noted that the term "meditation" has had many meanings throughout history, and that "the ancients used to say that the organ of prayer is the heart."
Pope Francis stated that "The prayer of the Christian is first of all an encounter with the Other, with a capital "O": the transcendent encounter with God...That is, meditating means going – guided by a phrase from the Scripture, from a word – to the encounter with Jesus within us...And in this way, only in this way, can we find ourselves.”
Eucharistic meditation.
Christian meditation performed with Eucharistic adoration outside the context of the Mass has inspired extensive Catholic writing and inspirational literature, especially since the 18th century.
The "Eucharistic meditations" of Saints Pierre Julien Eymard and Jean Vianney (both promoters of the Eucharist) were published as books.
Saint Thérèse of Lisieux was devoted to Eucharistic meditation and on February 26, 1895, shortly before she died, wrote from memory and without a rough draft her poetic masterpiece ""To Live by Love"," which she had composed during Eucharistic meditation.
Significant portions of the writings of the Venerable Concepcion Cabrera de Armida were reported to have been based on her adoration of the Blessed Sacrament.
Similarly, in her book "Eucharist: True Jewel of Eucharistic Spirituality", Maria Candida of the Eucharist (who was beatified by Pope John Paul II) wrote about her own personal experiences and reflections on Eucharistic meditation.
Rosary meditations.
Meditation is an integral part of the rosary.
This mode of meditation is the process of reflecting on the mysteries of the rosary.
With practice, this may in time turn into contemplation on the mysteries.
The practice of meditation during the praying of repeated Hail Marys dates back to 15th century Carthusian monks, and was soon adopted by the Dominicans at large.
By the 16th century the practice of meditation during the rosary had spread across Europe, and the book "Meditationi del Rosario della Gloriosa Maria Virgine" (i.e. Meditations on the Rosary of the Glorious Virgin Mary) printed in 1569 for the rosary confraternity of Milan provided an individual meditation to accompany each bead or prayer.
Saint Teresa of Avila's meditative approach of focusing on "the favor which God bestowed upon us by giving us His only Son" can be viewed as the basis of most scriptural rosary meditations.
In his 2002 encyclical "Rosarium Virginis Mariae", Pope John Paul II placed the rosary at the very center of Christian spirituality.
Emphasizing that the final goal of Christian life is to be transformed, or "transfigured", into Christ he stated that the rosary helps believers come closer to Christ by contemplating Christ.
He stated that the rosary unites us with Mary's own prayer, who, in the presence of God, prays with us and for us. and stated that: "To recite the rosary is nothing other than to contemplate with Mary the face of Christ."
Eastern Christianity.
During the Byzantine Empire, between the 10th and 14th centuries, a tradition of prayer called hesychasm developed, particularly on Mount Athos in Greece, and continues to the present.
St.
Gregory of Sinai is considered by most to be the founder of the hesychastic approach to prayer.
This tradition uses a special posture and breathing rituals, accompanied by the repetition of a short prayer (traditionally the Jesus Prayer) giving rise to suggestions that it may have been influenced by Indian approaches.
"While some might compare it ["hesychastic prayer"] with a mantra, to use the Jesus Prayer in such a fashion is to violate its purpose.
One is never to treat it as a string of syllables for which the 'surface' meaning is secondary.
Likewise, hollow repetition is considered to be worthless (or even spiritually damaging) in the hesychast tradition."
Rather, it is to be in the spirit of a true mantra.
This style of prayer was at first opposed as heretical by Barlam in Calabria, but was defended by Saint Gregory Palamas.
Coming from "hesychia" ("stillness, rest, quiet, silence"), hesychasm continues to be practiced in the Eastern Orthodox Church and some other Eastern Churches of the Byzantine Rite.
Hesychasm has not gained significance in neither the Western Christian Churches nor the Oriental Christian Churches.
In hesychasm, the Jesus prayer, consisting of the phrase: "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me" is repeated either for a set period of time or a set number of times.
Hesychasm is contrasted with the more mental or imaginative forms of Christian meditation in which a person is encouraged to imagine or think of events from the life of Jesus or sayings from the Gospel.
Sometimes hesychasm has been compared to the meditative techniques of oriental religions and it is possible that there were interactions between Hesychasts and Sufis, but this has not been proven.
Movement Medicine 
Movement Medicine is a movement meditation practice, intended to create an experiential and embodied connectedness with the world.
It was developed by Susannah and Ya'Acov Darling Khan, who directed the Moving Centre School Europe, representing Gabrielle Roth and the 5Rhythms in Europe until 2007.
Movement Medicine integrates physical, artistic, spiritual, shamanic and therapeutic practices so as to stimulate human creativity, healing and transformation, focussing on the relationship with ourselves, each other, the earth, and the spirit of life.
It is non-denominational, aiming to answer the spiritual impulse without the need for dogma or belief.
The Movement Medicine practice is meant to give people tools to integrate the freedom and aliveness of the dance into daily life.
Besides 5Rhythms, Movement Medicine is influenced by shamanism, Helen Poynor's "Walk of Life" movement work, and global environmental initiatives such as the "Awakening the Dreamer" Symposium.
Although not a social movement in the traditional sense of the word, the practice shows similarities with the Human Potential Movement and the New Age movement, sharing interest in a search for self actualization, empowerment and spiritual transformation.
There is a professional organization of Movement Medicine Teachers and Facilitators, and a Registered Charity which sponsors dancers from different countries to train to teach the practice.
Movement Medicine teacher training is recognised by the International Conscious Movement Teachers Association (ICMTA), and graduates and teachers in training are eligible for membership in ICMTA.
Maps of Movement Medicine.
Movement Medicine works with 4 different 'maps', which focus on different aspects of life in general and the dance practice in particular.
Each map is accompanied by different tools, exercises and practices.
Firstly, the map of the 4 Aristotelian elements, Earth, Fire, Water and Air is foundational to Movement Medicine.
According to Ya'Acov and Susannah Darling Khan, these elements provide an opportunity to explore different movement qualities, and provide a language of metaphor to support the practice.
Each element is considered to exist both inside and outside the dancer, who connects to them through movement and imagination.
Secondly, "the 5 dimensions of awareness" concern different dimensions of moving between micro and macro, individual, inter-personal and global.
These are called "the 5 dimensions of awareness": Self, Relational, Environmental, Ancestral and Divine.
The practice supports movement across each of these.
According to Ya'Acov Darling Khan, trance is like "discovering that you've got second, third, fourth, and fifth gears of perception when you've been ambling along in first."
The third map, called "the 9 Gateways" provides an orientation in space and time and reflects the following 9 aspects of life, divided into groups of three, called "Journeys": 1 Body, 2 Heart, 3 Mind, 4 Past, 5 Present, 6 Future, 7 Fulfilment 8 Interconnection, 9 Realisation.
The 1st "Journey" covers the first three gateways; Body, Heart and Mind.
In Movement Medicine, this is represented as a vertical axis from the feet, through the head upwards, and back down again.
The 2nd "Journey" explores the 4th, 5th, and 6th gateways, which are Past, Present and Future, which are said to form an axis through time, with the 'present' represented "in" the body, connected horizontally to the past (behind) and future (in front).
The "3rd Journey", which is visualised as a horizontal connection from side to side, aims to manifest individual qualities, a sense of connection with the culture or community around, and a sense of the realisation of the mystical experience of 'one-ness.'
Finally, the last map reflects the dynamic relationship between yin and yang at the centre and the tree of life which is found in many cultures worldwide.
In the tree sits the phoenix, which, as symbol for the power of transformation, seems to reflect the essence of Movement Medicine.
Research.
A PhD research describes that Movement Medicine dancers experience fundamental shifts in their personal growth and wellbeing in areas of the body, emotions, mind and spirituality.
Participants describe insights regarding personal beliefs and patterns, their relationship to ancestral and family history, and to cultural patterns and mechanisms.
Furthermore, participants sometimes experience new awareness regarding the nature of life, oneness, and various other ‘life lessons’.
Although the variety of different traditions that inform the practice has been criticized, the mixture of different techniques are united in a coherent structure, which offers people from many different backgrounds useful entry points.
A second PhD research project is still being carried out at Exeter University, which looks at the transformational aspects of Movement Medicine through the lens of leadership studies.
Kayotsarga 
Kayotsarga ( , ) is a yogic posture which is an important part of the Jain meditation.
It literally means "dismissing the body".
A tirthankara is represented either seated in yoga posture or standing in the kayotsarga posture.
"Kayotsarga" means "to give up one's physical comfort and body movements", thus staying steady, either in a standing or other posture, and concentrating upon the true nature of the soul.
It is one of the six essentials ("avasyaka") of a Jain ascetic and one of the 28 primary attributes of a Digambara monk 
Twenty-one of the tīrthankaras of Jainism are said to have attained "moksha" in the kayotsarga “standing meditation” posture.
An example of unflinching standing meditation is that of "Arihant Bahubali" who is said to have stood in kayotsarga for a year.
Sāmayika.
In performing "sāmayika" (daily meditation), the "śrāvaka" has to stand facing north or east and bow to the "Pancha-Parameṣṭhi".
He then sit down and recites the Namokara mantra a certain number of times, and finally devotes himself to holy meditation.
This consists of: 
Sama (Sufism) 
Sama (, Persian, Urdu and - "samā‘un") is a Sufi ceremony performed as part of the meditation and prayer practice dhikr.
Sama means "listening", while dhikr means "remembrance".
These performances often include singing, playing instruments, dancing, recitation of poetry and prayers, wearing symbolic attire, and other rituals.
Sama is a particularly popular form of worship in Sufism.
In 2008, UNESCO confirmed the "Mevlevi Sama Ceremony" of Turkey as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.
Etymology.
The term sama stems from the root-verb meaning "acceptance by tradition", from which are derived the words سَمْع ("sam‘un") and اِسْتِمَاع ("’istimā‘un", listening), often paired with نَقْل ("naqlun") and تَقْلِيد ("taqlīdun", tradition).
It may have been in use since the tenth century to refer to a type of dhikr (remembrance of God), a ceremony used by various Sufi orders, particularly the Chishti order of the sub-continent.
It often involves prayer, song and dance.
An alternative etymology for Sema maybe the Greek σῆμα - sêma, which means tomb, significant or signal (ex. Semantics, Polysemy e.t.c.).
Origin.
The origination of Sama in the Mevlevi Order of Sufis is credited to Rumi, Sufi master and creator of the Mevlevis.
The story of the creation of this unique form of dhikr is that Rumi was walking through the town marketplace one day when he heard the rhythmic hammering of the goldbeaters.
It is believed that Rumi heard the dhikr, "la ilaha ilallah" or in English, "There is no god but Allah" in the apprentices beating of the gold and was so entranced in happiness he stretched out both of his arms and started spinning in a circle (sufi whirling).
With that the practice of Sama and the dervishes of the Mevlevi order were born.
Similarly, Abu Sa`id, (357 A.H.) (967 C.E.) was born in Mayhana, a town near Sarakhs, in Iran, bordering Turkmenistan.
He is noted for establishing a rule for conduct in the khanaqah and also for the introduction of music (sama'), poetry and dance, as part of the Sufi collective devotional ritual of dhikr.
Current practice.
Mevlevi.
The Whirling Dervishes of the Mevlevi order are probably the best-known practitioners of Sama.
Mevlevi practitioners of sema are adult initiates into the order, which historically only meant men.
Participants move as a group in a circle while also turning each individually.
Art is "self expression" and Sama is "selfless expression"-an experience of "fanaa".
Fanaa (Arabic: فناء‎ fanāʾ ) in Sufism is the "passing away" or "annihilation" of the self.
Alevi/Bektashi.
Sema is prominent in the ceremonies of the Alevi community of Turkey and the closely related Bektashi Order.
The most common forms of Alevi sema include kirklar semahı (sema of the forty) and turnalar semahı (crane sema).
They are performed by both male and female teenagers, often in mixed groups, and participants turn facing each other in pairs or small groups and do not necessarily whirl as individuals.
Many cemevleri (Alevi meetinghouses) have organized sema groups that perform at events such as the annual Hacı Bektaş Veli Festival.
Tannoura.
In Egypt, the Mevlevi form of Sama is known as tannoura and has been adopted (with some modifications) by other Sufi orders as well.
It is also performed as a folk and concert dance.
Symbolism.
The Sama represents a mystical journey of man's spiritual ascent through mind and love to perfection.
Turning towards the truth, the follower grows through love, deserts his ego, finds the truth and arrives at perfection.
He then returns from this spiritual journey as a man who has reached maturity and a greater perfection, so as to love and to be of service to the whole of creation.
Rumi has said in reference to Sama', "For them it is the Sama' of this world and the other.
Even more for the circle of dancers within the Sama' who turn and have in their midst, their own Ka'aba."
This relates Sama' to the pilgrimage to Mecca, in that both are intended to bring all who are involved closer to God.
Components.
Sama emphasizes singing, but also includes the playing of instruments, particularly for introductions and accompaniments.
However, only instruments which are symbolic and not considered profane are used.
The most common of these are the tambourine, bells, and flute.
It often includes the singing of hymns, called "qawl" and "bayt".
Poetry is often included in the ceremony as well, because while it is inadequate by itself, it works together with aid in spiritual contemplation.
Any poetry, even the erotic, can be applied to God, and thus used for this ceremony.
However, the listener's heart must first be pure, or the dancing components of sama' will make these people full of lust instead of love for God.
Additionally, being in love with a person rather than with God clouds a person's mind when they are listening to erotic poetry.
Verses from the Qur'an are never used for this purpose, and not only because their meanings are said to be somewhat dulled through repetition.
Qur'anic verses are never to be set to meditation, nor ornamented or improvised in any way, so that they remain sacred texts.
Purpose.
Sama is a means of meditating on God through focusing on melodies and dancing.
It brings out a person's love of God, purifies the soul, and is a way of finding God.
This practice is said to reveal what is already in one's heart, rather than creating emotions.
All of a person's doubt disappears, and the heart and soul can communicate directly with God.
The immediate goal of sama' is to reach "wajd", which is a trance-like state of ecstasy.
Physically, this state may include various and unexpected movements, agitation, and all types of dancing.
Another state that people hope to reach through sama' is "khamra", which means "spiritual drunkenness".
Ultimately, people hope to achieve the unveiling of mysteries and gain spiritual knowledge through "wajd".
Sometimes, the experience of "wajd" becomes so strong that fainting or even, in extreme circumstances, death, occurs.
Etiquette.
Participants in sama are expected to remain silent and still, and controlled throughout the ceremony, unless wajd occurs.
This way, a higher degree of spiritual contemplation can be reached.
Participants must restrain themselves from movement and crying until they reach a point in which they can no longer hold back.
At this point, wajd can be reached.
It is essential that the trance-like experience of wajd be genuine and not faked for any reason.
Also, people must maintain proper intent and actions must be present throughout the sama'; otherwise, they cannot experience the ceremony's intended positive effects.
Controversy.
Muslims are divided into two groups regarding the issue of sama and the use of music in general: 1) Opponents, particularly of the Salafi/Wahabbi sect. 2) Advocates, who are mostly Sunni Sufis.
Advocates view chants as a required practice for spiritual growth.
Al-Ghazzali wrote a chapter entitled "Concerning Music and Dancing as Aids to the Religious Life", where he emphasized how the practices of music and dance are beneficial to Muslims, as long as their hearts are pure before engaging in these practices.
Opponents find music a heretical innovation or bidah and associate it with infidelity.
They compare the physical sensations experienced by a person in the state of wajd to a state of physical drunkenness, and therefore do not condone it.
In practice.
Due to differences in culture between Muslim groups, participation in musical performance is condoned in some and considered questionable in others.
Meditation and Sufi practices are allowed in Islam as long as they are within the limits of the Shari'ah (Islamic law).
People from all classes and walks of life can participate, although there is debate between Sufis and legalists about whether novice Sufis and ones more advanced in their faith are capable of achieving the same positive results from sama'.
The same debate exists for the young, and whether they are capable of overcoming their lust and clearing their hearts to worship God.
Jing zuo 
Jing zuo (pratisaṃlīna, ) refers to the Neo-Confucian meditation practice advocated by Zhu Xi and Wang Yang-ming.
Jing zuo can also be described as a form of spiritual self-cultivation that helps a person achieve a more fulfilling life ("6-Great Traditions").
Terminology.
The term Jing zuo simply means 'sitting quietly'.
The collocation soon acquired more specific meanings, referring to methods of quiet sitting that were practiced for medical or spiritual purposes.
In early sources, such as the philosophical work Hanfeizi in the 3rd century BCE, Jing zuo seems to have been mainly understood as being of benefit to health, but some centuries later spiritual practices were also referred to using this term.
At the outset, it was not limited to Confucianism, but could equally well be used about Buddhist and Daoist practices.
The term became widely used in the Song dynasty and became the preferred term for seated meditation among Neo-Confucians, who tended to avoid more narrowly Buddhist or Daoist terms.
In modern Western parlance, it often refers specifically to Neo-Confucian forms of meditation, but it is also used for other religious and non-religious practices.
Confucian meditation and Buddhist meditation.
The concept of meditation was not a major aspect of the Confucian life until the Neo-Confucian era.
At this time Buddhism and Daoism had begun to expand into China and started to influence some aspects of Chinese culture.
Even though there are some similarities, there are also some fundamental differences.
Confucian meditation, unlike Daoist and Buddhist meditation, does not require the stopping of rational thought, but instead relies upon disciplined attention to one's current situation and mental phenomena.
Its purpose is to develop as an individual in order to find full realization.
(Johnston 2006) As Zhu Xi notes in [Reflections on Things at Hand]: "Whenever you have to attend to your daily affairs, or undertake any matter, always spend some time in meditation and everything will be all right" (Zhu Xi, 4:25).
A central aspect of Confucian meditation is Jing zuo or quiet sitting.
Again, there is a fundamental difference between Neo-Confucians and Buddhist or Daoist meditation, in respect to Jing zuo (quiet sitting).
"Neo-Confucians argued that quiet sitting was oriented to this world and aimed at perfecting one's self, whereas Buddhist and Daoist meditation focused on forgetting the world and abandoning one's self."
(Yao 2000, p. 222).
Furthermore, "Neo-Confucian scholars take quiet sitting (Jing zuo) to be only a way to help understand one's gain in self-cultivation and they do not see it as a means to isolate oneself from human affairs.
They believe that it is only within this world and among worldly affairs that one can progress in the path of spiritual cultivation."
(Yao 2000, p. 223).
Significant figures in Confucian meditation.
There are two central concepts and schools of thought when it comes to Jing zuo.
The two schools of thought were started by Zhu Xi (Chu Hsi) and Wang Yang-Ming.
Each individual took a different approach; most would say an opposing approach.
Here, each approach is examined separately.
Zhu Xi (Chu Hsi).
Zhu Xi was very influential in the Rational School of thought.
Zhu Xi's concept of li was that it is the constitution of all things, the way by which the world runs its course.
This way of thinking and looking at li, when applied to Jing zuo, was that a person needed to combine both thinking and action in order to achieve enlightenment.
Investigation of things and the world around you were very important aspects and teachings of Zhu Xi.
"He also believed that knowledge and action always required each other."(Yao, p 220).
According to Zhu Xi, in order to achieve enlightenment, an individual must be actively seeking knowledge, investigating ideas/events, meditate upon them, and then investigate some more.
"According to this understanding, spiritual meditation is like a circular journey of tranquility and activity, or of preserving the mind and investigating the principle, or of knowledge and action."
(Yao, p 220).
For Zhu Xi, Jing zuo "does not mean to 'sit still like a blockhead, with the ear hearing nothing, the eye seeing nothing, and the mind thinking of nothing."(Yao p 220).
It meant actively searching out, investigating, and exploring the world that a person lives in. 
Wang Yang-Ming.
Wang Yang- Ming was very influential in the Idealistic School of thought.
Wang Yang-Ming disagreed with the approach that Zhu Xi had towards quiet sitting.
His concept of li was that it was inside every person, and reflection on li, which was manifested in you, is the only way to enlightenment.
Wang Yang-Ming believed that "it was right to search for sagehood within and there was no need to seek it in things and affairs outside.
Self-examination and inward exploration are enough for one to gain true knowledge and to be a sage."
(Yao, p 221).
Even though Wang Yang-Ming thought quiet sitting would be useful for his students he did not want it to be the only thing that they tried to accomplish.
Quiet sitting was only good if it would help them to grow in virtue and learn/ reflect on how they, as a moral person, should grow.
Purpose and fundamental ideas.
It is said that those who practice Jing zuo can "perceive the pristine ethical basis of human nature" and also be able to "grasp the essential emptiness of everything."
(Johnston 2000).
The neo-Confucians were also using Jing zuo as a method of "practical retreat" in order to grow and develop as individuals.
This included spiritual growth as well as the personal improvement and full realization of the practitioner (Johnston 2000).
It allows Confucians to practice veneration for the basic human nature and it allows them to "nourish the seeds of moral virtue" (Berthrong 1998).
Meditation embodies the state of serenity and calmness, where the practitioner is able to free themselves from and/or becomes unaffected by their surroundings.
They are able to clear and settle the heart-mind completely and are then able to assess their knowledge in an open-minded and unbiased manner (Wilson 1991): "The Master said, 'Hui is capable of occupying his whole mind for three months on end with no thought but that of Goodness.
The others can do so, some for a day, some even for a month, but that is all.`` (Analects 6.5) Jing zuo is said to be the "complement to prayer" (Wilson 1991) because "While prayer directs the heart to Ultimate Reality as a transcendent object, meditation cleanses the heart of all finite objects which obscure Reality so that its ultimate point may be found within."
(Wilson 1991).
Both prayer and Jing zuo are practiced and are essential parts of spirituality in Confucianism.
Jing zuo is understood to complement Zhu Xi's dictum to "investigate things" (in order to penetrate the principle (li) of the cosmos): 
For some, the reflection and meditation of Jing zuo must be balanced with studying of the Confucian texts.
It is beneficial when Jing zuo is used alongside Confucian scholarship, as it causes the Confucian to "center the self in service to others."
(Berthrong 1998).
Confucius himself advised against spending too much time sitting quiet and reflecting, he stressed the fact that Confucians should find a balance in their lives where they would study and reflect upon what one studies equally (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, n.d.)
: "'He who learns but does not think is lost.
He who thinks but does not learn is in great danger.' (Lunyu 2.15)" (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, n.d.).
Forms of meditation.
"The Confucian transformation model starts with individual meditation and goes through personal enhancement, self-discipline, personality integrity, family integration, state governance, and reaches the excellence of universal commonwealth" ("Confucianism.").
In order to achieve personal meditation, "one must learn to rest the energy (chu chu) in order to be stabilized (ting), be still and calm (ching), reach peace (an) and be mindful (li)" ("Confucianism.").
To have mindful energy, one must be "ready to learn the truth and reveal the virtue (te)" ("Confucianism.").
One form of meditation is personal meditation Qigong.
Qigong is when 'one sits still and frees their own character in order to get in touch with their true or real self.' ("Confucianism.").
Qigong "is a process of training the mind, body, and spirit with the aim of guiding ones thoughts so that they can prepare for further development.
It aims to internalize and calm the energy (qi) and to calm the mind, body and spirit" ("Confucianism.").
Another component is to desire and "reach a peaceful state so that one can become a thoughtful person to themselves and others" ("Confucianism.") around them through practicing qigong.
Another form of Confucian meditation is called Chou Won.
"Chou means to sit and Won means to forget one's self " ("Confucianism.").
The person simply sits, "lets go and allows God to work".
(Wilson 1991).
Chou Wong's main focus is to "detach the character from one's self and reach mental freedom" ("Confucianism.").
This form of Confucian meditation is "important because it teaches the practitioner many things to do with one's self: self-awareness, self-enhancement, self-discipline and self-actualization as well as learning how to find the truth and create social change" ("Confucianism.").
The "mental processes aim to rejuvenate internal virtue that leads to the insight of real self-awareness and universal energy interconnection" ("Confucianism.").
A main focus of these meditations "aim to incorporate mind, body and spirit for healing with the three main goals; disease prevention, healing, and human capacity development" ("Confucianism.").
Confucian meditation is used as "an empowerment tool for the Confucians and their family members by teaching them stress management, personal enhancement, family integration and career development" ("Confucianism.").
Influence on Confucian society.
Both schools of thought, Zhu Xi (Chu Hsi) and Wang Yang-Ming, influenced Confucian society.
Both schools edited and rewrote different aspects of Confucian volumes and texts, tried to clarify concepts and ideas of Confucianism, and helped to develop the spiritual dimension of Confucians.
Furthermore, both saw that it was very important to try to be a moral person; developing wisdom, loyalty, filial piety, compassion for humanity, and propriety; they lead to a better moral in society in general.
Confucian Meditation from the Great Learning 
"The Way of learning to be great consists in manifesting the clear character, loving the people, and abiding in the highest good.
Only after knowing what to abide in can one be calm.
Only after having been calm can one be tranquil.
Only after having achieved tranquility can one have peaceful repose.
Only after having peaceful repose can one begin to deliberate.
Only after deliberation can the end be attained.
Things have their roots and their branches.
Affairs have their beginnings and their ends.
To know what is first and what is last will lead one near the Way."
(Wilson 1991) 
Aspects of Christian meditation 
Aspects of Christian meditation was the topic of a 15 October 1989 document of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.
The document is titled "Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on some aspects of Christian meditation" and is formally known by its incipit, Orationis formas.
The document issues warnings on differences, and potential incompatibilities, between Christian meditation and the styles of meditation used in eastern religions such as Buddhism.
The document warns of fundamental errors in combining Christian and non-Christian styles of meditation.
Referring to the constitution "Dei verbum" the document emphasizes that all Christian prayer and meditation should "proceed to converge on Christ" and be guided by the gift of the Holy Spirit.
It reaffirmed that the Church recommends the reading of the Scripture prior to and as a source of Christian prayer and meditation.
Similar warnings were issued in 2003 in "A Christian reflection on the New Age" which characterized New Age activities as essentially incompatible with Christian teachings and values.
Warnings.
This document of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith stresses the differences between Christian and eastern meditative approaches.
It warns of the dangers of attempting to mix Christian meditation with eastern approaches since that could be both confusing and misleading, and may result in the loss of the essential Christocentric nature of Christian meditation.
The letter warns that "euphoric states" obtained through Eastern meditation should not be confused with prayer or assumed to be signs of the presence of God, a state that should always result in loving service to others.
Without these truths, the letter said, meditation, which should be a "flight from the self", can degenerate into a form of self-absorption.
The letter warns against concentration on the self, rather than on Christ, and states that: 
Christian prayer, ..., the communion of redeemed creatures with the intimate life of the Persons of the Trinity, based on Baptism and the Eucharist, source and summit of the life of the Church, implies an attitude of conversion, a flight from "self" to the "You" of God.
Thus Christian prayer is at the same time always authentically personal and communitarian.
It flees from impersonal techniques or from concentrating on oneself, which can create a kind of rut.
The letter also warns that concentration on the physical aspects of meditation "can degenerate into a cult of the body" and that equating bodily states with mysticism "could also lead to psychic disturbance and, at times, to moral deviations."
Structure.
The document has seven sections: 
Papal references.
Pope John Paul II later referred to the document in addresses at a general audience in 1999 and to a particular group in 2003, using it as an example of how Christians need to focus their prayers.
He referred to it also when saying, in the letter with which he marked the closing of the Great Jubilee of the Year 2000, that, by opening our heart to the love of God, prayer also opens it to the love of our brothers and sisters, and makes us capable of shaping history according to God's plan.
Related announcements.
In 2003, the Vatican issued further warnings regarding New Age practices including meditation.
Monsignor Michael Fitzgerald stated at the Vatican conference on "A Christian Reflection on the New Age" that the "Church avoids any concept that is close to those of the New Age".
Cardinal Paul Poupard, head of the Pontifical Council for Culture, said that the "New Age is a misleading answer to the oldest hopes of man".
According to the review of the document in "The Tablet" "there is never any doubt in the document that New Age is incompatible with and hostile to the core beliefs of Christianity".
Mind machine 
A mind machine (aka "brain machine" or "light and sound machine") uses pulsing rhythmic sound, flashing light, or a combination of these to alter the frequency of the user's brainwaves.
Mind machines can induce deep states of relaxation, concentration, and in some cases altered states of consciousness, which have been compared to those obtained from meditation and shamanic exploration.
Photic mind machines work with flickering lights embedded in sunglasses or a lamp that sits above or facing the user's head.
The user then "watches" with their eyes closed.
The process applied by some of these machines is said to induce brainwave synchronisation or entrainment.
History.
The influence of rhythmic sounds and drums to enter altered states of consciousness is used in different indigenous tribes (see Shamanic music), as well as optical stimulation produced by the flickering light of camp fires or pressing lightly on the eyeballs.
This "stroboscopic photo-stimulation produces 'photic driving', the alpha type of brain electrical activity associated with an altered state in which people are susceptible to suggestion".
( p.
12).
The first scientific observations were made by William Charles Wells in the 1790s who described different effects of binocular vision.
His results were later transferred to be applied in binaural beats.
Visual experiments with flickering lights were conducted in the 1940s by William Grey Walter who used stroboscopic light flashes to measure their effects on brain activity, assessed with EEG.
He reported effect not just on visual areas but on the whole cortex.
During the '60s and '70s the interest in different methods to induce altered states without the use of drugs were rising.
Some of the induced states by rhythmic light and sound combinations were even described as psychedelic-like, while these claims lack adequate measurements for their similarity.
In this line, numerous nightclubs began using strobes to maximize the effects of the music for dancing.
The development of alpha EEG feedback (see neurofeedback) is an important starting point for biofeedback and its explicit use for entering altered states of consciousness.
In these decades, Jack Schwarz built one of the first mind machines using rhythmic sounds and variable frequency lights in goggles to produce certain mental states.
Enterprises started to produce different types of mind machines and some scientists followed the line of research to explore if and how these devices elicit effects on brain processes.
In the late 1980s and early 1990s Farley initiated an investigation concerning medical claims made by some manufacturers and sellers.
The FDA concluded that Light and Sound Machines were not medical devices and did not warrant regulation.
Sellers and manufacturers were given guidelines for how they could advertise these devices, and were required to include a disclaimer and cautionary document with each machine.
Nowadays, mind machines are rediscovered by some teenage cultures as so called “digital drugs”, a legal way to enter altered states of consciousness.
Application.
Mind machines include flashing light devices, which are similar to the Brion Gysin dreamachine in that both produce a flickering visual field.
Unlike flashing light devices, the dreamachine can be used by several people at once, but has few, if any, technical features.
Technical setting.
Mind machines typically consist of a control unit, a pair of headphones and/or strobe light goggles.
The unit controls the sessions and drives the LEDs in the goggles.
Professionally, they are usually referred to as Auditory Visual Stimulation Devices (AVS devices).
Also mind machines are offered that can connect to the Internet for updates download of new session material.
Application rate.
One session normally takes between 15 and 60 minutes.
During a session the user should lie relaxed, and place the glasses on the eyes, which should remain closed during the whole session.
Many machines have pre-programmed sessions which vary in parameters like light brightness, audio pitch or beat frequency but also give the opportunity for the user to create a custom session.
Typically one session consists of a series of segments.
Within one segment parameters change in a constant way.
Mind machines are often used together with biofeedback or neurofeedback equipment in order to adjust the frequency on the fly, while proof for their effectiveness is lacking.
Description of altered states.
Perceptual changes.
Light &amp; sound mind machines can have various effects on the user.
Most users describe seeing a flashing light, others perceive swirling patterns that have been compared to psychedelic light shows or fractals.
A few users report seeing detailed, virtual reality like scenes.
But also tactile and emotional changes are reported after a 6 Hz photic stimulation, as well as auditory hallucinations like binaural beats.
Changes in brain activity.
Sessions will typically aim to address the target frequencies which correspond to delta (1-3 hertz), theta (4–7 Hz), alpha (8–12 Hz) or beta brain waves (13–40 Hz).
Those frequency bands can be adjusted by the user based on the desired effects.
For relaxation, often a reduction from beta waves to lower alpha or theta frequencies is observed.
It is aimed to reach a level of “slow alpha” (8 Hz).
Glickson (1986) states that an alpha frequency of 10 Hz is optimal for perceiving visual hallucinations.
He assumes that it's the change in alpha activity and not the alpha activity itself that is facilitating an altered state of consciousness.
After effects.
Even if research is not sufficient so far, Michael Hutchison and other scientists report strong tranquilizing effects that lasted up to 3 days.
After several sessions it is observed that users can produce a desired brain state with the associated brainwaves easier and deliberately.
Other information.
Therapeutic use.
Clinical research has been done on the use of auditory and visual stimulation to improve cognitive abilities in learning-disabled children as well as in the treatment of autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
However, lacking enough evidence to conclude that these treatments show efficacy, several studies indicate the potential to increase effects on IQ and reading levels in primary students, but also improvements in inattention and impulsiveness in children with ADHD (cite Siever).
Safety.
Rapidly flashing lights may be dangerous for people with photosensitive epilepsy or other nervous disorders such as migraine.
It is thought that one out of 10,000 adults will experience a seizure while viewing such a device; about twice as many children will have a similar ill effect.
Regulation.
Mind machine devices are legally available throughout the United States from many sources.
With some exceptions, these devices commonly do not have FDA approval for medical applications in the US.
They have been found by a U.S. district court to be Class III medical devices, and consequentially require FDA pre-market approval for all medical uses.
One company making medical claims for a possibly unsafe device has been shut down and seen their devices destroyed.
Teachings of Prem Rawat 

The core of Prem Rawat's teaching is that the individual’s need for fulfillment can be satisfied by turning within to contact a constant source of peace and joy.
Rather than a body of dogma, he emphasizes a direct experience of transcendence, which he claims is accessible through the four techniques of meditation which he teaches.
He calls these techniques "Knowledge" and says that Knowledge will take "all your senses that have been going outside all your life, turn them around and put them inside to feel and to actually experience you."
In his public speeches he quotes from Hindu, Muslim and Christian sources, but he relies on the experience provided by the four meditation techniques for his inspiration and guidance.
According to scholar and follower Ron Geaves, this lack of professed concepts allows his followers a freedom of expression which is spontaneous and personal.
Rawat places no outer requirements or prohibitions on those taught the techniques, nor does he regard himself as an exemplary leader.
Practitioners are asked not to reveal these techniques to anyone else, but to allow others to prepare to receive the experience for themselves.
Rawat has been criticized for a lack of intellectual content in his public discourses.
History.
Scholars have asserted that Prem Rawat's teachings originate in the traditions of the North Indian Sants, who dismiss all religious ritual and dogma and emphasize the possibility of a direct experience of God, who, they claim, "dwells in the heart".
Theologically, their teachings are distinguished by an inward, loving devotion to a divine principle, and socially by an egalitarianism that is opposed to the qualitative distinctions of the Hindu caste system.
Sants believe that the Guru or Perfect Master is an embodiment of God and a fitting object of worship.
Some of the more notable Sant gurus include Namdev (d.1350), Kabir (d.1518), Nanak (d.1539), Mirabai (d.1545), Surdas (d.1573), Tulsidas (d.1623), and Tukaram (d. 1650).
Other scholars refer to affinities with medieval traditions of Nirguna Bhakti (Sanskrit = "formless devotion"), with a similar emphasis on universalism, equality and direct experience, and criticism of blind allegiance to religious ritual and dogma.
Hans Ji Maharaj, Rawat's father and guru, was a devotee of Swarupanand, and became a guru in 1936 on Swarupanand's death.
He began presenting his message and teaching the techniques of Knowledge in the small town of Najibabad, near Haridwar.
His talks were strongly influenced by the reformist philosophy of the Arya Samaj, and he viewed himself primarily as the "Guru of the Poor".
His teachings were rich in metaphor and more concerned with practical applications than theory.
Unusually for an Indian teacher, he accepted students irrespective of caste, religion or status, and drew his share of criticism from traditional Hindus.
In 1936 he published a book "Hans Yog Prakash" as a first step to broadening the dissemination of his message.
Teachings.
Prem Rawat did not inherit a formal set of teachings nor did he develop one, as he sees conceptual thinking as the main enemy of the direct religious experience which he claims can be obtained through the techniques of Knowledge.
His central claim is that God resides in every human being and the human quest for fulfillment can be resolved by turning inward to discover a constant source of contentment and joy.
He gives equal billing to all religions, quoting from Hindu, Muslim and Christian sources, but rather than rely on scriptures for inspiration and guidance, Rawat relies on the experience provided by the four techniques of Knowledge.
This lack of professed concepts allow his followers a freedom of expression which is spontaneous and personal.Neither in the time of the father, Shri Hans, nor in that of the son, did the Divine Light Mission possess a systematically developed set of teachings.
Both saw [doctrines] as presenting more problems than advantages ...
The young Guru explains that conceptual thinking, translated with the English word “mind” in German translations also, is the main enemy of direct religious experience.
It is therefore hardly surprising that little firm information about DLM teachings can be obtained from his followers.
On the other hand, the lack of professed concepts allows them a freedom of expression which is spontaneous and personal, and which makes an agreeable contrast with the unexamined reproduction of received teachings [such as are found in other Indian-inspired groups.]&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1972 Rawat relocated to the U.S. and while his teachings remained essentially Hindu in origin and he continued with many Indian traditions, he managed with the minimum of Hindu terms and concepts, keeping his main emphasis on an individual, subjective experience.
His first western discourses were criticized by some religious scholars as evangelical and lacking in substance and for stressing direct experience over intellect or religious conceptual thinking.
A reporter at an appearance in Boston described Rawat as "...a real human being.
He spoke humbly, conversationally, and without any apparent notion that he was God.
In fact he seemed to consciously undercut the divine stage show and the passionate words said in his honor.
Devotees and mahatmas speak of him as the guy who will out-Christ Christ, yet the guru himself claims, not that he is divine, but that his Knowledge is".
Sociologist James Downton observed that from his early beginnings Rawat appealed to his followers to give up the concepts and beliefs that might impede them from fully experiencing the "Knowledge" or life force, but this did not prevent them from adopting a fairly rigid set of ideas about his divinity, and to project millennial preconceptions onto him and the movement.
Stephen A. Kent, in the preface of his book "From Slogans to Mantras", described his disappointment at hearing what he considered to be a poorly delivered and banal message by Rawat in 1974, and was surprised that his companions spoke glowingly about the same message.
Prem Rawat has never asked for payment for teaching Knowledge but it was reported that in the 1970s, some Indian mahatmas asked would-be initiates to empty their pockets and give what they had prior to receiving Knowledge.
In 1974, Rawat began using Western initiators to teach the techniques of Knowledge and continued to transform his teachings in order to appeal to a Western context.
By the early 1980s Prem Rawat had dropped the title "Guru" and eliminated the last of the Indian aspects.
Rawat does not see himself as bound by conventional beliefs or practices of any institutionalized religion or tradition-honored world view.
He is essentially an iconoclast who plots his route by pragmatic decisions to meet the demands and challenges that occur in his public career as a teacher striving to convince people of the value of self-knowledge.
Rawat claims that practicing Knowledge will allow the practitioner to experience joy, self-understanding, calmness, peace and contentment.
Practitioners describe Knowledge as internal and highly individual, with no associated social structure, liturgy, ethical practices or articles of faith.
According to Ron Geaves, Rawat speaks spontaneously, with an emphasis on an individual's subjective experience rather than on a body of theoretical knowledge, and he draws upon real life experiences, including his own, rather than on interpretations of the scriptures.
He is uncluttered by tradition in the manner of a contemporary Kabir or Nanak.
Rawat advises students that for maximum benefit the techniques should be practised daily for at least one hour.
He does not demand obedience, in that no outer requirements or prohibitions are placed on those taught the techniques.
The axiom, 'If you like it, practice it; if you don’t, try something else,' is frequently given in his public discourses.
Neither does Prem Rawat regard himself as an exemplary leader, a role often ascribed to religious founders.
The experience of Knowledge is described by practitioners as internal and highly individual.
The techniques are to be practised privately, and have no related social structure or hierarchy.
According to students, there is no liturgy or social obligation involved.
They also say that the techniques are universally applicable and their practice has no impact on, or relationship to, a student's gender, race, sexual orientation, economic status, religion, 
or national origin.
Techniques of Knowledge.
According to the Dutch religious scholar and Christian minister Reender Kranenborg and the American religious scholar J. Gordon Melton, the techniques of Knowledge are secret and were originally called "Light", "Sound", "Name" (or "Word") and "Nectar", but Maharaji now refers to them as the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th techniques.
Rawat asks practitioners to promise "not to reveal these techniques to anyone", but says to "let other people go through their own journey ... [so] they, too, can have the techniques when they are ready."
Kranenborg and Melton provide differing details of them in their writings but agree on a general description of the practices.
"Light" involves careful pressure on the eyes, seeking to open the "third eye" after a long period of training and practice.
This is comparable to similar Tantric practices.
"Sound" involves positioning the hands over the ears and temples, with the goal of hearing the "heavenly music".
This is reported to be related to sabda-brahman meditation.
"Name" or "Word" is a meditation concentrating on breath.
"Nectar" involves tongue positioning, eventually leading the student to taste the "nectar of life".
Michael Drury describes these techniques as helping the practitioner to develop "a deep and spiritual self-knowledge."
Teaching Knowledge / The Keys.
In his early days in the West, Prem Rawat or his Mahatmas (renamed to "Initiators" in 1974) conducted "Knowledge Sessions" face-to-face in small groups.
From 2001 the techniques were taught via a multimedia presentation made by Rawat.
In 2005, Prem Rawat introduced "The Keys", a program of five DVD's which prepare the student for receiving Knowledge.
The techniques are taught in Key Six.
A request from a practitioner who feels they are ready to view Key Six will result in an invitation to a Knowledge Session.
It is available in more than 50 languages (of which he speaks five himself: English, Hindi, Nepali, Spanish and Italian; the other languages are dubbed).
In this presentation, Maharaji explains the techniques step-by-step, to ensure that they are understood and practiced correctly.
This process takes 2½ hours, of which one hour is dedicated to practicing the techniques, 15 minutes each.
Before the presentation starts, people are asked to keep three promises: a) to keep in touch, b) to give Knowledge a fair chance, and c) to not share these techniques with anyone.
If attendees agree with these three promises they are invited to stay and receive "the gift of Knowledge."
The Knowledge Sessions are facilitated by volunteers who operate the video equipment and ensure the comfort of the attendees.
Knowledge Sessions are available throughout the year in most Western countries.
In special cases, such as people who are in hospitals etc., or are otherwise bed-ridden, the volunteers go to them to conduct the Session.
Reception.
Scholars.
George D. Chryssides writes that the Knowledge according to Prem Rawat was based on self-understanding, providing the practitioner with calmness, peace, and contentment, as the inner-self is identical with the divine.
Rawat emphasizes that this Knowledge is universal, not Indian, in nature.
Ron Geaves, who specializes in studies in comparative religion at Liverpool Hope University in England and who is one of the Western students of Prem Rawat,&lt;ref name="PIP/Cagan"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; writes that Prem Rawat himself has stated that he does not consider himself to be a charismatic figure, preferring to refer to his teachings and the efficacy of the practice of the four techniques on the individual as the basis of his authority.
The showing of the four techniques replaces the traditional diksha, and although it marks the sealing of master/disciple relationship, that is not emphasized in the session itself.
Rather, the focus is on correct practice and staying in touch through participation or listening.
Prem Rawat’s teachings make no reference to any traditional authority, neither person nor text.
Stephen J. Hunt describes Rawat's major focus as being on stillness, peace and contentment within the individual, and his 'Knowledge' consists of the techniques to obtain them.
Knowledge, roughly translated, means the happiness of the true self-understanding.
Each individual should seek to comprehend his or her true self.
In turn, this brings a sense of well-being, joy, and harmony as one comes in contact with one's "own nature."
The Knowledge includes four secret meditation procedures and the process of reaching the true self within can only be achieved by the individual, but with the guidance and help of a teacher.
Hence, the movement seems to embrace aspects of world-rejection and world-affirmation.
The tens of thousands of followers in the West do not see themselves as members of a religion, but the adherents of a system of teachings that extol the goal of enjoying life to the full.
They claim that Rawat's authority comes from the nature of his teachings and their benefit to the individual.
In Sacred Journeys sociologist James V. Downton writes 
Aside from all the psychological and social explanations one could offer to explain their conversions, the fact is that, during the Knowledge session or afterward in meditation, these young people had a spiritual experience which deeply affected them and changed the course of their lives.
It was an experience which moved many to tears and joy, for they had found the answer they had been seeking.
It was an experience which gave their lives more positive direction, meaning, and purpose.
It was an experience which brought them into a new relationship to life and removed many blocks to growth.
It was an experience-which sages have spoken about throughout history-of the oneness of life.
Marc Galanter (MD), professor of Psychiatry and Director of the Division of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse at the New York University Medical Center, writes that "over the long term of membership, meditation also played an important role in supporting a convert's continuing involvement.
An analysis of the relationship between the time members spent in meditation and the decline in their level of neurotic distress revealed that greater meditation time was associated with diminished neurotic distress.
This association suggests that the emotional response to meditation acts as a reinforcement for its continued practice."
That is, the more a member meditated, in general, the better the person was likely to feel.
Members apparently used meditation to relieve distress, both at scheduled times and on an ad hoc basis.
Paul Schnabel a sociologist, references Van der Lans, a religious psychologist employed at the Catholic University of Nijmegen.
Van der Lans says that among his Western students, Rawat appeared to stimulate an uncritical attitude, giving them an opportunity to project their fantasies of divinity onto his person.
According to these authors, the divine nature of the guru is a standard element of Eastern religion, but removed from its cultural context, and confounded with the Western understanding of God as a father, what is lost is the difference between the guru's person and that which the guru symbolizes—resulting in what they refer to as limitless personality worship.
Schnabel writes that this kind of understanding of the master-disciple relationship, alien to the original Eastern guru-disciple context, often ends in disillusionment for the disciple, who finds that the teacher in the end fails to live up to his or her expectations.
Former followers.
Reports obtained by Ted Patrick and several scholars after deprogramming of several of Rawat's former worshippers refer to the experience of Rawat's "meditation" techniques as self-hypnosis, and as diminishing the ability to think both during the practice and for an extended period of time after cessation.
Others.
Rawat has been criticized for a lack of intellectual content in his public discourses According to David V. Barrett, at the heart of Prem Rawat's teaching is the Knowledge, and the experience is an individual, subjective experience rather than a body of dogma.
In its Divine Light days the movement was sometimes criticized for this stressing of emotional experience over intellect.
The teaching could perhaps best be described as practical mysticism.

Mantram Handbook 
The Mantram Handbook describes methods of using a mantram — sometimes called a Holy Name — in daily living.
Benefits are also described.
Written by Eknath Easwaran, the book was originally published in the United States in 1977.
Several subsequent editions have been published, sometimes under different titles, in the United States, the United Kingdom, and India.
Foreign (non-English) editions have also been published in several languages.
The book has been reviewed in newspapers, magazines, and websites, and discussed in professional journals.
It has also been a focus of scientific research.
The subtitle of the fifth (2008) US edition is: "a practical guide to choosing your mantram &amp; calming your mind".
Topics covered.
Easwaran's "Mantram Handbook" provides an introduction to the practice of repeating mantrams and/or holy names, terms the author uses interchangeably.
The book offers the author's practical guidance for choosing a mantram and using it for personal centering and spiritual growth.
In the opening chapters, the author recommends selecting a single mantram (such as those in the table at right), and suggests that the reader "take your time choosing a mantram... then, once you have chosen a mantram, do not change it."
Most of the remainder of the book discusses how to integrate the mantram into daily living to improve skills and solve various types of problems.
Late in the book, Easwaran describes how the mantram can be combined with other spiritual practices, such as meditation.
Easwaran's approach is distinctive, in that he recommends a method of sitting meditation that does "not" focus on the mantram.
Accordingly, the entire concern of the "Mantram Handbook" is in how to use a mantram throughout the day, at times "apart" from sitting meditation.
With only slight variation, each edition of the "Mantram Handbook" has contained the same 12 major parts: 
The most recent (5th) US edition contains a foreword by Daniel H. Lowenstein.
Offering perspectives as a neurologist and medical educator, Lowenstein states that 
The book also contains an index.
Reviews and influence.
Reviews of the "Mantram Handbook" have appeared in  
"The Hindu", 
"Business Standard" (India), 
"The Economic Times" (India), 
"The B.C. Catholic", 
the "Pacific Sun", 
"Cosmos" (Australia), 
"Medical Self-Care", 
"Journal of Ecumenical Studies", 
"Journal of Psychology and Christianity", 
"Journal of Transpersonal Psychology", 
and "Booklist".
The "Mantram Handbook" has also been discussed in books authored by Andrew Weil, in books edited by Thomas G. Plante and J. Harold Ellens, and on websites such as "Spirituality and Health".
Andrew Weil stated that the "Mantram Handbook" "is the only book I have seen on the use of mantram as a centering technique."
In the "Business Standard", Apratim Barua wrote that  
Mantram Handbook... is concise, simple and practical...
Where Easwaran scores over other books of a similar type is in his non-sectarian approach and his appeal to common-sense...
Second, Easwaran's account is deeply personal and, therefore, all the more convincing.
He has traversed the same path himself and is aware of all the snares and pitfalls.
The tone of the book is cheerful, optimistic and positive...
The book is not merely about mantrams.
Its aim is the cultivation of a more wholesome and positive approach to life.
In the "Journal of Psychology and Christianity", Doug Oman and Joseph Driskill wrote that 
For people of any religious faith or none, Easwaran offers a highly practical yet consistently spiritual discussion of integrating a holy name into daily modern living.
Presenting the most comprehensive practical discussion of how to draw upon a holy name throughout the day in a variety of ordinary and challenging situations, this book is also uniquely universal as a resource for professionals working with diverse populations.
In "The Hindu", Anita Joshua wrote that  
Knowing full well the potential of the mantram in releasing new and positive energy that can help chase away seemingly incurable problems, Eknath Easwaran took upon himself the task of explaining it in the most simplest of terms and the way it works on the human system.
And, at the outset itself, he explains that mantram is not exclusive to the Hindu religion...
He signs off by explaining how the mantram relates to a large body of spiritual disciplines ... [and] is particularly careful to differentiate such spiritual disciplines from dogmas.
Also in "The Hindu", M. P. Pandit wrote that as an 
exponent of Eastern spiritual disciplines in the university circles in the West, Eknath Easwaran has evolved a style that makes abstruse concepts simple and appealing...
The author refutes the charge that the practice of mantra is self-hypnosis.
It is not that any word repeated for a length of time will have the same results... he explains mantra as 'that which enables us to cross the sea of the mind.'
Actually the traditional derivation is "mananat trayate", helps to cross the ocean of "samsara".
"The Economic Times" (India) wrote that "Easwaran strips the mystery off the mantram and explains how it can help us gain the will and insight to refashion our lives": 
The method Easwaran suggests is simple: pick a mantram of 'proven power' recommended by the great spiritual teachers of any religion that you follow.
Easwaran makes no attempt to avoid references to religion and the aim of his technique is, in fact, to take one closer to God.
Claims Easwaran: "Constant repetition and practice is required for the mantram to take root in our consciousness and gradually transform it, just as constant repetition makes the advertiser's jingle stick in our minds."...
Even a sceptic could benefit from the solutions Easwaran puts forward.
In the "Journal of Ecumenical Studies", E. James Baesler noted that "several of the eastern Christian and eastern Hindu traditions recommend reciting the Holy Name outside the predetermined prayer periods."
Most also  
recommend reciting the Holy Name during a time set apart exclusively for prayer...
The one exception to this pattern is Easwaran's ["Mantram Handbook"] recommendation to recite the Holy Name at virtually all times except the time set apart for meditation/prayer.
Easwaran's rationale... is that meditation times are for... the repetition of an inspirational passage, while repeating the [mantram] does not require as much discipline and thus can be 'prayed' anytime.
In the "Journal of Transpersonal Psychology", Thomas Weide wrote that "for a so-called handbook, the book mentions surprisingly few different mantrams, and omits much material commonly covered by mantram advocates."
But Weide recommended the book "highly to the total transpersonal public, not just to mantram lovers," stating that 
Easwaran writes with lovely simplicity about how to live a more spiritual life in general, and... gives a splendid explanation of how mantrams work, how to choose one, and above all, how to work on oneself in general, using a mantram merely as one of several important practices.
Similarly, Apratim Barua (quoted above) expressed concern that "The title is a slight misnomer.
The book is not merely about mantrams...
If anything, the number of mantrams discussed is woefully inadequate.
He takes up some four in all [sic], one from each major religion...
This may be due to the fact that the aim of the book is the cultivation of a more wholesome and positive approach to life."
In "Medical Self-Care", Thomas Ferguson wrote that the "Mantram Handbook" described "how mantrams work, how to choose one, and how to use it...
Spiritual, non-sectarian, quietly delightful."
"Booklist" wrote that "This guide by a Hindu expert on religions is refreshingly real.
He also contradicts popular misconceptions about mantrams and gives practical advice."
Sections of the book have been excerpted.
Research.
The "Mantram Handbook" was the primary instructional text in several research studies on mantram repetition conducted through the Veterans Administration in San Diego, California, by Jill Bormann and her colleagues.
Randomized trials that she led have reported benefits from mantram repetition that include higher quality of life, increased use of positive strategies of coping with stress, gains in faith/assurance and spiritual connectedness, and reductions in psychological distress, PTSD symptoms, and anger.
Additional research findings offered evidence linking mantram use with reduced stress, anxiety, anger, and PTSD symptoms, as well as increased quality of life and spiritual well-being, and documenting that study participants found mantram repetition useful for managing stress, emotions, sleep/insomnia, and unwanted thoughts.
The "Mantram Handbook" was also cited as a main source in developing a mantram-centered intervention for nurses in Korea.
The intervention was found to reduce burnout, and to enhance well-being, spiritual integrity, and leadership practice.

Sant Mat 
Sant Mat was a spiritual movement on the Indian subcontinent during the 13th–17th centuries CE.
The name literally means "teachings of sants", i.e. mystic Hindu saints.
Through association and seeking truth by following "sants" and their teachings, a movement was formed.
Theologically, the teachings are distinguished by inward, loving devotion by the individual soul ("atma") to the Divine Principal God ("Parmatma").
Socially, its egalitarianism distinguishes it from the caste system, and from Hindus and Muslims.
Sant Mat is not to be confused with the 19th-century Radha Soami, also known as contemporary "Sant Mat movement".
The lineage of "sants" can be divided into two main groups: a northern group from the provinces of Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, who expressed themselves mainly in vernacular Hindi; and a southern group, whose language is Marathi, represented by Namdev and other sants of Maharashtra.

The expression "Sant Mat" literally means "Teachings of the Saints" – the "Path of Sants (Saints)", "Path of Truth", "Right or Positive Path".
As "point of view of the Sants", the term "Sant" is pivotal.
Derived from the Sanskrit "sat" () and has overlapping usages (true, real, honest, right).
Its root meaning is "one who knows(is) the truth" or "one who has experienced (merged into) Ultimate Reality."
The term "sant" has taken on the general meaning of "a good person" but is properly assigned to the poet-sants of medieval India.
The Sants.
The Sant Mat movement was heterogeneous, and consisted mostly of the "sants" own socio-religious attitudes, which were based on "bhakti" (devotion) as described in the Bhagavad Gita.
Sharing as few conventions with each other as with the followers of the traditions they challenged, the "sants" appear more as a diverse collection of spiritual personalities than a specific religious tradition, although they acknowledged a common spiritual root.
The poet-sants expressed their teaching in vernacular verse, addressing themselves to the common folk in oral style in Hindi and other dialects and other languages such as Marathi, Gujarati and Punjabi.
They referred to the "Divine Name" as having saving power, and dismissed the religious rituals as having no value.
They presented the idea that true religion was a matter of surrendering to God "who dwells in the heart".
The first generation of north Indian "sants", (which included Kabir and Ravidas), appeared in the region of Benares in the mid–15th century.
Preceding them were two notable 13th and 14th century figures, Namdev and Ramananda.
The latter, according to Sant Mat tradition, was a Vaishnava ascetic who initiated Kabir, Ravidas, and other sants.
Ramanand's story is told differently by his lineage of "Ramanandi" monks, by other "sants" preceding him, and later by the Sikhs.
Sant Mat practitioners accept that Ramananda's students formed the first generation of "sants".
"Sants" developed a culture of concern for marginalized humans in society including women, and the Dalit ("Atishudras").
Some of the more notable "sants" include Namdev (d. 1350), Kabir (d. 1518), Nanak (d. 1539), Mira Bai (d. 1545), Surdas (d. 1573), Dadu Dayal (d. 1603), Tulsidas (d. 1623), and Tukaram (d. 1650).
The tradition of the "sants" ("sant parampara") remained non-sectarian, although a number of "sant" poets have been considered as the founders of sects.
Some of these may bear the "sant's" name, but were developed after them by later followers such as Kabir Panth, Dadu Panth, Dariya Panth, Advait Mat, Science of Spirituality and Radhasoami.
Only a small minority of religious Hindus have formally followed Sant Mat, but the tradition has considerably influenced Hindus across sects and castes.
Bhajans (devotional songs) attributed to past "sants" such as Mira Bai are widely listened to in India and in Hindu communities around the world.
The "sant" tradition is the only one in medieval and modern India that has successfully crossed some barriers between Hindu and Muslim faiths.
Julius J. Lipner asserts that the lives of many Hindus have been leavened by the religious teachings of the "sants", which he describes as liberating.
The Sant Mat tradition teaches the necessity of a living human master, who is referred to with honorific titles such as "satguru", or perfect master.
Similar movements.
Classical Gnostics, medieval Sufi poets such as Shams Tabrizi, Jalal al-Din Muhammad Rumi or Hafez, as well as Sindhi poets, are considered to have many similarities with the poet-sants of Sant Mat.
The Radha Soami movement in North India, also known as "Sant Mat movement", is regarded as a repository of the tradition of the Sants and their teachings, as well as their approach to religious endeavours, and presents itself as a living incarnation of the Sant tradition.
The most notable being Radhasoami Satsang Beas, situated on the banks of the river Beas, whose current Living Master is Baba Gurinder Singh.
According to Mark Juergensmeyer, that claim is also made by the Kabir-panthis, the Satpanthis, the Sikhs and other movements that continue to find the insights from the Sant tradition valid today.
Prem Rawat and the Divine Light Mission (Elan Vital) are considered to be part of the Sant Mat tradition by J. Gordon Melton, Lucy DuPertuis, and Vishal Mangalwadi, but that characterization is disputed by Ron Geaves.
The 20th century religious movement Eckankar is also considered by David C. Lane to be an offshoot of the Sant Mat tradition.
James R. Lewis refers to these movements as "expressions of an older faith in a new context".
Zhan zhuang 
Zhàn zhuāng (站樁/站桩, ) is a training method often practiced by students of neijia (internal kung fu), such as , Xing Yi Quan, Bagua Zhang and Taiji Quan.
"Zhàn zhuāng" is sometimes translated "Standing-on-stake", "Standing Qigong", "Standing Like a Tree", "Post-standing", "Pile-standing", or "Pylon Standing".
History.
The original Zhàn zhuāng were health methods used by Daoists; in recent centuries, martial artists who already had static standing methods combined these with the internal mechanics of Zhàn zhuāng to create a superior exercise.
The goal of Zhàn zhuāng in martial arts has always been to develop a martially capable body structure, but nowadays most practitioners have again returned to a health-preservation orientation in their training, and few teach Zhàn zhuāng as a martial method.
The word "Zhàn zhuāng" is the modern term; it was coined by Wang Xiangzhai.
Wang, a student of Xing Yi Quan, created a method of Kung Fu-based entirely upon Zhàn zhuāng, known as Yiquan, "Intent Fist."
Yiquan's method of study is Zhàn zhuāng plus movements that continue the feeling of the Standing Post in action.
The most common Zhàn zhuāng method is known as "Hún Yuán" (浑圆, "Completely Round," "Round Smoothness") or "Chēng Bào" (撑抱, "Tree Hugging" stance).
This posture is entirely Daoist in its origins, has many variations, and is the main training posture in all branches of Yiquan.
This practice has recently also become common practice in Taiji and Qigong schools.
In Xing Yi Quan, the practice of "Sān Tǐ Shì" (三體勢 / 三体势, "Heaven, Earth, and Man") has been a root practice for centuries.
Detail.
Those unfamiliar with Zhàn zhuāng can experience severe muscle fatigue and subsequent trembling at first.
Later, once sufficient stamina and strength have been developed, the practitioner can use Zhàn zhuāng to work on developing the sensation of "opposing forces," as well as one's central equilibrium and sensitivity to specific areas of tension in the body.
Zhàn zhuāng has a strong connection with Traditional Chinese Medicine.
Some schools use the practice as a way of removing blockages in Qi flow, believing Zhàn zhuāng, when correctly practiced, has a normalizing effect on the body; they claim any habitual tension or tissue shortening (or lengthening) is normalized by the practice, and the body regains its natural ability to function optimally.
It is claimed that a normalized body will be less prone to muscular-skeletal medical conditions, and it is also believed that Zhàn zhuāng, when practiced for developing relaxed postures, will lead to a beneficial calming effect.
The Dan Tian is also involved in the practice of Zhàn zhuāng.
The amount of time spent practicing Zhàn zhuāng varies between styles and schools; one may spend anywhere from two minutes to two hours standing in one posture.
Many styles, especially the internal styles, combine Post Standing with Qigong training and other coordinated-body methods to develop whole-body coordination for martial purposes.
The martial practice is thought to strengthen the body's Central Nervous System and develop the coordination required for effective martial performance.
In Yiquan, a clear distinction is made between "health" postures and "martially oriented" postures.
In Bagua Zhang's circle-walking practice, the upper body is held as a Zhàn zhuāng posture, while the lower body is more dynamic.
Counting sheep 
Counting sheep is a mental exercise used in some Western cultures as a means of putting oneself to sleep.
In most depictions of the activity, the practitioner envisions an endless series of identical white sheep jumping over a fence, while counting them as they do so.
The idea, presumably, is to induce boredom while occupying the mind with something simple, repetitive, and rhythmic, all of which are known to help humans sleep.
Although the practice is largely a stereotype, and rarely used as a solution for insomnia, it has been so commonly referenced by cartoons, comic strips, and other mass media, that it has become deeply engrained into popular culture's notion of sleep.
The term "counting sheep" has entered the English language as an idiomatic term for insomnia.
Sheep themselves have become associated with sleep, or lack thereof.
Effectiveness.
The effectiveness of the method may depend upon the mental power required.
An experiment conducted by researchers at Oxford University, though not involving livestock as the object of visualization, found that subjects who imagined "a beach or a waterfall" were forced to expend more mental energy, and fell asleep faster, than those asked to "simply distract from thoughts, worries and concerns."
Sleep could be achieved by any number of complex activities that expend mental energy.
Origin.
An early reference to counting sheep as a means of attaining sleep can be found in "Illustrations of Political Economy" by Harriet Martineau, from 1832: 
"It was a sight of monotony to behold one sheep after another follow the adventurous one, each in turn placing its fore-feet on the breach in the fence, bringing up its hind legs after it, looking around for an instant from the summit, and then making the plunge into the dry ditch, tufted with locks of wool.
The process might have been more composing if the field might have been another man's property, or if the flock had been making its way out instead of in; but the recollection of the scene of transit served to send the landowner to sleep more than once, when occurring at the end of the train of anxious thoughts which had kept him awake."
(p. 355–356) 
An even earlier reference can be found in "Don Quixote" by Miguel de Cervantes, from 1605 (the exception being Cervantes substituting "goats" for "sheep"):  
"Let your worship keep count of the goats the fisherman is taking across, for if one escapes the memory there will be an end of the story, and it will be impossible to tell another word of it."
Cervantes probably adapted the story of counting goats from a story of counting sheep in the early twelfth-century Spanish work "Disciplina clericalis".
The section The King and his Story-teller (section 12) uses the idea of counting sheep humorously.
"Disciplina clericalis" draws mainly on literary sources from the Islamic world.
Counting sheep was probably a widely recognized practice in the Islamic world before the early twelfth century.
Several late 19th-century writers mention the use of counting sheep in order to aid sleep; the period of the 1860s–70s appears to be when it became a commonplace term, for example in Sabine Baring-Gould's "Through flood and flame" (1868): "She turned her face to the wall with a weary sigh, and endeavoured, by counting sheep going through a hedge-gap, to trick sleep into closing her eyelids."
Macfarlane, Alexander William wrote about the technique in "Insomnia and Its Therapeutics" (1891).
In popular culture.
Serta, an American mattress manufacturer, uses animated sheep characters in its "Counting Sheep" advertising campaign, which it launched in 2000.
The advertisements and characters were created by Aardman Animations.
In Goodnight Mr. Bean, the thirteenth episode of the "Mr. Bean" television series, the titular character has difficulty falling asleep.
After failing other methods, he takes out a picture of a flock of sheep and begins counting them, first with his finger and then, after losing count a few times, with the assistance of a calculator.
When he sees the number of sheep (albeit inaccurate) on the calculator display, he finally and instantly falls asleep.
In "Shaun the Sheep Championsheeps", a 2012 series of sports-themed animated shorts, the "counting sheep" cliché is referenced in the episode entitled "Steeplechase".
In the short, Shaun and his fellow sheep participate in the steeplechase event.
Bitzer the dog, who is the referee, and the other sheep and farm animals, who are spectators, all fall asleep watching Shaun and the other sheep running around the track and jumping over the hurdles.
The title of Philip K. Dick's science fiction novel, "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?", references this term.
Autogenic training 
Autogenic training is a desensitization-relaxation technique developed by the German psychiatrist Johannes Heinrich Schultz by which a psychophysiologically determined relaxation response is obtained.
The technique was first published in 1932.
Studying the self-reports of people immersed in a hypnotic state, J.H. Schultz noted that physiological changes are accompanied by certain feelings.
Abbé Faria and Émile Coué are the forerunners of Schultz.
The technique involves repetitions of a set of visualisations that induce a state of relaxation and is based on passive concentration of bodily perceptions (e.g., heaviness and warmth of arms, legs), which are facilitated by self-suggestions.
The technique is used to alleviate many stress-induced psychosomatic disorders.
Biofeedback practitioners integrate basic elements of autogenic imagery and have simplified versions of parallel techniques that are used in combination with biofeedback.
This was done at the Menninger Foundation by Elmer Green, Steve Fahrion, Patricia Norris, Joe Sargent, Dale Walters and others.
They incorporated the hand warming imagery of autogenic training and used it as an aid to develop thermal biofeedback.
History.
The roots of this technique lie in the research carried out by Oscar Vogt in the field of sleep and hypnosis.
Vogt investigated individuals who had experience in hypnotic sessions.
Under his guidance, they were able to go into a state (similar to a hypnotic state) for a self-determined period of time.
These short-term mental exercises appeared to reduce stress or effects such as fatigue and tension.
In the meantime, other disturbing effects (e.g. headaches) could be avoided.
Inspired by this research and Vogt's work, Johannes Heinrich Schultz became interested in the phenomenon of autosuggestion.
He wanted to explore an approach, which would avoid undesirable implications of hypnotherapy (e.g., the passivity of the individual and dependency on the therapist).
When he was investigating hallucinations in healthy persons, he found that a majority of the subjects reported having two types of experienced sensation: heaviness in the extremities and feeling of warmth.
Schultz wanted to understand whether simply imagining a state of heaviness and warmth in one's limbs could induce a state similar to hypnosis.
Based on this idea he developed six basic exercises.
Autogenic training was popularized in North America and the English-speaking world by Wolfgang Luthe, who co-authored, with Schultz, a multi-volume tome on autogenic training.
In 1963 Luthe discovered the significance of "autogenic discharges", paroxysmic phenomena of motor, sensorial, visual and emotional nature related to the traumatic history of the patient, and developed the method of "autogenic abreaction".
His disciple Luis de Rivera, a McGill University-trained psychiatrist, introduced psychodynamic concepts into Luthe's approach, developing "autogenic analysis" as a new method for uncovering the unconscious.
Practice and effects.
The main purpose of autogenic training is the achievement of autonomic self-regulation by removing environmental distraction, training imagery that accompanies autonomic self-regulation, and by providing a facilitative set of exercises that are easy to learn and remember.
Autogenic training is based on three main principles: 
In the context of autogenic training passive concentration means that the trainee is instructed to concentrate on inner sensations rather than environmental stimuli.
Passiveness refers to allowing sensations to happen and being an observer rather than a manipulator.
The training can be performed in different postures: 
The technique consists of six standard exercises according to Schultz: 
When a new exercise step is added in autogenic training, the trainee should always concentrate initially on the already learned exercises and then add a new exercise.
In the beginning, a new exercise is added for only brief periods.
According to the specific clinical needs, different modifications of formulas are used.
These modifications can be classified into 3 main types: 
A study by Spencer suggests that autogenic training restores the balance between the activity of the sympathetic (flight or fight) and the parasympathetic (rest and digest) branches of the autonomic nervous system.
The author hypothesizes that this can have important health benefits, as the parasympathetic activity promotes digestion and bowel movements, lowers the blood pressure, slows the heart rate, and promotes the functions of the immune system.
Neurophysiological aspects.
There is a lack of neurophysiological investigations addressing this topic; however, one EEG study from 1963 suggests that the decrease in afferent stimulation induces: 
The same study suggests that EEG patterns obtained from subjects with different level of practice are not similar.
Another study from 1958 hypothesizes that autogenic state is between the normal waking state and sleep.
It suggests that EEG patterns occurring during autogenic training are similar to electrophysiological changes occurring during initial stages of sleep.
Contraindications.
Autogenic training is contra-indicated for children below the age of 5 and the individuals whose symptoms cannot be controlled.
Clinical application and evidence.
Autogenic training has different applications and is used in a variety of pathophysiological conditions, such as bronchial asthma or hypertension, as well as psychological disorders e.g. anxiety and depression.
Autogenic training has been subject to clinical evaluation from its early days in Germany, and from the early 1980s worldwide.
In 2002, a meta-analysis of 60 studies was published in "Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback", finding significant positive effects of treatment when compared to normals over a number of diagnoses; finding these effects to be similar to best recommended rival therapies; and finding positive additional effects by patients, such as their perceived quality of life.
Autogenic training is recommended in the 2016 European Society of Cardiology Guideline for prevention of cardiovascular disease in persons who experience psychosocial problems.
The International Journal of Dermatology conducted a study and found that Autogenic Training was potentially helpful for improving aged skin in women experiencing menopause.
In Japan, researchers from the Tokyo Psychology and Counseling Service Center have formulated a measure for reporting clinical effectiveness of autogenic training.
Versus other relaxation techniques.
The principle of passive concentration in autogenic training makes this technique different from other relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation and biofeedback, in which trainees try to control physiological functions.
As in biofeedback, bidirectional change in physiological activity is possible.
Autogenic training is classified as a self-hypnotic technique.
It is different from hetero-hypnosis, where trance is induced by another individual.
Autogenic training emphasizes a trainee's independence and gives control from therapist to the trainee.
By this, the need for physiological feedback devices or a hypnotherapist is eliminated.
Dancemeditation 
Dancemeditation is a moving meditation system incorporating art, somatics and the mysticism of Sufism.
The practice was developed in 1995 by Dunya Dianne McPherson after completing 1001 days of Sufi training with Sufi Master Adnan Sarhan.
The materials resourced provide doorways and ignition points to embodied spiritual illumination, healing, and growth.
Teaching Dancemeditation means to come from the embodied practices that have been honed within the practicing Dancemeditation community over the past 20 years.
Dancemeditation can be done alone, as a personal practice.
It is primarily offered in group environments with approximately – of the session engaged in shared, side-by-side solitude with the remaining time devoted to group interaction.
"Shared Solitude" can include quiet exercises with eyes closed on one's mat, to active dancing with eyes closed.
Group interactions include partner and small group exercises, entire group improvisation, and circles led by individuals.
Dancemeditation is occasionally offered in private session according to the teacher's preference, demographic, and goals.
There is an annual Movement Monastery which is a retreat period under the direction of Principal Teacher Dunya Dianne McPherson.
The official school of Dancemeditation is a network of independent, inter-connected teachers who have completed an intensive Certification training with Founder.
The training is completed primarily at Movement Monastery which includes time in a secluded setting to focus on practices, body cleansing diet, spiritual discussion, and silence.
In order to receive the initial Certificate level, teachers have completed 80 days of dedicated training.
Advanced Levels of Teaching Certification with more stringent criteria follow.
Teachers offer work in various formats and locations.
Many events are public offerings.
In addition, Dancemeditation teachers work through institutional settings—universities, hospitals, school systems.
Spirituality vs. religious systems.
Dancemeditation allows practitioners to explore and experience that which is deep, profound, and spiritual without having to adopt or contain that experience in a belief system.
In Dancemeditation, practitioners are free to follow their own intuition to where it needs to leads them.
A helpful guiding comment comes from Sufi Shervin Nekuee, (director of the Mystic Festival in Netherlands.) "Who am I to judge your mysticism?"
regarding Dancemeditation as a Sufi practice.
Dancemeditation doesn't ask its practitioners to define a higher power, or even have one, nor does it prevent them from having one.
It is primarily an ecumenical spiritual system, or a spiritual system that embraces interfaith pluralism.
There has never been, nor will there be, a request to follow doctrine.
The Path of Dancemeditation is a full valid Path in itself.
It is not an ancillary discipline to any other established Path.
At the same time, the Path of Dancemeditation does not obstruct practitioners from including other work on an equal level with the Path of Dancemeditation within their own hearts and efforts.
The music.
The music for Dancemeditation is primarily acoustic or "mildly enhanced".
Genres include world music, contemplative, classical, folk much of which has no lyrics or lyrics in languages that students will not typically understand.
This allows for deeper levels of concentration within the Self as opposed to the lyrics moving the emotions.
Basic components.
Basic components include: 
Basic practice subjects include: 
Spiritual belly dance components of Dancemeditation consists of the following subjects and exercises.
Training.
Spiritual belly dance has been offered at Kripalu since 2009.
Summer Movement Monasteries are offered yearly for two weeks in June.
Long and short training intensives, weekly classes, gatherings, performances and workshops are offered by Dunya, as well as by over 30 licensed instructors, internationally.
Juniper Foundation 
Juniper Foundation  
is an organization that works to adapt and promote meditation tradition in the modern world.
It was founded in 2003 by five individuals, Segyu Choepel Rinpoche, Hillary Brook Levy, Christina Juskiewicz, Pam Moriarty and Lawrence Levy.
Juniper calls its approach "meditation tradition for modern life" and it emphasizes meditation, balancing emotions, cultivating compassion and developing insight as four building blocks of meditation training.
Approach.
Juniper holds that Buddhist ideas have enormous potential to benefit modern culture but, to do so, their religious and cultural wrapper must be removed so modern individuals can access these methods in a way that matches their sensibility and psychology.
These methods must become integrated into modern culture just as they were in the cultures of India, China, Japan, Tibet and others.
The 14th Dalai Lama acknowledged this principle when, in his book "The Meaning of Life from a Buddhist Perspective", he wrote  
It is important to adopt the "essence" of Buddha's teaching, recognizing that Buddhism as it is practiced by Tibetans is influenced by Tibetan culture and thus it would be a mistake to try to practice a Tibetanized form of Buddhism.
Because Buddhist ideas value inquiry and critical thinking, Juniper holds that we can apply these to build a bridge from ancient culture to modern life, one that is grounded in tradition but evolved to embrace discovery and modern social norms.
Lineage.
Buddhist thought is not based on a centralized authority but is held in lineages.
Juniper's lineage is from an Indo-Tibetan Buddhist tradition dating back over two thousand years to the time of the Buddha.
This lineage passed through India and Tibet and came to Juniper through its Brazilian born co-founder Segyu Choepel Rinpoche.
In 1984, Segyu Rinpoche was recognized by the 98th Ganden Tripa, the spiritual leader of the Gelug (Dge-lugs) school of Tibetan Buddhism, as a master and holder of a Gelug lineage known as the Segyu (Sed Gyued).
Segyu Rinpoche's primary teacher was Kyabje Lati Rinpoche (1922-2010), the former abbot of Ganden Shartse Monastery, under whom Segyu Rinpoche received the full gelong monastic ordination.
For over twenty-five years Segyu Rinpoche studied under, and received initiations from, Kyabje Lati Rinpoche, Khensur Tara Tulku Rinpoche and other masters of the Gelug school.
In tandem with his training, Segyu Rinpoche studied Tibetan Medicine, a tradition of healing that integrates the philosophy and practices of the Buddhist path.
Through Segyu Rinpoche, Juniper works to pass the knowledge and methods of its lineage to others in a manner that propagates those methods in a secular form.
Location.
Juniper is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization located in San Jose, California.
Meditative postures 
Meditative postures or meditation seats are the body positions or asanas, usually sitting but also sometimes standing or reclining, used to facilitate meditation.
Best known in the Buddhist and Hindu traditions are the lotus and kneeling positions; other options include sitting on a chair, with the spine upright.
Meditation is sometimes practiced while walking, such as kinhin, doing simple repetitive tasks, as in Zen samu, or work which encourages mindfulness.
Postures in the "Yoga Sutras".
The "Yoga Sutras of Patanjali" describe yoga as having eight limbs, one being asana, the meditation seat.
The sutras do not name any asanas, merely specifying the characteristics of a good asana, stating: 
The "Sutras" are embedded in the "Bhasya" commentary, which scholars including Philipp Maas now believe are by the same author; it names 12 seated meditation asanas, possibly all cross-legged, including Padmasana, Virasana, Bhadrasana (now called Baddha Konasana), and Svastikasana.
Sitting on the ground.
Sitting positions, often cross-legged, provide a stable base for meditation, and have been used for the purpose in Buddhism and Hinduism for many centuries.
These include Padmasana (full lotus), Ardha Padmasana (half lotus), Siddhasana or Muktasana (also called Burmese posture, sitting with the knees on the ground and the feet tucked in close to the body), and Sukhasana (any easy cross-legged position).
Other possibilities are the kneeling postures Virasana (sitting between the heels) and Vajrasana or Seiza (sitting on the heels).
Another sitting posture, Baddha Konasana (Cobbler's Pose), is suitable for people who can sit with the feet together and both knees on the ground; B. K. S. Iyengar states that to meditate in this position, the palms should be held in prayer position over the chest, which demands some practice for balance.
Seymour Ginsburg, describing Gurdjieff meditation, suggests that such compact positions help the meditator to "include the entire experience of ourself in our attention."
The lotus position in particular can be extremely uncomfortable for Westerners who have not practised sitting cross-legged since early childhood.
They may, in the words of the yoga and meditation teacher Anne Cushman, be practising "self-torture ... apparently believing that bruising your inner thigh with your ankle is crucial to spiritual awakening."
The pose can cause beginners knee pain and injury.
Baddha Konasana is a safer alternative, provided the knees are not pushed down.
Cushman notes that since meditation is not a posture, no particular posture is required.
All the same, she writes, a formal method is helpful, and the asana chosen needs to be stable and comfortable, as the "Yoga Sutras" state: on the one side, few people would wish to hold strenuous postures like Downward Dog for half an hour or more; on the other side, a restful posture like Savasana (Corpse Pose) might be comfortable but would more likely lead to sleep than meditation.
The cross-legged postures are simple and stable, restful for the muscles, but active enough to keep the practitioner awake.
The spinal column needs to be erect and in balance; this poise lets the muscles of the back relax, and this in turn allows the attention to be focussed on the breath.
These conditions can be met by a variety of postures with or without support, whether a cross-legged posture such as Muktasana, a kneeling posture, or sitting on a chair with the back vertical and the feet on the ground.
The traditional support for sitting meditation is a zafu cushion; this elevates the hips above the knees, allowing practitioners with stiff hips to have the spine straight and upright.
Other postures.
In various traditions people meditate in other postures.
People who find sitting cross-legged uncomfortable can sit upright on a straight-backed chair, flat-footed and without back support, with the hands resting on the thighs, in what is sometimes called the Egyptian position.
Orthodox Christians may practice the meditation of hesychasm sitting on a stool, as was recommended by Saint Gregory of Sinai.
Theravada and Zen Buddhists sometimes vary their sitting meditation by meditating while walking, often very slowly so as to be mindful of each movement.
Standing meditation or "zhan zhuang" is practised in the Chinese martial art training system "Yiquan".
Viparita Karani 
Viparita Karani (; ) or legs up the wall pose is both an asana and a mudra in hatha yoga.
In modern yoga as exercise, it is commonly a fully supported pose using a wall and sometimes a pile of blankets, where it is considered a restful practice.
As a mudra it was practised using any preferred inversion, such as a headstand or shoulderstand.
The purpose of the mudra was to reverse the downward flow of vital fluid being lost from the head, using gravity.
Etymology and origins.
The name comes from the Sanskrit words विपरीत "viparīta", "inverted" or "reversed", and करणी "karaṇī", "a particular type of practice".
The practice is described in the 13th century "Vivekamārtaṇḍa" (verses 103-131) as a means of yogic withdrawal, pratyahara.
The pose was practised from the 17th century onwards in hatha yoga under names such as Narakasana, Kapalasana and Viparitakaranasana; its purpose as a mudra was to reverse the downflow and loss of the life-giving substance (Bindu) through the use of gravity.
In the early Bindu Model of Hatha Yoga, as described in the "Hatha Yoga Pradipika" and other texts, the vital fluid is held in the head but constantly drips down and is lost.
Mudras were thought to block the central sushumna nadi channel of the subtle body and work to force the flow back up, or in the case of Viparita Karani actually reverse the flow, using gravity.
A headstand is described and illustrated in halftone as Viparita Karani in the 1905 "Yogasopana Purvacatuska".
Description.
Viparita Karani can be any practice where one is upside down.
This can include the asanas of shoulder stand (Sarvangasana), headstand (Sirsasana), or handstand (Adho Mukha Vrksasana).
In the "Hatha Yoga Pradipika", as in most classical texts on haṭha yoga, Viparita Karani is listed as a mudra, meaning its purpose is for the directing of energy upwards within the body, using gravity's action on the inverted body, as opposed to asanas which are used in the "Hatha Yoga Pradipika" to create steadiness.
In one popular expression of Viparita Karani as an asana in modern postural yoga, it resembles Salamba Sarvāngāsana (supported shoulder stand) but with extension in the thoracic spine (rather than the cervical spine, elbows on the floor and hands supporting hips or lower back.
Variations.
In Iyengar Yoga, the pose, also called "Legs-up-the-Wall Pose", is described as "a restful practice, where the body is inverted without effort", and the lower back and buttocks are supported with a pile of blankets, while the legs are rested against a wall, either together or allowed to fall outwards into a straddle.
In Uttanapadasana, meaning "feet up pose", the back rests on the floor and the legs point straight up, either against a wall, supported with a strap, or free.
In Urdhva Prasarita Padasana, the back is on the ground, the arms are stretched out on the floor above the head, and the legs are raised either partly or to the vertical.
In pregnancy, the pose can be practised as "Wall Butterfly", with the buttocks and feet against a wall, feet together as in Baddha Konasana, the knees falling to the sides.
The hands can be used to press the knees.
Choiceless awareness 
is posited in philosophy, psychology, and spirituality to be the state of unpremeditated, complete awareness of the present without preference, effort, or compulsion.
The term was popularized in mid-20th century by Indian philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti; the concept is a central theme in his philosophy.
Similar or related concepts had been previously developed in several religious or spiritual traditions.
The term, or others like it, has also been used to describe traditional and contemporary meditation practices, both secular and religious.
By the as a concept or term had appeared in a variety of fields, including neuroscience, therapy, and sociology, as well as in art.
However, Krishnamurti's approach to the subject was unique, and differs from both prior and later notions.
Jiddu Krishnamurti.
Choiceless awareness is a major topic in the exposition of Indian philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti (18951986).
Beginning in the 1930s, he often commented on the subject, which became a recurring theme in his work.
He is considered to have been mainly responsible for the subsequent interest in both the term and the  
Krishnamurti held that outside of strictly practical, technical matters, the presence and action of choice indicates confusion and subtle bias: an individual who perceives a given situation in an unbiased manner, without distortion, and therefore with complete awareness, will immediately, naturally, act according to this awareness the action will be the manifestation and result of this awareness, rather than the result of choice.

He did not offer any method to achieve such awareness; in his view, application of technique cannot possibly evolve into, or result in, true choicelessness just as unceasing application of effort leads to illusory effortlessness, in reality the action of habit.
Additionally, in his opinion all methods introduce potential or actual conflict, generated by the practitioner's efforts to comply.
According to this analysis, all practices towards achieving choiceless awareness have the opposite effect: they inhibit its action in the present by treating it as a future, premeditated result, and moreover one that is conditioned by the practitioner's implied or expressed  
Krishnamurti stated that for true choicelessness to be realized explicit or implicit choice has to simply, irrevocably, stop; however, not as a result of decision-making, but through the ceasing of the functioning of the chooser or self as a psychological entity.
He proposed that such a state might be approached through inquiry based on total attentiveness: identity is then dissolved in complete, all-encompassing attention.
Therefore he considered choiceless awareness a natural attribute of non-self-centered perception, which he called "observation without the  
Accordingly, Krishnamurti advised against following any doctrine, discipline, teacher, guru, or authority, including himself.
He also advised against following one's own psychological knowledge and experience, which he considered integral parts of the observer.
He denied the usefulness of all meditation techniques and methods, but not of meditation itself, which he called "perhaps the greatest" art in life; and stated that insight into choiceless awareness could be shared through open  
Krishnamurti's ideas on choiceless awareness were discussed by among others, influential Hindu spiritual teacher Ramana Maharshi (18791950) and, following wide publication of his books, they attracted the attention of psychologists and psychoanalysts in the 1950s; in subsequent decades Krishnamurti held a number of discussions on this and related subjects with practicing psychotherapists and with researchers in the field.
His views on the subject have been included in scholarly papers on existential therapy, education theory, and peace research, but they have also been discussed in less formal or structured  
In almost half a century after he started discussing it, Krishnamurti included the concept in "The Core of Krishnamurti's Teaching", a pivotal statement of his philosophy: "Freedom is found in the choiceless awareness of our daily existence and  
Other representations.
In contrast with Krishnamurti's approach, other articulations commonly include choiceless awareness (or related ideas and terms) as part, or as the hoped-for result, of specific methodologies and meditation techniques.
Similar concepts and terms appeared or developed in various traditional and contemporary religious or spiritual doctrines and texts, and also within secular disciplines such as psychotherapy, rehabilitation medicine, and counseling.
Choiceless awareness has been examined within the context of philosophy of perception and behavior, while studies have cited its possible role in job performance.
Other studies have linked meditation based on the concept (among others), with neural activity consistent with increased attentiveness, considered a factor of well-being and  
One term that is often used as a near-synonym is mindfulness, which as a concept has similarities to or may include choiceless awareness.
Initially part of Buddhist meditation practice, it has been adapted and utilized for contemporary psychological treatment, and has been applied as a component of integrative medicine  
Related themes can be found in the doctrine and meditation practices (such as Vipassanā) associated with the Theravada school of Buddhism; and also in 20th-century offshoots such as the Thai Forest Tradition and the Vipassana movement.
Within these and similar fields, for example the Shikantaza practice in Zen Buddhism, choiceless (or effortless) awareness is considered to frequently be the result of a mature progression of  
The concept has been included in the discourse of transpersonal philosopher Ken Wilber (b. 1949), and also of independent Indian spiritual teacher Osho (Rajneesh) (19311990).

Among other fields, the term has appeared in dispute resolution theory and practice, and has found application in artistic endeavors.
In dramatic theory, theater criticism, and acting, it has been used to denote spontaneous creativity and related practices or attempts; it has additionally appeared in music works.

Kundalini yoga 
Kundalini yoga () derives from "kundalini", defined in tantra as energy that lies within the body, frequently at the navel or the base of the spine.
In normative tantric systems, kundalini is considered to be dormant until it is activated (as by the practice of yoga) and channeled upward through the central channel in a process of spiritual perfection.
Other schools, such as Kashmir Shaivism, teach that there are multiple kundalini energies in different parts of the body which are active and do not require awakening.
Kundalini is believed by adherents to be power associated with the divine feminine, Shakti.
Kundalini yoga as a school of yoga is influenced by Shaktism and Tantra schools of Hinduism.
It derives its name through a focus on awakening kundalini energy through regular practice of mantra, tantra, yantra, yoga, laya, haṭha, meditation, or even spontaneously (sahaja).
History.
Name.
The Sanskrit adjective ' means "circular, annular".
It occurs as a noun for "a snake" (in the sense "coiled", as in "forming ringlets") in the 12th-century "Rajatarangini" chronicle (I.2). ', a noun which means "bowl, water-pot", is found as the name of a Naga in "Mahabharata" 1.4828.
The Sanskrit feminine noun "kuṇḍalī" means "ring, bracelet, coil (of a rope)", and is the name of a "serpent-like" Shakti in Tantrism as early as the 11th century, in the "Śaradatilaka".
What has become known as "Kundalini yoga" in the 20th century, after a technical term particular to this tradition, is actually a synthesis of Bhakti Yoga (devotion and chanting), Raja Yoga (meditation) and Shakti Yoga (the expression of power and energy)."
However, it may include haṭha yoga techniques (such as bandha, pranayama, and asana), Patañjali's kriya yoga (consisting of self-discipline, self-study, devotion to God, dhyāna, and samādhi), tantric visualization and meditation techniques of "laya yoga" (known as "samsketas").
Laya may mean either the techniques of yoga or (like Rāja yoga) its effect of "absorption" of the individual into the cosmic.
Laya yoga, from the Sanskrit term "laya" (meaning "dissolution", "extinction", or "absorption"), is almost always described in the context of other Yogas such as in the "Yoga-Tattva-Upanishad", the "Varaha Upanishad", the "Goraksha Paddhati", the "Amaraugha Prabodha", and the "Dattatreya Yoga Shastra".
The exact distinctions between traditional yoga schools are often hazy due to a long history of syncretism, hence many of the oldest sources on Kundalini come through manuals of the tantric and haṭha traditions, including the "Hatha Yoga Pradipika" and the "Shiva Samhita".
The "Shiva Samhita" describes the qualified yogi as practicing 'the four yogas' to achieve kundalini awakening, while lesser students may resort solely to one technique or another: "Mantra Yoga and Hatha Yoga.
Laya Yoga is the third.
The fourth is Raja Yoga.
It is free from duality."
Hatha yoga.
The "Yoga-Kundalini Upanishad" is a syncretistic yoga text related to the schools of Hatha and Mantra yoga.
Other Sanskrit texts treat "kundalini" as a technical term in tantric yoga, such as the "Ṣaṭ-cakra-nirūpana" and the "Pādukā-pañcaka".
These were translated in 1919 by John Woodroffe as "The Serpent Power: The Secrets of Tantric and Shaktic Yoga".
He identifies the process of involution and its techniques in these texts as a particular form of Tantrik "Laya Yoga".
The "Yoga-Kundalini Upanishad" consists of three short chapters; it begins by stating that Chitta (consciousness) is controlled by Prana, and it is controlled by moderate food, postures and "Shakti-Chala" (I.1-2).
Verses I.3-6 explain the concepts of moderate food and concept, and verse I.7 introduces "Kundalini" as the name of the "Shakti" under discussion: 
Modern forms.
Sivananda Saraswati.
Sivananda introduced many readers to Kundalini yoga with his book on the subject in 1935.
This book has in-depth details about Kundalini yoga, and combines laya teachings from older sources, including the "Hathapradipika".
Yogi Bhajan.
In 1968, Harbhajan Singh Khalsa, also known as Yogi Bhajan, introduced his own brand of kundalini yoga into the United States, "Kundalini Yoga as taught by Yogi Bhajan".
Yogi Bhajan founded the "Healthy, Happy, Holy Organization" (3HO) as a teaching organization.
Former Kundalini teacher and scholar Philip Deslippe claims that Yogi Bhajan took yogic postures and techniques, attached them to Tantric theories and Sikh mantras, synthesizing a new form of 'Kundalini' yoga.
"When placed alongside the teachings of Swami Dhirendra Brahmachari and Maharaj Virsa Singh, it becomes strikingly apparent that at least in its earliest years, Yogi Bhajan's Kundalini yoga was not a distinct practice, but essentially a combination of yogic mechanics learned from the former and the Sikh-derived mantras ("Ik Ongkaar, Sat Naam, Sri Waheguru") and chanting from the latter", Deslippe writes.
Principles.
"Kundalini" is the term for "a spiritual energy or life force located at the base of the spine", conceptualized as a coiled-up serpent.
The practice of Kundalini yoga is supposed to arouse the sleeping Kundalini Shakti from its coiled base through the 6 chakras, and penetrate the 7th chakra, or crown.
This energy is said to travel along the ida (left), pingala (right) and central, or sushumna nadi - the main channels of pranic energy in the body.
Kundalini energy is technically explained as being sparked during yogic breathing when prana and apana blends at the 3rd chakra (solar plexus) at which point it initially drops down to the 1st and 2nd chakras before traveling up to the spine to the higher centers of the brain to activate the "golden cord" - the connection between the pituitary and pineal glands - and penetrate the 7 chakras.
Borrowing and integrating many different approaches, Kundalini Yoga can be understood as a tri-fold approach of Bhakti yoga for devotion, Shakti yoga for power, and Raja yoga for mental power and control.
Its purpose through the daily practice of kriyas and meditation in sadhana are described as a practical technology of human consciousness for humans to achieve their total creative potential.
With the practice of Kundalini Yoga one is thought able to liberate oneself from one's Karma and to realize one's Dharma (Life Purpose).
It is recommended to become free of desire or adopt vairagya before trying to arouse Kundalini.
Additionally, having a guru is beneficial in Kundalini Yoga, because a guru can suggest the best method to awaken the Kundalini.
Practice.
The practice of kriyas and meditations in Kundalini Yoga are designed to raise complete body awareness to prepare the body, nervous system, and mind to handle the energy of Kundalini rising.
The majority of the physical postures focus on navel activity, activity of the spine, and selective pressurization of body points and meridians.
Breath work and the application of bandhas (3 yogic locks) aid to release, direct, and control the flow of Kundalini energy from the lower centers to the higher energetic centers.
Along with the many kriyas, meditations and practices of Kundalini Yoga, a simple breathing technique of alternate nostril breathing (left nostril, right nostril), are taught as a method to cleanse the "nadis", or subtle channels and pathways, to help awaken Kundalini energy.
Sovatsky (1998) adapts a developmental and evolutionary perspective in his interpretation of Kundalini Yoga.
That is, he interprets Kundalini Yoga as a catalyst for psycho-spiritual growth and bodily maturation.
According to this interpretation of yoga, "the body bows itself into greater maturation [...], none of which should be considered mere stretching exercises".

Latihan 
Latihan (from Indonesian "latihan kejiwaan"; "spiritual exercise") is a form of spiritual practice.
It is the principal practice of the Subud organization.
Origin.
The origin of the practice is associated with Javanese "kebatinan" or "kejawen" tradition.
The practice.
"Latihan kejiwaan" (or simply "latihan") means "spiritual exercise" or "training of the spirit".
This exercise is not thought about, learned or trained for; it is unique for each person and the ability to 'receive' it is passed on by being in the presence of another person who already practises it at the 'opening'.
About twice a week, Subud members go to a local center to participate in a group latihan, men and women separately.
The experience takes place in a room or a hall with open space.
After a period of sitting quietly, a 'helper' typically asks the members to stand and relax, and then announces the start of the exercise.
Practitioners are advised to surrender to 'what arises from within', not expecting anything in advance.
One is recommended not to focus on any image or recite any mantra, nor to mix the exercise with other activities like meditation or use of drugs, but simply to intend to surrender to the Divine or the will of God.
(The term "God" is used here with a broad and inclusive intention.
An individual is at liberty to substitute interpretations that they feel more in tune with.)
One is not to pay attention to others in the room, each of whom is doing his or her own latihan.
During the exercise, practitioners may find that, in terms of physical and emotional expression, they involuntarily move, make sounds, walk around, dance, jump, skip, laugh, cry or whatever.
The experience varies greatly for different people, but the practitioner is always wholly conscious throughout and free to stop the exercise at any time.
Outwardly the exercise often manifests as physical movement and vocal activity that vary greatly both over time and between individuals.
It proceeds spontaneously, involving neither teacher nor method, being unstructured except for basic rules relating to group practice.
The capacity to engage in "latihan" the first time, in what is called the "opening", is said to be transmitted by the presence of experienced practitioners.
It usually entails an attitude of patience and trust, typically with some preparatory relaxation of thoughts and feelings, and involves the whole human being, not just body, emotions, mind or any other single facet.
It is regarded by practitioners as being of spiritual or psychological benefit, depending on personal interpretation and individual experience though apparently it does not affect all practitioners and may affect some detrimentally.
Many practitioners see "latihan" as a way of direct access to a mystical experience that is compatible with a busy modern lifestyle.
Use in Subud.
While the opinions of Subud's founder are often cited among its members, the organization officially endorses no doctrine regarding the latihan's nature or benefits.
Practitioners tend to agree that the exercise is best experienced with minimal theorizing or mental imagery.
Although "latihan" can be practiced alone, Subud arranges regular practice in group settings.
Normally sessions are held two or three times a week and last thirty minutes, with the two sexes segregated.
Subud offers formal pragmatic, preliminary advice in relation to commencing the practice.
Non-members are not allowed to witness Subud "latihan" sessions as they are considered private.
Subud's founder speculated that the spontaneous movements which characterise "latihan" are similar in character to early meetings of the Religious Society of Friends which gave rise to the name Quakers.
Active meditation.
The method was later adopted by Osho (Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh), who made use of many spiritual methods.
He viewed "latihan" as potentially beneficial, capable of cleansing the mind, yet incomplete and potentially dangerous to mental health since it involved surrender of self-control.
He therefore incorporated it as a stage of longer "active meditations", advocating the maintenance of a "witnessing consciousness", following "latihan" with a period of complete rest and preceding it with one of several techniques intended to promote an autohypnotic trance, and further recommended that, when practising in groups, both sexes should practise together.
Preliminary methods used include listening to quiet music, or else a breathing exercise intended to increase blood carbon dioxide levels followed by fifteen minutes looking at a strobe light while listening to music, both of these running at seven times the rate of the heart-beat in order to create an entrainment to alpha wave brain-state.
It may also be followed by a form of wordless prayer.
He agreed that it was easiest to learn in the presence of someone already experienced in the method.
History of Christian meditation 
Prayer has been an essential part of Christianity since its earliest days.
As the Middle Ages began, the monastic traditions of both Western and Eastern Christianity moved beyond vocal prayer to Christian meditation.
These progressions resulted in two distinct and different meditative practices: Lectio Divina in the West and hesychasm in the East.
Hesychasm involves the repetition of the Jesus Prayer, but Lectio Divina uses different Scripture passages at different times and although a passage may be repeated a few times, Lectio Divina is not repetitive in nature.
The progression from Bible reading, to meditation, to loving regard for God, was first formally described by Guigo II, a Carthusian monk who died late in the 12th century.
Guigo II's book "The Ladder of Monks" is considered the first description of methodical prayer in the western mystical tradition.
In Eastern Christianity, the monastic traditions of "constant prayer" that traced back to the Desert Fathers and Evagrius Pontikos established the practice of hesychasm and influenced John Climacus' book The Ladder of Divine Ascent by the 7th century.
These meditative prayers were promoted and supported by Saint Gregory Palamas in the 14th century.
From the 18th century some components of meditation began to be de-emphasized in some branches of Western Christianity.
However, the early part of the 20th century witnessed a revival and books and articles on approaches such as Lectio divina aimed at the general public began to appear by the middle of the century.
In 1965 one of the principal documents of the Second Vatican Council, the dogmatic constitution "Dei verbum" (Latin for "Word of God") emphasized the use of Lectio divina and on the 40th anniversary of "Dei verbum" in 2005 Pope Benedict XVI reaffirmed its importance.
Early Christianity.
The history and origins of Christian meditation have been intertwined with that of monastic life, both in the East and the West.
By the 4th century, groups of Christians, who came to be called the Desert Fathers, had sought God in the deserts of Palestine and Egypt, and began to become an early model of monastic Christian life.
The tradition of a Christian life of "constant prayer" in a monastic setting began in this period.
I 
In the 5th century, John Cassian described their life as prayerful and shaped by contemplation of God and Evagrius Ponticus wrote extensively on pure prayer and the Sayings of the Desert Fathers appeared thereafter.
The "prayer of fire" that emerged in this period, was said to have been driven by the love for God, which was to shape a life of meditation and contemplation in the East.
However, these "desert meditations" are not equivalent to the modern methods of reflection and meditation.
The desert monks gathered to hear scripture recited in public, and would then recite those words privately in their cells.
For them meditation was a memorization and recitation of scripture, primarily as a verbal exercise.
Early Middle Ages.
By the end of the 4th century, Martin of Tours had introduced monasticism to the West and the western monastic traditions began to take shape.
By the 6th century, the Rule of Saint Benedict included three elements: public prayer, manual labor and lectio divina.
The emergence of the Christian monastic tradition included the development of an austere and secluded lifestyle and practices that were intended to help meditation by freeing the mind from worldly matters, e.g. in his Rule for monastic life, Gregory the Great developed 12 steps towards asceticism based on abstinence and mortification of the flesh and search for humility.
In order to avoid worldly contamination by seculars (i.e. not monks or clergy) the Rule of Saint Benedict forbade a monk from eating with them unless the monk was so far away that he could not return to the monastery that day.
The Rule of Saint Benedict (chapter #48) stipulated specific times and manners for "Lectio Divina" - a meditative reading of Scripture.
Due to its specific blending of spirituality with moderation and balance, the Benedictine Rule became widely used by the 10th century, and became the de facto standard for Western monastic life in the Middle Ages.
After the 10th century, during the Byzantine Empire, the traditions of the Desert Fathers led to a style of life and prayer in the Eastern Church called hesychasm, developed particularly on Mount Athos in Greece.
St.
Gregory of Sinai is generally considered by most to be the founder of the hesychastic approach to prayer in early 14th century.
Although controversies appeared thereafter between Barlam and St. Gregory Palamas, hesychasm was eventually well established within Eastern Christianity, but never made significant inroads in the West.
While hesychasm involves the repetition of the Jesus Prayer, Lectio Divina uses different Scripture passages at different times and although a passage may be repeated a few times, Lectio Divina is not repetitive in nature.
The practice of prayer had undergone very little change in the West from its origins until the 11th century, at which point a major change took place via the introduction of methods of meditation.
Monasticism played a key role in bringing about this change, first to establish basic concepts about the forms of prayer, then introduce meditation and finally to emphasize that monastic prayer is inseparable from a specific "way of life".
From the end of the 11th century two specific genres of literature for prayer appeared.
The first was extensions of Augustinian forms of addressing God or oneself (e.g. his confessions or the Soliloquies).
The "Meditations of St. Augustine" became a popular reading item.
Saint Anselm composed "Meditations and Prayers" along similar lines, but it included no methodical elements and was simply a collection of material for Lectio Divina and the duration of the exercise was not specified.
The second genre an example of which was Hugh of Saint Victor, tried to put more structure into meditation that was then available within the monastic tradition.
Hugh wrote that there are three visions of the soul: "thinking, meditation and contemplation".
Hugh aimed his meditations as a way towards contemplation of God."
The approach was further developed by Guigo II whose "Ladder of Monks" is considered a key text in the field.
This second genre lead to methodical prayer, and approaches in which the imagination holds a strong place.
Guigi II (the 9th Carthusian prior) went beyond the meditations of Guigo I (the 5th prior).
For Guigo II, reading scripture is an "encounter with the word of God", meditation is "seeking the hidden meaning of this word", prayer is "turning one's heart to God" and contemplation is when "the mind is lifted up to God and held above itself".
Guigo II's Ladder of the Monks may well be the first description of the "methodical prayer" in the mystical traditions of the west.
By the 11th century Saint Anselm of Canterbury was producing meditative prayers, which however, still focused towards the monastic traditions of Lectio Divina.
Anselm began his Proslogion by calling it a "short work on an example meditation on the meaning of faith", and the meditations in the Proslogion are intended to lead the reader to a contemplation of God.
Anselm's teachings, which greatly influenced the monastic meditation traditions of the Middle Ages were that meditation can lead to "seeing the face of God in contemplation".
Latter part of Middle Ages.
Late in the 14th century Gerard of Zutphen had built on "Guigo's Ladder" to write his major work "On Spiritual Ascents".
Zutphen warned against considered meditation without reading of scripture, and taught that the reading prepares the mind, so meditation will fall into error.
Similarly, he taught that meditation prepares the mind for contemplation.
Zutphen's definition of meditation is generally considered the synthesis of medieval consensus on the topic of meditation: 
By the 14th century, the practice of meditation in the West had become more systematic as the arrival of "Devotio Moderna" in Germany and the Netherlands introduced more structure into it through the writings of Geert Groote, Gerard of Zutphen and Jan Mombaer.
By this time, the tradition of "methodical prayer" which arranged exercises day by day and week by week found significant following within the Catholic Church, as well as later Reformed communities.
In the 15th century, Ignatius of Loyola developed the technique in which the meditator enters the Biblical scene, e.g. begins a conversation with Jesus on the Cross in Calvary.
A similar idea had been developed by Ludolph of Saxony in his "Vita Christi" in 1374 in which the reader would make themselves present in the life of Jesus.
During the 15th century, reforms of the clergy and monastic settings were undertaken by the two Venetians, Lorenzo Giustiniani and Louis Barbo.
Both men considered methodical prayer and meditation as essential tools for the reforms they were undertaking.
Barbo, who died in 1443, wrote a treatise on prayer titled "Forma orationis et meditionis" otherwise known as "Modus meditandi".
He described three types of prayer; vocal prayer, best suited for beginners; meditation, oriented towards those who are more advanced; and contemplation as the highest form of prayer, only obtainable after the meditation stage.
Based on the request of Pope Eugene IV, Barbo introduced these methods to Valladolid, Spain and by the end of the 15th century they were being used at the abbey of Montserrat.
These methods then influenced Garcias de Cisneros, who in turn influenced Ignatius of Loyola.
The methods of "methodical prayer" as taught by the "devotio moderna" groups had entered Spain and were known in the early 16th century.
The book "The Imitation of Christ" which was known in Spain as "Contemptus mundi" became known in Spain, and while Teresa probably did not initially know of Guigo II's methods she was likely influenced by its teachings via the works of Francisco de Osuna which she studied.
Teresa's contemporary and collaborator, John of the Cross continued the tradition of Guigo II and taught the 4 stages of Lectio Divina.
18th–20th centuries.
From the 18th to the end of the 19th century the non-discursive components of meditation began to be de-emphasized in some branches of Western Christianity.
By the middle of 19th century, the historical critical approach to biblical analysis which had started over a century earlier, and focused on determining the historicity of gospel episodes, had taken away some of the emphasis on biblical meditation outside monastic communities.
However, in parallel, by the 19th century the importance of Biblical meditation had been firmly established in the Protestant spiritual tradition.
The non-discursive components or stages of meditative practice, which are often called "contemplation" in Western traditions, were beneficiaries of "a positive attitude toward contemplation [that] characterized the first fifteen centuries of the Christian era."
But "a negative attitude has prevailed from the sixteenth century onward," according to Thomas Keating, a Trappist monk and a primary modern expositor of the Christian meditative method of Centering Prayer.
Keating attributes the emergence of a negative attitude towards contemplation to several factors, including the 17th century controversy over Quietism and an increasing tendency to distinguish between "discursive meditation if thoughts predominated; affective prayer if the emphasis was on acts of the will; and contemplation if graces infused by God were predominant...
This division of the development of prayer into compartmentalized units entirely separate from one another helped to further the... notion that contemplation was an extraordinary grace reserved to the few."
Keating states that the "Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola" are "extremely important in order to understand the present state of spirituality in the Roman Catholic Church," but that there has been a "tendency to reduce the "Spiritual Exercises" to a method of discursive meditation."
The early part of the 20th century witnessed a revival in the practice, and books and articles on approaches such as Lectio divina aimed at the general public began to appear by the middle of the century.
In 1965 one of the principal documents of the Second Vatican Council, the dogmatic constitution "Dei verbum" (Latin for "Word of God") emphasized the use of Lectio divina.
On the 40th anniversary of "Dei verbum" in 2005 Pope Benedict XVI reaffirmed its importance and stated: 
The 20th century has also witnessed a new focus on Biblical meditation.
These may be defined as: "the devotional practice of pondering the words of a verse or verses of Scripture with a receptive heart."
Modern Biblical meditations may be designed to relate and connect the Biblical message to the modern world.
Such Biblical meditations may correspond to specific seasons such as Lent with the meditation topic selected to interact with two or three readings of the Bible during weekdays or Sundays of Lent.
The meditation sequence may begin by a summary of the Bible reading, then suggest specific ideas for meditation, then conclude with an appropriate prayer.
Such meditations may also be designed not just for "strong seasons" such as Lent or Easter, but also for Ordinary Time.
In the 20th century methods of Christian meditations have been taught using relatively new devotions such as the Divine Mercy devotion.
Brain activity and meditation 
Meditation and its effect on brain activity and the central nervous system became a focus of collaborative research in neuroscience, psychology and neurobiology during the latter half of the 20th century.
Research on meditation sought to define and characterize various practices.
Meditation's effect on the brain can be broken up into two categories: state changes and trait changes, respectively alterations in brain activities during the act of meditating and changes that are the outcome of long-term practice.
Mindfulness meditation, a Buddhist meditation approach found in Zen and Vipassana, is frequently studied.
Jon Kabat-Zinn describes mindfulness meditation as complete, unbiased attention to the current moment.
Changes in brain state.
Electroencephalography.
Electroencephalography (EEG) has been used in many studies as a primary method for evaluating the meditating brain.
Electroencephalography uses electrical leads placed all over the scalp to measure the collective electrical activity of the cerebral cortex.
Specifically, EEG measures the electric fields of large groups of neurons.
EEG has the benefit of excellent temporal resolution and is able to measure aggregate activity of portions or the entire cortex down to the millisecond scale.
Unlike other imaging based methods, EEG does not have good spatial resolution and is more appropriately used to evaluate the running spontaneous activity of the cortex.
This spontaneous activity is classified into four main classifications based on the frequency of the activity, ranging from low frequency delta waves (&lt; 4 Hz) commonly found during sleep to beta waves (13–30 Hz) associated with an awake and alert brain.
In between these two extremes are theta waves (4–8 Hz) and alpha waves (8–12 Hz).
Many studies on mindfulness meditation, assessed in a review by Cahn and Polich in 2006, have linked lower frequency alpha waves, as well as theta waves, to meditation.
Much older studies report more specific findings, such as decreased alpha blocking and increased frontal lobe specific theta activity.
Alpha blocking is a phenomenon where the active brain, normally presenting beta wave activity, cannot as easily switch to alpha wave activity often involved in memory recall.
These findings would suggest that in a meditative state a person is more relaxed but maintains a sharp awareness.
Two large, comprehensive review works, however, point to poor control and statistical analyses in these early studies and comment that it can only be said with confidence that increased alpha and theta wave activity exists.
Neuroimaging.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is another highly utilized methodology for studying state changes in meditating brains. fMRI detects subtle increases in blood flow to areas of the brain with higher metabolic activity.
Thus these areas of increased metabolic activity indicate which regions of the brain are currently being used to process whatever stimuli presented.
Counter to EEG, the advantage of fMRI is its spatial resolution, with the ability to produce detailed spatial maps of brain activity.
It suffers, however, in temporal resolution and cannot measure progressive activity, like the EEG, with much detail.
Topographical findings.
As a relatively new technology, fMRI has only recently been used to assess brain state changes during meditation.
Studies have shown heightened activity in the anterior cingulate cortex, frontal cortex, and prefrontal cortex, specifically in the dorsal medial prefrontal area during Vipassana meditation.
Similarly, the cingulate cortex and frontal cortex areas were shown to have increased activity during Zen meditation.
Both studies comment on the possibility that these findings could indicate some state of heightened voluntary control over attention during mindfulness meditation.
Review works by Cahn and Chiesa state that these results indicate consistency in meditation's effect on these regions of the brain, citing a multitude of other studies spanning other meditative disciplines, but mention the need for further investigation with better controls.
Study on meditation and emotion.
The review by Cahn also notes findings describing a heightened emotional state of meditators.
A more complex study, conducted in 2008 by Lutz et al., focused on emotional response during meditation.
This investigation involved the creation of a "compassion meditation" state by novice and experienced meditators and testing the meditators response to emotionally charged sounds. fMRI results indicated heightened activity in the cingulate cortex but also in the amygdala, temporo-parietal junction, and right posterior superior temporal sulcus in response to the emotional sounds.
The authors of this study believe this indicates greater sensitivity to emotional expression and positive emotion due to the neural circuitry activated.
Changes in brain due to the prolonged practice.
Electroencephalography.
Similar to research into state changes in brain function, older studies make more specific claims about trait changes in meditators versus non-meditators.
Changes to the alpha wave were indicated to be a trait, as well as state and phenomena.
Studies have reported an increase in the specific frequencies expressed in the alpha range, increased alpha band power, and an overall slowing (reduction in frequency) in EEG activity in experienced meditators versus less experienced meditators while meditating.
The alpha blocking phenomena, observed as a state change in brain function, was investigated as a possible trait change as well.
One study that examined a variety of meditation techniques tried to show that alpha blocking was affected by the long term practice of meditation by testing response to auditory stimuli.
Review works, however, comment on inconsistent findings as well as a lack of repeated results in this, and other studies.
They further remark that, similar to observations in brain state changes, only general assertions can be made about brain trait changes: some change in the electroencephalographic profile exists but with some inconsistency.
It is also important to note that these trait changes were observed during meditation, and although it does indicate that a practitioner's electroencephalographic profile is modified by the practice of meditation, these EEG studies have not yet shown changes in non-meditating brains, even of experienced meditators.
Neuroimaging.
Brain trait changes have also been observed in neuroimaging studies, most often employing fMRI.
In a meta-analysis of 21 neuroimaging studies, eight brain regions were found to be consistently altered, including areas key to meta-awareness (frontopolar cortex/Brodmann area 10), exteroceptive and interoceptive body awareness (sensory cortex and insular cortex), memory consolidation and reconsolidation (hippocampus), self and emotion regulation (anterior cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal cortex), and intra- and interhemispheric communication (superior longitudinal fasciculus; corpus callosum) These changes were distinguished by density increases in grey matter regions and white matter pathways in the brains of individuals who meditate in comparison to individuals who do not.
Of all areas with reported findings, a greater number of structural changes were found in the left hemisphere.
There is also evidence to suggest meditation plays a protective role against the natural reduction in grey matter volume associated with aging.
One study found evidence that Zen meditators experienced a slower age related decline rate for cerebral gray matter volume in the putamen which plays a role in learning, cognitive flexibility and attentional processing This could suggest a better attentiveness in aging meditators versus non-meditators.
Long-term meditation practitioners have also shown to have a higher tolerance for pain.
This effect has been correlated to altered function and structure in somatosensory cortices and an increased ability to decouple regions in the brain associated with the cognitive appraisal of pain (anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex).
The brain state changes found in meditators are almost exclusively found in higher-order executive and association cortices.
This supports the notion that meditation increases self-regulation and attentiveness.
Recent studies have also investigated how these changes may alter the functionality and connectivity of the default mode network, which is a hypothesized network of brain regions that are active when an individual is engaged in internal tasks such as daydreaming.
Validity of findings.
In the meta-analysis performed by Fox et al., several sources of bias were indicated which bring into question the validity of meditation studies which use neuroimaging.
Fox et al. suggests a publication bias may be leading to the over-reporting of significant results.
Despite this, however, Fox et al. found "consistent differences in prefrontal cortex and body awareness regions" in "areas key to meta-awareness..., exteroceptive and interoceptive body awareness..., memory consolidation and reconsolidation..., self and emotion regulation..., and intra- and interhemispheric communication..."
and that changes were significant with "moderate" global median effect size and "consistent and medium-sized brain structure differences."
More research will be needed before any firm conclusions can be made.
Popular literature.
Positive portrayal.
Besides scientific literature, some authors have written of the promising research on meditation in books targeted for general audiences.
One such book, Buddha's Brain by Rick Hanson, PhD shares the current scientific research and investigations into meditation.
Hanson, a neuroscientist and researcher, explains to readers the scientific studies in plain language and discuss the impact of the results.
Hanson's main argument is that positive emotions, like love can be strengthened through meditation in a neuroplastic manner, citing dozens of scientific studies to support this claim.
Hanson's viewpoint is representative of a larger popular movement to study and embrace Eastern phenomena including meditation in the Western world.
Criticism.
Critics, like Owen Flanagan, PhD, believe that Hanson, and those like him, are overextending the results of current scientific studies.
In his book "Bodhisattva's Brain: Buddhism Naturalized", Flanagan presents a more conservative viewpoint of current scientific research and cautions readers against the seemingly exciting results of recent studies.
Flanagan does not believe current science supports the idea that positive emotion can be strengthened in the same way that stroke victims can recover use of limbs with use.
Flanagan does acknowledge that meditation may be beneficial in some way, but the mechanism of how meditation affects the brain is still clouded.
Similarly, Awasthi argues that meditation is non-specific to the research studies showing clinical efficacy in some cases, though mechanisms remain unclear.
Flanagan and Hanson use many of the same scientific studies to attempt to support their differing viewpoint, but both authors identify the need and importance of future studies investigating meditation.
Meditation research is still in its early stages and a lot more replicable results need to be established before the science community can back its efficiency.
Bodymind (in meditation traditions) 
Bodymind is a compound of body and mind and may be used differently in different meditation traditions.
These different understandings often inform each other.
The Buddhist philosopher, Herbert V. Günther, has stated:  
What we call 'body' and 'mind' are mere abstractions from an identity experience that cannot be reduced to the one or the other abstraction, nor can it be hypostatized into some sort of thing without falsifying its very being.
Modern Western cultures inherited the concept of Cartesian dualism which isn't evident in many other cultures.
As a result of multiculturalism and globalization, the bodymind philosophies found in other cultures, such as in Navajo and Tibetan societies, have been integrated into the bodymind concept adopted by the Western New Age movement.
Vajrayana and Zen Buddhism.
In Vajrayana, Mahayana, Theravada and Zen Buddhism the concept of bodymind, or "namarupa", is key.
In Vajrayana, "namarupa" is informed by the related doctrines of heartmind and Yogachara's mindstream.
Within these traditions, Bodymind is held as a continuüm and field phenomenon.
Arpaia and Rapgay discuss the connection of mindbody in the eighth chapter of their book, "Tibetan Wisdom for Modern Life ", entitled "Health: strengthening the mind-body connection".
David E. Shaner, PhD, coined the compound term "bodymind" in his thesis work at the University of Hawai'i, "The Bodymind Experience in Japanese Buddhism", which he defended in 1979 and published in 1985.[2] 
Shaner translated the term 心身統一合氣道, Shinshintouitsu Aikidō.
Passage Meditation 
Passage Meditation is a book by Eknath Easwaran, originally published in 1978 with the title Meditation.
The book describes a meditation program, also now commonly referred to as Passage Meditation.
Easwaran developed this method of meditation in the 1960s, and first taught it systematically at the University of California, Berkeley.
The program is an eight-point program intended for the "spiritual growth" of the practitioner.
The first step in the program involves meditating on a text passage, and since the 1990s the method as a whole has come to be known as "Passage Meditation" (not Easwaran's term).
The book has been frequently reprinted and translated into 14 languages.
It is reported that more than 200,000 copies were sold in the period of 1978 to 2001.
The first edition of the book had the full title "Meditation; commonsense directions for an uncommon life" (1978).
A second edition in 1991 was subtitled "a simple eight-point program for translating spiritual ideals into daily life", and a third, revised edition of the book was published posthumously as "Passage Meditation; Bringing the Deep Wisdom of the Heart Into Daily Life" (2008).
A fourth, revised edition was published as "Passage Meditation – A Complete Spiritual Practice: Train Your Mind and Find a Life that Fulfills" (2016).
The fourth edition included a new part, not contained in earlier editions, with approximately 80 pages of "Questions and Answers" to numerous questions about meditation (pp. 182–264).
Topics covered.
All editions of "Passage Meditation" contain a chapter dedicated to each of the eight practices or "points" of Easwaran's method of meditation.
Each edition also contains a preface by the author in which he explains how he discovered the passage meditation method.
Method.
Meditating on a passage is the first point in Easwaran's eight point program of Passage Meditation, and he recommends practicing it for 30 minutes each day on first rising.
The other seven points are to be woven in at various times throughout the day or week.
Each of the book's eight main chapters are dedicated to explaining one of the eight points: 
Meditation on a passage involves silent, focused repetition during meditation of memorized selections from scriptures of the world and writings of great mystics.
According to Easwaran, the practice of meditating on a specific passage of text (Easwaran suggests the Prayer of Saint Francis or Psalm 23 as examples) has the effect of eventually transforming "character, conduct, and consciousness."
The term passage is chosen to describe a spiritually-inspired text that one meditates on, during an extended period of time set aside for meditation, as compared to a mantram (or mantra).
Easwaran collected an anthology of selections from the world's spiritual texts, God Makes the Rivers to Flow, for use in meditation.
Repetition of a mantram.
Easwaran describes a mantram as a short, powerful spiritual formula which can be repeated, at any time during the day or night, to call up the best and deepest in ourselves, and help to slow down, to become more one-pointed, and to put others first.
Slowing Down is an important spiritual discipline.
Living faster and faster gives no time for inner reflection or sensitivity to others, making our lives tense, insecure, inefficient, and superficial.
Slowing down helps achieve freedom of action, good relations with others, health and vitality, calmness of mind, and the ability to grow.
One-pointed attention helps to unify consciousness and deepen concentration.
Training the mind to give full attention to one thing at a time, whether it is in science or the arts or sports or a profession, is a basic requirement for achieving a goal.
Training the senses means freeing the mind from the tyranny of likes and dislikes so as to "live in freedom", "live intentionally" 
Putting others first.
Dwelling on ourselves builds a wall between ourselves and others.
Those who keep thinking about their needs, their wants, their plans, their ideas, cannot help becoming lonely and insecure.
As human beings, it is our nature to be part of a whole, to live in a context where personal relationships are supportive and close.
Spiritual Fellowship with people whose companionship is elevating, and working together for a selfless goal without expecting any reward or recognition, augment and enhance the individual's capacities.
Easwaran says that the eight points, though they may at first seem unrelated, are closely linked.
"Quieting your mind in morning meditation, for instance, will help your efforts to slow down at work, and slowing down at work will, in turn, improve your meditation ...
Unless you practice all of them, you cannot progress safely and far".
Passage Meditation does not require adherence to any particular religion or belief.
Questions and Answers.
The fourth edition (published in 2016) also contains about 80 pages dedicated to answering numerous questions about how to practice the program.
Influence, research, use.
Workers in professional fields, as well as writers of popular books, have cited or been influenced by the passage meditation program.
Sometimes, the passage meditation program has been included among resources for complementary and alternative medicine.
Several empirical research studies have examined the effects on health professionals and college undergraduates from receiving training in the Passage Meditation (PM) program.
Peer-reviewed research, published in professional psychology and health journals, has shown that following the passage meditation program reduces stress and increases confidence in tasks such as caregiving 
These studies mostly used randomized methods.
Like much recent research on meditation (e.g., on mindfulness meditation), research studies on Passage Meditation have neither postulated nor claimed to infer the operation of supernatural or other non-natural, non-psychological processes.
Research on Passage Meditation through early 2007 was reviewed in chapter 6 of "Spirit, science and health: How the spiritual mind fuels physical wellness".
In "Neurology Now", published by the American Academy of Neurology, the article "Meditation as Medicine" states that various well-designed studies show that meditation can increase attention span, sharpen focus, improve memory, and dull the perception of pain, and lists Passage Meditation as a common meditation method.
Passage Meditation has sometimes been integrated into college curricula.
Editions.
In 2001, "Publishers Weekly" reported that the book "Meditation" (later republished in as "Passage Meditation") had "sold more than 200,000 copies since its 1978 debut."
English editions have been published in the US, the UK, and India.
Non-English translations of the book have been published in Bulgarian, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Hungarian, Korean, Lithuanian, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovenian, Spanish, and Telugu, 
The four US editions are: 
English-language editions have been published in the United Kingdom by Taylor &amp; Francis (1979, , , 237 pages) and in India by Penguin (1996, , , 237 pages), and Jaico (2008, , , 251 pages).
Jangama dhyana 
Jangama dhyana is a meditation technique which has been practiced by various sages over the centuries.
In recent times, this technique was widely taught in India and around the world by Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj, who experienced a spiritual vision in which the manifestation of 
a Jangama sage instructed him in this technique of meditation to achieve self-realization.
"Jangama" means 'eternal existence' and "dhyana" means 'meditation.'
Hence "Jangama dhyana" is 'Meditation on the Eternal Existence (of the Self).'
Today, the technique is taught by his direct disciple Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj, who carries the legacy and spiritual teachings of his guru Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj around the world.
Origins.
"Jangama dhyana" is an ancient meditation technique which involves concentrating the mind and sight between the eyebrows.
According to Patanjali, this is one method of achieving the initial concentration ("dharana": Yoga Sutras, III: 1) necessary for the mind to go introverted in meditation ("dhyana": Yoga Sutras, III: 2).
In the deeper practice of the Jangama dhyana technique, the mind concentrated between the eyebrows begins to automatically lose all location and focus on the watching itself.
Eventually, the meditator experiences only the consciousness of existence and achieves Self Realization.
Swami Vivekananda describes the process in the following way: 
When the mind has been trained to remain fixed on a certain internal or external location, there comes to it the power of flowing in an unbroken current, as it were, towards that point.
This state is called "dhyana".
When one has so intensified the power of "dhyana" as to be able to reject the external part of perception and remain meditating only on the internal part, the meaning, that state is called "Samadhi".
The point between the eyebrows is referred to as the "bhrikuti" and symbolically as the "ajna chakra", which means 'commanding circle.'
When the mind becomes totally concentrated at this point, one becomes the commander of one's mind.
Until then, the meditator will not have achieved self-mastery.
The Bhagavad Gita describes the process and benefits of the meditation technique as follows: 
Shutting off sense  
From what is outward,  
Fixing the gaze  
At the root of the eye-brows,  
Checking the breath-stream  
In and outgoing  
Within the nostrils,  
Holding the senses,  
Holding the intellect,  
Thrusts fear aside,  
Thrusts aside anger  
And puts off desire:  
Truly that man  
Is made free for ever.
In modern times, the 19th century Yogi, Shri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, practiced meditating between the eyebrows in order to achieve "Nirvikalpa Samadhi" (bringing the mind to a complete standstill, beyond imagination).
Though he was able to withdraw his mind from all external sensations and objects, he initially could not go beyond the vision of goddess Kali, which his mind had become totally concentrated upon during his long period of devotional "tapas".
Shri Ramakrishna recounts how his Guru on the path of Advaita Vedanta, Totapuri, gave him further instruction in the meditation technique to overcome this obstacle: 
He cast his eyes around.
Finding a piece of glass he took it up and stuck it between my eyebrows...
'Concentrate the mind on this point!' he thundered.
Then with stern determination I again sat to meditate...
The last barrier fell.
My spirit at once soared beyond the relative plane and I lost myself in "Samadhi".
Later Shri Ramakrishna was to give the same instruction in meditation to his illustrious disciple Swami Vivekananda.
Today, the technique is associated with Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj and his direct disciple Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj.
Shri Shivabalayogi was initiated into the technique at the age of fourteen.
On 7 August 1949, he experienced a vision of a tall Jangama Sage (ancient order of ascetics) with matted hair, who told him to sit in padmasana (lotus posture), and close his eyes.
The Sage then touched the young boy between the eyebrows and instructed, 'Watch here.'
Thus, Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj sat in "tapas" (deep, prolonged meditation) for twelve years, meditating for 23 hours a day for eight years and around 12 hours a day for the remaining four years.
After this period, he initiated tens of thousands of people into the meditation technique he had used to achieve Self Realization.
In 1994, Shri Shivabalayogi initiated his direct disciple, Seenu, into "tapas" using the Jangama dhyana technique.
He achieved Self Realization in November 1999 and was given the name Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj, after meditating for around 20 hours a day over five years.
Name.
The name for the technique was coined by Shri Shivabalayogi while walking around the Dehradun ashram one night with his direct disciple, Seenu, who was later to become the Enlightened Yogi, Shri Shivarudra Balayogi.
He suddenly turned to Seenu and said: 
Perhaps it would be nice to name the meditation technique we are teaching worldwide as "Jangama dhyana."
Lord Shiva first appeared to me in the form of a Jangam Sage to impart the technique, and "Jangama" means 'Eternal Existence'; so "Jangama dhyana" would mean 'meditation on the Eternal Existence of the Self.'
Technique.
The Jangama dhyana technique is as follows: 
Sit, closing the eyes.
Concentrate the mind and sight in between eyebrows.
Keep watching there by focusing the attention.
Do not repeat any mantra or name.
Do not imagine anything.
Do not open eyes until the duration of meditation is over.
Today, initiation into this technique is given by Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj.
He identifies the greatest secret of meditation as not analyzing any thoughts or visions that may appear: 
This meditation is a purification process, but this purification doesn't occur quietly.
During the purification, visions and thoughts come.
It is just like when you are washing clothes; you see the dirt coming out into the water.
In the same way, when the mind is going through the purification, then thoughts and visions occur.
But they occur only for a moment, and then they disappear.
That is why we need to be so careful in this regard, because if you are watching, then the mind can very easily get involved in the thought, and if it gets involved it can further acquire new imprints.
This re-acquiring is so subtle.
This is why it is so important not to analyze thoughts during meditation, and this is also why the total cleansing of the mind takes time.
Visions and experiences are not important in meditation.
The only symptom of progress is greater peace.
After being totally cleansed through meditation, the mind becomes pure consciousness capable of realizing through deeper meditation ("Samadhi") its existence beyond imagination as the eternal Self.
This state is known as Self Realization or Enlightenment.
5Rhythms 
5Rhythms is a movement meditation practice devised by Gabrielle Roth in the late 1970s.
It draws from indigenous and world traditions using tenets of shamanistic, ecstatic, mystical and eastern philosophy.
It also draws from Gestalt therapy, the human potential movement and transpersonal psychology.
Fundamental to the practice is the idea that everything is energy, and moves in waves, patterns and rhythms.
Roth describes the practice as a soul journey, and says that by moving the body, releasing the heart, and freeing the mind, one can connect to the essence of the soul, the source of inspiration in which an individual has unlimited possibility and potential.
The practice.
The practice of the 5Rhythms is said by Gabrielle Roth to put the body in motion in order to still the mind.
The five rhythms (in order) are Flowing, Staccato, Chaos, Lyrical and Stillness.
The 5Rhythms, when danced in sequence, are known as a "Wave."
A typical Wave takes about an hour to dance.
Longer workshops may, according to "The Dancing Path", explore emotion, the cycle of life, the ego, relationships and spiritual vision.
The 5Rhythms Maps.
The work is taught through a series of maps that explore the terrain of the inner and outer worlds of individuals, their relationships to others and the space around them.
The maps offer a soul journey by exploring embodiment, emotions, the life cycle, the psyche, and the archetypes.
The rhythms offer understanding of people's innate powers – being, loving, knowing, seeing and healing.
The first map, "Waves" teaches embodiment of the five distinct rhythms.
To embody the rhythms means to access the deep internal wisdom that human bodies contain.
The "Heartbeat" map teaches how people have embodied and how they express the emotions of fear, anger, sadness, joy and compassion; while the "Cycles" map provides insight and understanding about how one has internalized conditioning and relationships throughout the life cycle, specifically in the stages of birth, childhood, puberty, maturity and death.
Insight and understanding of the ego is delivered through the psyche map, "Mirrors".
Roth drew a circular "Medicine Mandala" that related each rhythm to an emotion, a stage of life, a way of perceiving, and an aspect of the self.
Schools and teachers.
Roth founded "The Moving Center" in New York in 1977 as a base for her workshops, and to train and develop teachers. "5Rhythms Global" was founded in 2013 as the international Institute training 5Rhythms teachers worldwide.
The 5Rhythms Teachers Association was founded in 2007 as a professional association serving the continuing education of accredited 5Rhythms teachers.
The 5Rhythms movement spread worldwide, and in 2017 there were 396 certified teachers and SpaceHolders in 50+ countries.
5Rhythms teacher training is recognised by the International Conscious Movement Teachers Association (ICMTA), and graduates and teachers in training are eligible for membership in ICMTA.
Reception.
Charlotte Macleod, writing in the "London Evening Standard" in 2009, describes dancing the 5Rhythms as a kind of antidote to life in a large city, and how she was attracted to a dance class by a video of Thom Yorke.
The class leaves her "mentally and physically refreshed, and oddly connected to the other dancers."
The dance was "a kind of moving meditation" for her.
Christine Ottery, writing in "The Guardian" in 2011, states that "ecstatic dancing has an image problem" and "encompasses everything from large global movements such as 5Rhythms and Biodanza to local drum'n'dance meet-ups".
She suggests that readers may "find 5 Rhythms a good place to start", and does so herself: "Nervously, I stretch and warm my muscles.
As the rhythms take off, I shake off my shyness."
She dances in different ways, alone or with partners.
"My body is expressing itself - it's utter abandonment and a complete high."
Jed Lipinski, writing in "The New York Times" in 2010, notes that 5Rhythms is suitable for all ages, unlike some other forms of dance and movement.
He observes that "At a recent 5Rhythms class ... in Manhattan, more than 100 people were gleefully writhing and leaping to tribal drumming courtesy of Ms. Roth's husband, Robert Ansell...
Dancers occasionally released guttural howls, as if exorcising the demons of the workweek."
"The Daily Telegraph" writes of 5Rhythms in 2007 that "I love it precisely because it isn't based on learned steps.
Instead, the idea is to find your own dance by moving your body in whatever way you fancy.
For those of us keen to improve our fitness, it can also be an energetic aerobic workout."
Research.
Academics working in mental health and other fields are starting to carry out research about the 5Rhythms.
The Mental Health Foundation, a UK charity published the 'Dancing for Living Report' describing a group of women's experience of 5Rhythms dance and the effects on their emotional wellbeing.
The 5Rhythms have been the subject of PhD theses.
Hare Krishna (mantra) 
The Hare Krishna mantra, also referred to reverentially as the ("Great Mantra"), is a 16-word Vaishnava mantra which is mentioned in the Kali-Santarana Upanishad and which from the 15th century rose to importance in the Bhakti movement following the teachings of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.
This mantra is composed of three Sanskrit names – "Krishna", "Rama", and "Hare".
Since the 1960s, the mantra has been made well known outside India by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada and his movement, International Society for Krishna Consciousness (commonly known as the "Hare Krishnas" or the Hare Krishna movement).
Mantra.
The Hare Krishna mantra is composed of Sanskrit names: "Hare", "Krishna," and "Rama" (in Anglicized spelling).
It is a poetic stanza in meter (a quatrain of four lines () of eight syllables with certain syllable lengths for some of the syllables).
The mantra as rendered in the oldest extant written source, the Kali-Saṇṭāraṇa Upaniṣad, is as follows: 
When followers of Sri Krishna Chaitanya Mahaprabhu teach and practice the Mahamantra, it is rendered with the name Krishna first.
So the followers of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu read it as  
Pronunciation of mantra in IPA (Sanskrit): 
This mantra has multiple interpretations, all of which may be considered as correct.
"Hare" can be interpreted as the vocative form of "Hari", another name of Vishnu meaning "he who removes illusion".
Another interpretation is as the vocative of , a name of Rādhā, Krishna's eternal consort or his energy (Krishna's ).
According to A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, refers to "the energy/shakti of Supreme Personality of Godhead" while "Krishna" and "Rama" refer to Supreme Godhead himself, meaning "He who is All-Attractive" and "He who is the Source of All Pleasure".
In the hymn spoken by Bhishma in praise of Krishna after the Kurukshetra War, Krishna is also called "Rama".
It is sometimes believed that "Rama" in "Hare Rama" means "Radharamana" or the beloved of Radha (another name for Kṛṣṇa).
The more common interpretation is that Rāma refers to Rama of the Ramayana, an earlier avatar of Krishna.
"Rama can also be a shortened form of Balarama, Krishna's first expansion."
The mantra is repeated, either sung out loud (bhajan), congregationally (kirtan), or to oneself aloud or mentally on prayer beads made of Tulasi (japa).
A.
C.
Bhaktivedanta Swami describes the process of chanting the Maha Mantra as follows: 
History.
The mantra is first attested in the (Kali Santarana Upanishads), an Upanishad, which is commented on by Raghunandan Bhattacharya in his work .
In this Upanishad, Narada is instructed by Brahma (in the translation of K. N. Aiyar): 
Narada asks to be told this name of Narayana, and Brahma replies: 
Emic tradition claims that the mantra was popularized by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu roughly around 1500 A.D. when he began his mission to spread Harinam publicly to "every town and village" in the world, traveling throughout India, and especially within the areas of Bengal and Odisha.
Some versions of the Kali Santarana Upanishad give the mantra with "Hare Rama" preceding "Hare Krishna" (as quoted above), and others with "Hare Krishna" preceding "Hare Rama", as in Navadvipa version of the manuscript.
The latter format is by far the more common within the Vaishnava traditions.
It is a common belief that the mantra is equally potent when spoken in either order.
A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, a devotee of Krishna in disciplic succession, on the order of his guru, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, brought the teachings of Sri Chaitanya from Bharat (India) and single-handedly took the responsibility of spreading them around the Western world.
Beginning in New York City 1965, he encircled the globe fourteen times in the final eleven years of his life, thus making 'Hare Krishna' a well-known phrase in many parts of the world.
Popular culture.
The Hare Krishna mantra appears in a number of famous songs, notably those of George Harrison.
His first solo single "My Sweet Lord" topped charts around the world in 1970–71.
Harrison put a Hare Krishna sticker on the back of the headstock of Eric Clapton's 1964 Gibson ES-335; the sticker also appears on Gibson's 2005 reproduction of the guitar.
Produced by Harrison, Radha Krishna Temple's recording "Hare Krishna Mantra" was issued as a single on the Beatles' Apple record label in 1969.
The single was a commercial success, peaking at number 12 in the UK, and led to the Temple devotees appearing on the popular British music chart television programme "Top of the Pops".
The Broadway musical "Hair" has a song, "Hare Krishna", containing the mantra, along with some additional lyrics.
The mantra also prominently appears in Jesus Loves You's "Bow Down Mister" (1990) and in the Pretenders' "Boots of Chinese Plastic" from their 2008 album, "Break Up the Concrete".
Stevie Wonder used the devotees chanting Hare Krishna in his song "Pastime Paradise".
Less well-known recordings of the Hare Krishna mantra include versions by the Fugs on their 1968 album Tenderness Junction (featuring poet Allen Ginsberg), by Nina Hagen, in multiple songs by English psychedelic rock band Quintessence (produced by John Barham, a frequent collaborator of George Harrison) and by Hüsker Dü on their 1984 album "Zen Arcade".
Kula Shaker, Boy George, and members of the Rubettes have recorded music tracks about Krishna Consciousness.
In a 2010 experimental study involving both devotees and non-devotees, singing vowels like "ah" and "eh" was found to be more joyful than singing vowels like "oh" and "uh", possibly due to a facial feedback effect.
Scriptural references.
The practice of chanting the Hare Krishna mantra is recommended in the Puranas, the Pancharatra, and throughout Vaishnava literature in general.
For example: 
Zuowang 
Zuowang () is a classic Daoist meditation technique, described as "a state of deep trance or intense absorption, during which no trace of ego-identity is felt and only the underlying cosmic current of the Dao is perceived as real."
According to Louis Komjathy, this is one term for Daoist "apophatic" meditation, which also goes by various other names in Daoist literature, such as "quiet sitting" (靜坐 "jìngzuò"), "guarding the one" (守一 "shǒuyī"), "fasting the heartmind" (心齋 "xīnzhāi"), and "embracing simplicity" (抱朴 "bàopǔ").
Zuowang instructions can be seen in classic Taoist texts from as early as the Chinese Warring States Period, such as the "Zhuangzi".
The term also appears in the title of an influential manual from the Tang dynasty (618–907), the "Zuowanglun", and continues to inform Daoist contemplative practice today.
Terminology.
Chinese "zuòwàng" compounds the words "zuò" 坐 "sit; take a seat" and "wàng" 忘 "forget; overlook; neglect".
In terms of Chinese character classification, this "zuò" character 坐 is an ideogrammatic compound with two 人 "people" sitting on the 土 "ground"; and "wàng" 忘 is a phono-semantic compound with the "heart-mind radical" semantic element and a "wáng" 亡 "lose; disappear; flee; die; escape" phonetic and semantic element.
"Wáng" 亡 and "wàng" 忘 are etymologically cognate, explained as "(Mentally lost:) absent-minded, forget" (Karlgren, or "'to lose' (from memory)" 
Accurately translating "zuòwàng" is problematic.
Compare the remarkable similarities among dictionary translation equivalents.
Kohn explains translating "wàng" as "oblivion".
"Zuowang" 坐忘 "sitting in oblivion," signifies a state of deep meditative absorption and mystical oneness, during which all sensory and conscious faculties are overcome and which is the base point for attaining Dao.
I translate "wang" as "oblivion" and "oblivious" rather than "forgetting" or "forgetful" because the connotation of "forget" in English is that one "should" remember but doesn't do so, or—if used intentionally—that one actively and intentionally does something in the mind.
None of these holds true for what ancient and medieval Daoists were about.
This is borne out both by the language and the writings: the word "wang" in Chinese consists of the character "xin" for "mind-heart", usually associated with conscious and emotional reactions to reality and the word "wang" for "obliterate" or "perish".
The implication is – as indeed described in the sources – that one lets go of all kinds of intentional and reactive patterns and comes to rest in oneness with spirit and is ready to merge completely with Dao.
The synonyms "yíwàng" 遺忘 and "wàngquè" 忘卻 mean "forget; oblivion".
Daoist "zuòwàng" meditation had parallels in other Chinese religions and philosophies.
The practice of "jingzuo" 靜坐 "quiet sitting" was first recorded in the (third century BCE) Legalist classic "Hanfeizi".
Neo-Confucian leaders like Zhu Xi (1130-1200) and Wang Yangming (1472–1529) advocated "jingzuo" meditation.
("Jingzuo shiwei" 静坐示威 is the modern Chinese word for "sit-in").
The Chinese Buddhist practice of "zuochan" 坐禪 "sitting meditation" (namely, Japanese "zazen") uses the word "chan" "meditation; abstraction; trance", and "zuosi" 坐思 "sitting contemplation" uses "si" "think; consider; deliberate".
Compare the Buddhist word "zuowang" 坐亡 "sitting death; passing away while sitting in meditation", which is the ideal manner of death for eminent monks and nuns.
Classical usages.
Chinese classics first used "zuowang" "sitting forgetting" around the third century BCE, during the late Warring States period.
Zhuangzi.
The Daoist "Zhuangzi" had the earliest recorded reference to "zuowang".
One of the (c. 3rd century BCE) core "Zhuangzi", "Inner Chapters" (6, 大宗師) mentions "zuowang" "sitting forgetting" meditation in a famous dialogue between Confucius and his favorite disciple Yan Hui, who "ironically "turns the tables" on his master by teaching "him" how to "sit and forget".
Yan Hui describes forgetting the basic virtues of Confucianism: "li" "rites; ritual; morals", "yue" 樂 "music" (see "Classic of Music"), "ren" "benevolence; human-heartedness; altruism", and "yi" "justice; righteousness; significance" (compare the "Daodejing" 18).
"I'm making progress," said Yen Hui.&lt;br&gt; 
"What do you mean?"
asked Confucius. &lt;br&gt; 
"I have forgotten rites and music."
&lt;br&gt; 
"Not bad, but you still haven't got it."
&lt;br&gt; 
Yen Hui saw Confucius again on another day and said, "I'm making progress."
&lt;br&gt; 
"What do you mean?"
&lt;br&gt; 
"I have forgotten humaneness and righteousness."
&lt;br&gt; 
"Not bad, but you still haven't got it."
&lt;br&gt; 
Yen Hui saw Confucius again on another day and said, "I'm making progress."
&lt;br&gt; 
"What do you mean?"
&lt;br&gt; 
"I sit and forget."
&lt;br&gt; 
"What do you mean, 'sit and forget'?"
Confucius asked with surprise. &lt;br&gt; 
"I slough off my limbs and trunk," said Yen Hui, "dim my intelligence, depart from my form, leave knowledge behind, and become identical with the Transformational Thoroughfare.
This is what I mean by 'sit and forget'."
&lt;br&gt; 
"If you are identical," said Confucius, "then you have no preferences.
If you are transformed, then you have no more constants.
It's you who is really the worthy one!
Please permit me to follow after you."
Compare the above "Zhuangzi" translation by Victor H. Mair with the following.
Another passage which discusses the recovery or attainment of oblivion is one which describes the progress of Buliang Yi卜梁倚 under the guidance of Nüyu 女偊 (Female Hunchback): After three days, he was able to put the world outside himself Once he could do this, I continued my support and after seven days, he was able to put beings outside himself.
Once he could do this, I continued my support, and after nine days, he was able to put life outside himself.
Once he could do this, he achieved the brightness of dawn, and after this, he could see his own aloneness.
After he had managed to see his own aloneness, he could do away with past and present, and after that, he was able to enter [a state of] no life and no death.Apophatic meditation practice can also be seen in the following Zhuangzhi passages which speak of "fasting the heartmind":"You must fast!
I will tell you what that means.
Do you think that it is easy to do anything while you have a heart-mind?
If you do, the luminous cosmos will not support you...Make your aspirations one!
Don't listen with your ears; listen with your heart-mind.
No, don't listen with your heart-mind; listen with qi. 8 Listening stops with the ears, the heart-mind stops with joining, but qi is empty and waits on all things.
The Dao gathers in emptiness alone.
Emptiness is the fasting of the heart-mind."I always fast in order to quiet my mind.
When I have fasted for three days, I no longer have any thought of congratulations or rewards, of titles or stipends.
When I have fasted for five days, I no longer have any thought of praise or blame, of skill or clumsiness.
When I have fasted for seven days, I am so still that I forget I have four limbs and a body-form or structure.
By that time, the ruler and his court no longer exist for me.
My skill is concentrated and all outside distractions fade away.
Interpretation.
Roth refers to the apophatic practice of Daoist breath meditation as "inner cultivation", evident in Yan Hui meaning: "to lose visceral awareness of the emotions and desires, which, for the early Daoists, have "physiological" bases in the various organs", "to deliberately cut off sense perception", and "to lose bodily awareness and remove all thoughts from consciousness."
Kohn says, "This passage presents a mental state of complete unknowing, of loss of personal identity and self, and a kind of total immersion in the Non-being of the universe."
The "Zhuangzi" has other allusions to meditation.
Yan Hui asks Confucius about "xinzhai" 心齋 "fasting of the mind" (4), and two chapters discuss the question "Can you really make your body become like a withered carcass and your mind like dead ashes?"
(2, 24).
Harold Oshima clarifies that for Zhuangzi, "forgetting" means to empty the "xin" "heart; mind", "just as one empties one's stomach by fasting.
This idea of "forgetting" is essential, frequently cited as the most important hurdle in the quest for sagehood.
It does not refer, however, to the simple displacing of facts from the mind."
The Xuanxue (lit.
"Arcane Learning") "Neo-Daoist" philosopher Guo Xiang (d. 312 CE) redacted the "Zhuangzi" text, and wrote a commentary, which explains "zuowang".
In a state of sitting in oblivion, what could there be unforgotten?
First one forgets all outer manifestations ("ji" 迹), then one also forgets that which causes the manifestations.
On the inside, one is unaware that there is a self ("shen" 身), on the outside one never knows that there is heaven and earth.
Thus one becomes utterly empty and can unite with the changes, leaving nothing unpervaded.
Guo refers to the Xuanxue philosophical distinction between "ben" 本 "root" (Daoist underlying ground of Being) and "ji" "traces" (apparent Confucian virtues), "as everything is a trace of the Ultimate Truth, neither real because is not the Truth, nor false because it is its manifestation".
In addition, "Guo Xiang interprets the attained state of oneness as one of going along with the changes, adding an ecstatic element of transformation to the basically enstatic notion of oblivion".
The translators render "datong" 大通 as "Great Pervader", "the Infinite", "Great/ universal/Transformational Thoroughfare", and "Tao".
Mair explains that "Transformational Thoroughfare" follows the "Huainanzi" graphic variant (or copyist's error) of "hua" 化 "transform; change; convert" for 大 "big; great".
According to Kohn, oblivion and the goal of "zuowang" is associated with "Hundun" 混沌, "Chaos", the primordial and cosmic root of creation which is one with Dao.
A figure associated with Chaos, Vast Concealment ("Hongmeng" 鴻蒙) teaches the following meditation instructions in the Zhuangzi, which is termed "mind nourishing" ("xinyang" 心養):Just take the position of nonaction and all things unfold naturally.
Let your body and limbs fall away, expel perception and intellect, leave relations and things behind in oblivion.
Become mystically one with the immense and boundless, release your mind and free your spirit.
Be silent and without an active spirit soul [that interacts with the world], and the ten thousand things will each return to their root.
Each return to their root and rest in unknowing—dark, obscure, chaotic: they remain like this for the rest of their days.
However, the moment you try to know this state, you have already effected a separation from it.
Don't ask its name, don't measure its foundation—it's the spontaneous life of each being.Guo Xiang comments that "zuowang" is a practice which allows one to recover the primordial cosmic state which has been lost during human development.
He calls this first state "Chaos Complete" ("huncheng" 混成) and says: This means being oblivious of Heaven and Earth, doing away with beings.
On the outside not examining time and space, on the inside never conscious of one's body-self.
Thus one can be boundless and unattached, going along with beings and fully according with all.The Tang dynasty Daoist scholar Cheng Xuanying 成玄英 (fl. 631-650) wrote a "Zhuangzi" commentary, linking "zuowang" to "jianwang" 兼忘 "twofold forgetfulness", based upon the abstruse two-truths theory of Chinese Buddhist monk Jizang (549-623).
Kohn explains, "First one forgets the outer reality (Being), then one forgets its underlying ground (Non-being).
Once beyond these two, one reaches a state of both Being and Non-being, which, once again obliterated, becomes one of neither Being nor Non-being, a state of perception that neither accepts nor negates, and is sensorially aware yet utterly pure."
Dao De Jing.
Some passages from the Dao De Jing give further support and context to the practice of Daoist apophatic meditation.
Chapter 12 states that one should control the senses since overindulgence leads to loss: "The five colors will cause the eyes to go blind, the five tones will cause the ears to be deaf, the five flavors will cause the palate to be spoiled".
The practitioner is also said to leave the outside world behind them: "Cut off contacts, shut the doors, and to the end of life there will be peace without toil" (ch. 52, 56), it likewise says one should "abandon learning" and be "like an infant".
The practice is said to be one of "decreasing and again decreasing" (ch. 48).
The Tao Te Ching also notes that the sense of self and body is the source of our vexations: "The body-self is the reason why I have terrible vexations.
If I did not have a body-self, what trouble would I have?"
(ch. 13).
Through this practice one can return to the Dao: "All things flourish, but each returns to its root.
This return to the root means stillness, it is called recovering original destiny.
Recovering original destiny is called the eternal, and to know the eternal is called brightness" (ch. 16).
Neiye.
The "Neiye" 內業 (In- ward Training) is another important source for the early practice of Daoist sitting meditation.
It appears as part of the "Xinshu" 心術 (the Techniques of the Heart-mind), chapters of the Guanzi.
It describes a method leading to oblivion/forgetfulness which is based on alignment of the body and its Qi (subtle breath).
This text describes the practice of refining one's Qi through preparatory practices like moderation in diet, withdrawal from sense stimulation, and proper physical posture.
It discusses a contemplative process involving a "fourfold alignment": 1.
Aligning the body ("zhengxing" 正形) 2.
Aligning the four limbs ("zheng siti" 正四體): "Four limbs firm and fixed" 3.
Aligning the qi ("zhengqi" 正氣) 4.
Aligning the heart-mind ("zhengxin" 正心).
Through an upright posture and deep breaths, one creates a sense of quiet within and a well ordered mind, which allows for Qi to develop and their mind to become clear and serene.
Huainanzi.
The (c. 139 BCE) philosophical compendium "Huainanzi" includes another version of the anecdote about Yan Hui explaining "zuowang" to his teacher Confucius.
"I am making progress," said Yan Hui.&lt;br&gt; 
"What do you mean?"
asked Confucius. &lt;br&gt; 
"I have forgotten Rites and Music."
&lt;br&gt; 
"Not bad, but you still haven't got it."
&lt;br&gt; 
Yan Hui saw Confucius on another day and said, "I am making progress."
&lt;br&gt; 
"What do you mean?"
&lt;br&gt; 
"l have forgotten Humaneness and Rightness."
&lt;br&gt; 
"Not bad, but you still haven't got it."
&lt;br&gt; 
Yan Hui saw Confucius again on another day and said, "I sit and forget."
&lt;br&gt; 
"What do you mean 'sit and forget'?"
Confucius asked with surprise. &lt;br&gt; 
"I slough off my limbs and trunk," said Yan Hui, "dim my intelligence, depart from my form, leave knowledge behind, and immerse myself in the conduits of transformation.
This is what I mean by 'sit and forget'."
&lt;br&gt; 
"If you are immersed," said Confucius, "then you have no preferences.
If you are transformed, then you have no more constants.
It is you who is really the worthy one!
Please permit me to follow after you."
&lt;br&gt; 
Therefore the "Laozi" says: &lt;br&gt; 
"When nourishing your ethereal soul and embracing the One –&lt;br&gt; 
can you not let them go?&lt;br&gt; 
In concentrating your "qi" and attaining softness, &lt;br&gt; 
can you be like an infant?"
(12)  
The "Huainanzi" version appends a "Daodejing" (10) quotation, which is not found in the "Zhuangzi".
Besides some minor differences – such as exchanging "li" and "yue" with "ren" and "yi", and writing "huatong" "Transformational Thoroughfare" for "datong" "Great Thoroughfare" – these two versions are conspicuously similar.
Major et al caution against concluding that the "Huainanzi" compilers drew upon the "Zhuangzi".
Roth suggests that the received "Zhuangzi" text may have been compiled, along with the "Huainanzi", at the Huainan court of Liu An.
Tang dynasty.
According to Livia Kohn, further development of the practice of "zuowang" occurred during the Tang dynasty, when Daoists of the Twofold Mystery (Chongxuan 重玄) and Highest Clarity (Shangqing 上清) schools wrote texts which discuss oblivion/forgetfulness.
The treatises of this period, are more complex and detailed, with philosophical argumentation which includes Buddhist concepts as well as additions to the practice, like visualizations.
Zuowanglun tradition.
The Shangqing School (上清, Supreme Clarity) began during the Western Jin dynasty, and their texts are also a source for the practice of "zuowang".
The most influential "zuowang" text of this tradition is Sima Chengzhen's (647–735) "Zuowanglun" 坐忘論 ("Essay on Sitting and Forgetting", DZ 1036).
This text was very influential and according to Kohn, was central to a Daoist school of meditation associated with Sima Chengzhen and located in the Tiantai range.
This tradition was also influenced by Buddhist meditation as practiced in the Tiantai school.
The text has survived in two editions: one in Zhang Junfang's "Yunji Qiqian" 雲笈七籤 and Xu Song's "Quan Tangwen" 全唐文, and another in the "Daozang".
A shorter "Zuowanglun" copy was inscribed on a stele erected on Mount Wangwu in 829.
Other relevant texts from Tang Dynasty masters (such as Sun Simiao and Wu Yun) associated with the Zuowanglun tradition include the "Dingguan jing" 定觀經 (Scripture on Stability and Observation, DZ 400), the "Cunshen lianqi ming" 存神鍊氣 銘 (Inscription on Visualizing Spirit and Refining Qi, DZ 834), the "Neiguan jing" 內觀經 (Scripture of Inner Observation, DZ 641) and the "Tianyinzi" 天隱子 (Book of the Master of Heavenly Seclusion, DZ 1026).
According to Kohn, The "Tianyizi" was widely published, and is still used among qigong practitioners today.
According to Kohn, the Zuowanglun outlines seven steps in the progress of "zuowang" meditation: 
As Kohn notes, the texts of this tradition make it clear that the progress through these stages happens gradually.
Twofold Mystery and Northern celestial masters.
One influential text from this period is the "Xisheng jing," a text associated with the Daoist monastery of Louguan, a center of the Northern Celestial Masters located in the Zhongnan mountains.
This work is widely cited and commented upon and describes meditation in terms of "reaching emptiness and nonbeing, peace and tranquility".
In his commentary on the Xinsheng Jing, Wei Jie states:The more advanced religious practice leading toward Dao is meditation.
The practitioner concentrates his internal qi and visualizes the body divinities.
Sensory impressions cease.
Cravings for outer things diminish.
The result is complete oblivion.
On the outside become oblivious of all seeing and hearing and in due course all desires to see and hear will cease.
On the inside become completely oblivious of thinking and tasting, and in due course all craving for language and food will end.
When all without and within has ceased, one can be serene and obscure.
In such a state one will return to the state when there were no beings.
On "zuowang", Twofold mystery commentator Cheng Xuanying's states:Even though auditory perception belongs to the ears and visual power is a function of the eyes, they ultimately depend on the mind.
Once one has awakened to the fact that the body does not really exist, that the myriad states of the mind are empty, then one can smash up one's body, drive out intellect and do away with understanding.According to Livia Kohn:Twofold Mystery thus envisions the mystical process in two steps, described as double forgetting (jianwang 兼忘).
Practitioners must first discard all concepts of being, then proceed to discard all ideas of nonbeing.
These two are, moreover, identified as mental projections (jing 境), i.e., illusory mental imaginations that are projected outward and create an apparent reality of "being;" and active wisdom (zhi 智) or mind as such (xin 心), the inherent function of active consciousness which signifies "nonbeing".
"Forgetting" both means the reorganization of ordinary consciousness to absolute consciousness and again from absolute consciousness to no consciousness at all in complete oblivion.
Yet the sagely state is not nothingness but the "embodiment of the Dao of Middle Oneness," a state of radiance and surging activity.Furthermore, Kohn states that this tradition was influenced by Buddhist Madhyamaka thought and meditative praxis.
The "Daojiao yishu" 道教義樞 (The Pivotal Meaning of Daoist Teaching, DZ 1129) for example, adopts and integrates many Buddhist ideas.
In this work, "zuowang" is listed as one of several meditative practices, which include meditation on deities and inhaling Qi.
The "Daojiao yishu" makes use of Buddhist Madhyamaka analysis and Daoist apophasis in its explication of meditative progress.
It breaks down the sense of self identity in terms of the Buddhist five aggregates and then goes on to analyze the "emptiness" of real and apparent dharmas [phenomena].
Later works from the Twofold Mystery tradition continued to develop the theory and practice of sitting in forgetfulness.
For example, the "Sanlun yuan-zhi" 三論元旨 (Primordial Pointers of the Three Theories, DZ 1039) describes a sequence of meditative progress beginning with purity (cheng 澄), followed by quietude (jing 靜), oblivion (wang 忘), enlightenment (ming 明), open pervasion (da 達) and finally to realizing awakening and completing perfection (liaowu chengzhen 了悟成真).
Medieval Daoism and Quanzhen school.
During the Song dynasty (960–1279), few passages used the term "zuowang," and Daoist meditation texts shift in focus on what it means to attain the Dao.
Song dynasty Daoist traditions emphasized ecstatic excursions to other worlds to commune with deities and internal alchemy transformations while using "zuowang" to indicate preparatory or secondary meditation practices.
Song Internal alchemy texts also see "zuowang" as a supportive practice and interpret it in Buddhist terms comparable to sitting in absorption (zuochan 坐禪).
One later Daoist tradition which practiced similar forms of apophatic meditation was the Quanzhen (Complete Perfection) school, which remains to this day a major Daoist school in China.
Quanzhen was founded by Wang Chongyang (1113–1170) and his direct disciples.
A central practice of this tradition is the cultivation of clarity and purity by being of no mind and no thoughts and not being attached to anything, this allows one to recover the primordial and deathless 'Real Nature' that humans have lost in their worldly concerns.
Practicing "seated meditation" (dazuo 打坐), "quiet sitting" (jingzuo 靜坐), "sitting cross-legged" (jiafu zuo 跏趺坐), or "aligned sitting" (zhengzuo 正坐) was also a very important practice for the Quanzhen school, for which isolation and seclusion was also paramount.
The three main types of sitting meditation in this tradition are Cultivating clarity and stillness (qingjing 清靜), Inner observation (neiguan 內觀), and Internal alchemy (neidan 內丹).
In its practice of mental training, which focuses on stabilizing or settling the heartmind, Quanzhen took some inspiration from Chan Buddhism and taught that one must be aware during all of one's situations and life activities.
This can be seen in the following passage of Wang Chongyang:Now, to "have a sit" (dazuo, to practice meditation) does not refer to the act of assuming the proper posture and closing the eyes.
Such is but false sitting.
[To practice] true sitting you must throughout the twelve [double-] hours, whether staying, going, sitting, or lying, throughout all your motion and stillness, make your mind be like Mt. Tai—unmoving and unwavering.
Grasp and cut off the four gates of your eyes, ears, mouth, and nose.
Do not allow outer scenery to enter in.
If there is any stirring of thought even the size of a silk thread or a single fine fur, it cannot be called "quiet sitting."
One who is able to be like this already has his/her name recorded in the ranks of the immortals, even though his/her body resides in the dusty world.
He/she need not travel afar to consult another person.
In other words, the wise sage (the Real Nature with its intuitive wisdom) is in his/her very own body.
In a hundred years his/her merit will be full; shedding his/her shell, he/she ascends to Realization.
The single pill of cinnabar is completed, and his/her spirit wanders the eight surfaces.
Now, in speaking of the ways of the mind: Always serenely the mind is kept motionless.
Darkly, silently, you do not look at the myriad objects.
Dimly, murkily, without an inside nor an outside, you have no thoughts even the size of a silk thread or a single fine fur.
This is the stability of mind; it should not be subdued.
If you follow your surroundings and give rise to thoughts, stumbling and falling while seeking now the head and now the tail, this is called the disorderly mind.
You must cut it off immediately, and you must not follow its whims.
It damages and destroys your Tao-virtue and it diminishes your Nature and Life.
Whether staying, going, sitting, or lying down, you must diligently subdue it.
What you hear, see, know, and understand is but a disease and [an] ailment to you.Likewise, one of Wang's main disciples, Ma Yu, teaches:You should reform your misdeeds, but this is not [only] to be done through seated meditation.
You should keep your mind stable for a long time.
Going, staying, sitting, and lying down (i.e., all daily activities—a phrase common in Chan discourse) are the practice of the Tao.
Gentlemen, quit giving rise to thoughts!
Quickly seek out your Nature and Life.
If you can just clear your mind and abandon your desires, you will be a Divine Immortal.
Acknowledge nothing else and stop having doubts!
These are proper and true words.
You only need to be constantly clear and constantly pure.
Practice this diligently.Another similar meditation practice taught by Wang was based on focusing one's attention on the lower belly, an area known as the Ocean of Qi: "With your mind think of your spirit residing lengthily in your [Lower] Elixir Field, embracing and guarding the primal qi, without letting it get scattered and lost.
This is the Method of Embracing the One."
Modern interpretations.
Schools of East Asian Buddhism adopted "zuowang" practices, notably Chinese Chan, Japanese Zen, and Tibetan Dzogchen.
Through its practice, adepts eliminate all sensory perception and the conscious mind as inherently dualistic and potentially misleading, avoiding the use of the sensory apparatus in attaining higher states.
Practitioners thus strive to access what they call pure experience or "sitting in oblivion of everything" by letting go of all ordinary perception while strengthening intuition, the potency of the inborn, natural mind—a pure reflection of original cosmos in human beings.
Posture and body control become essential; all analytical, dualistic thinking as well as connection to deities are radically overcome.
Daoists today use "zuowang" to mean a specific form of practice involving loss of self and conscious thought.
Victor H. Mair, polymathic Professor of Chinese Language and Literature at the University of Pennsylvania, explains: 
"Tsowang" ("sit-forget") is the technical term in early Taoism for meditation.
It corresponds roughly to Buddhist "ch'an" (i.e., Zen, from Sanskrit "dhyāna") but more specifically to "samādhi" ("conjoining"), a trance state in which the mind loses itself in the object of contemplation.
This may be thought of as complete obliviousness.
There are numerous precise stages and states in Indian meditation.
In general, they may be described, in Patanjali's term, as various types of "citta-vṛtti-nirodha" ("mental-action-control").
The highest levels are the various types of trance ("śamana", "calming, pacification") in which the yogi becomes one with the universe and in which all trace of mental activity ceases.
Similar trance states are described in the "Chuang Tzu", although here the emphasis is less on the voiding ("śūnyatā") of the mind than it is on "bodilessness" ("videha") or exteriorization.
Liu Xingdi of the Leigutai Temple in Shaanxi says: 
"Zuowang" is allowing everything to slip from the mind, not dwelling on thoughts, allowing them to come and go, simply being at rest.
It is important to take a good posture to still the body and calm the mind.
Otherwise "qi" disperses, attention wanders, and the natural process is disturbed.
Just remain empty and there is no separation from Dao.
Then wisdom will arise and bring forth light, which is the clear "qi" of the person.
Do not think too much about the theory of this, otherwise you are sure to disturb the mind.
It is like the sun rising in the east and setting in the west.
To think about stopping it halfway is a futile exercise.
Just trust the inherent natural process.
Shi Jing, leader of the British Taoist Association, explains: 
"Zuowang" is to sit and forget.
What we forget is the thing we hold most dearly: self, with all its opinions, beliefs, and ideals.
We can be so caught up in the concept of self that we only see the world as a place to fulfill personal ambition and desire.
Eva Wong, author and Quanzhen practitioner, says: 
"Zuowang" is a dropping of conceptions.
When we drop conceptions, what we have is the natural emergence of the natural self, the natural celestial mind, which has been with us all the time.
It is only because of our conceptions that we can't experience it.
So when we practice "zuowang", we are simply saying that here is a method where we can begin to drop conceptions.Louis Komjathy, Daoist studies scholar and ordained Daoist priest states:Apophatic meditation focuses on emptiness and stillness.
It is contentless, non-conceptual, and non-dualistic.
One simply empties the heart-mind of all emotional and intellectual content...First, one withdraws from sensory engagement with the phenomenal world.
Then one empties the heart-mind of intellectual and emotional content.
Finally, one enters the state of cosmological integration, wherein qi, subtle breath or one's vital force, is the primary layer of being that one listens to.
This condition is described as "unity" (yi 一), "emptiness" (kong 空 or xu 虚), and "identification" (tong 同/通).
As the Dao is Stillness from the Daoist prospective, by entering one's own interior silence one returns to one's innate nature, which is the Dao.
Modern research.
Research on meditation has examined basic "zuowang" relaxation techniques such as deep breathing and attentional control, which Kohn says, "have a profound impact on human physiology and neurology, activating the parasympathetic nervous system and creating an inner state of receptivity and caIm."
Santee compares Herbert Benson's "Relaxation Response" with Daoist "zuowang" meditation practices.
Benson (2000:104-106) cites the classic "Zhuangzi" passage on Yan Hui's "zuowang" as an example of culturally diverse methods for evoking the relaxation response and reducing chronic stress.
The psychiatrist Charles E. Stroebel's "Quieting Reflex" also uses concentration for healing.
Kohn describes it as "somewhat closer to Daoist practice," notably the notion of "qi" circulating through meridians and organs.
The holistic psychologist John Diamond's "Behavioral Kinesiology" (1978), which is based upon the controversial applied kinesiology, involves social, physical, and psychological measures to enhance bodily well-being, which Kohn finds to be "very much in agreement with those described by Sun Simiao and Sima Chengzhen."
Livia Kohn concludes: 
To sum up, while many of the practices associated with oblivion as an integrated system are still present today—as much as "zuowang" itself is still practiced in Daoist communities—the focus for the most part has shifted toward the more immediate gratification of modern desires: stress release, pain control, healing, and enhanced success and well-being.
In addition, there are certain branches of modern science: such as kinesiology and energy medicine, that allow the integration of traditional Daoist views of body and mind into a contemporary scientific framework and are shaping current new developments.

Footnotes 
Zuowanglun 
The Zuowanglun or Zuowang lun is a Taoist meditative text that was written by the Shangqing School patriarch Sima Chengzhen (647–735).
Taoism incorporated many Buddhist practices during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), and the "Zuowanglun" combined meditation techniques from Taoism (e.g., 坐忘 "zuòwàng" "sitting forgetting", and 觀 "guān" "observation"), Buddhism ("śamatha" "calm abiding", and "vipaśyanā" "insight") and Confucian concept (正心誠意).
Author.
Sima Chengzhen (or Si-ma Ch'eng-chen) 司馬承禎 (647–735), also known as Daoyin 道隐 "Recluse of the Tao" and Baiyunzi 白雲子 "Master of the White Cloud", was a native of Henan.
He was a descendant of the Jin Dynasty (266–420) imperial house, and his family included many high-ranking scholar-officials.
Although Sima received a traditional education in the Confucian classics, he converted to Taoism, and was ordained by the Shangqing "Highest Clarity" School in 669.
Sima was promoted to Shangqing Grand Master in 684, and became a favorite of the imperial court and aristocracy.
Russell Kirkland (2008:911) describes Sima Chengzhen as "perhaps the most important Taoist of Tang times."
Textual versions.
There are two received "Zuowanglun" editions and a stone inscription on Mount Wangwu.
Received editions.
The "Zuowanglun" text exists in two main editions.
One is in Zhang Junfang's (1019) "Yunji Qiqian" 雲笈七籤 " 
Seven Cloudy Satchel" and Xu Song's (1819) "Quan Tangwen" 全唐文 "Complete Tang Literature".
Another is in the (1444) "Daozang" "Taoist Canon" and (1796–1820) "Daozang jiyao" 道藏輯要 "Essentials of the Taoist Canon".
There are two prefaces with the text, one by the author Sima Chengzhen and another by the otherwise unknown recluse Zhenjing (真靜).
Stele inscription.
A shorter "Zuowanglun" inscription on a stele, dated to the year 829, was placed in front of a temple dedicated to Sima Chengzhen erected in Jiyuan on Mount Wangwu, his last residence.
It summarizes the key features of the text.
Kohn says it "is probably an early forerunner", and translates this "Inscription on Oblivion".
Content.
The "Zuowanglun" elucidates seven steps, involving various practices, "including Buddhist-inspired concentration, observation, and absorption", that gradually lead one from ordinary consciousness to "dedao" 得道 "attaining the Dao; becoming enlightened".
The Zhenjing preface explains.
As the author's understanding and viewpoint are extraordinary indeed, he clarifies Dao very well.
First he leads the reader to feel "respect and faith" so that his mind may be no longer in mad confusion.
Then he makes him "break off his karmic conditions" and factors, "tame his mind," and "detach himself from affairs" so that he can be serene in his physical structure and illuminated within.
By the next step of "perfect observation" of center and periphery, being and nonbeing, he can then step into the "stability of cosmic peace," where the qi is peaceful and the spirit stable.
Thus it is called "attaining Dao."
Translations.
There are English translations of the "Zuowanglun" by Livia Kohn, Thomas Cleary., and Wu Jyh Cherng, that originally translated to Brazilian Portuguese .
The title is translated as: 
Kohn explains choosing "oblivion" instead of "forgetfulness".
I translate "wang" as "oblivion" and "oblivious" rather than "forgetting" or "forgetful" because the connotation of "forget" in English is that one "should" remember but doesn't do so, or – if used intentionally – that one actively and intentionally does something in the mind.
None of these holds true for what ancient and medieval Daoists were about.
This is borne out both by the language and the writings: the word "wang" in Chinese consists of the character "xin" for "mind-heart," usually associated with conscious and emotional reactions to reality and the word "wang" for "obliterate" or "perish."
The implication is – as indeed described in the sources – that one lets go of all kinds of intentional and reactive patterns and comes to rest in oneness with spirit and is ready to merge completely with Dao.
Related texts.
The "Zuowanglun" is associated with six contemporaneous texts by Daoist mediation masters from the "Chongxuan" 重玄 "Twofold Mystery" and Shangqing "Highest Clarity" Schools.
Sima Chengzhen led an influential school of Buddho-Daoist mediation centered on Mount Tiantai, which was also the headquarters of the Tiantai school of Buddhism.
The (early 8th century) "Dingguanjing" 定觀經 "Scripture on Concentration and Observation", or "Dongxuan lingbao dingguanjing" 洞玄靈寶定觀經 "Scripture on Concentration and Observation of the Numinous Treasure from the Cavern Mystery", appears three times in the Daoist Canon: as an appendix to the "Zuowanglun" edition, as a separate text (DZ 400), and in the "Yunji Qiqian" anthology.
This 49-stanza text outlines the psychological transition from an ordinary perspective with emotions and desires to a mental state of stability and quietude.
The popular "Dingguanjing" was summarized under the title "Guanmiaojing" 觀妙經 "Scripture on Concentration on the Mystery" (DZ 326).
The "Cunshen lianqiming" 存神鍊氣銘 "Inscription on Visualizing Spirit and Refining Qi" (DZ 834) is attributed to the Daoist physician and alchemist Sun Simiao (d. 682).
This text first records five phases in taming the mind and seven stages in transforming the body into immortality, which the "Zuowanglun" appendix and "Dingguanjing" repeat.
The "Tianyinzi" 天隱子 "[Book of the] Master of Heavenly Seclusion" was allegedly transmitted by Wu Yun 吳筠 (d. 778) and edited by Sima Chengzhen, who wrote the "Oral Instructions" postface.
This text is contained in the Daoist Canon (DZ 1026), and has been republished many times in non-Daoist collections.
The "Tianyinzi" emphasizes gradual progress toward the Dao through simplicity, fasting, seclusion, visualization, sitting in forgetfulness, and spirit liberation.
Present day "qigong" practitioners consider the "Tianyinzi" to be a core text.
The "Xinmulun" 心目論 "Treatise on Mind and Eyes", also by Wu Yun, is an imaginary dialogue between the heart-mind and eyes (DZ 1038).
The mind accuses the eyes (representing the senses) of causing confusion and agitation, but the eyes argue that the mind is ultimately responsible.
The mind resolves to eliminate thoughts with "zuowang" in order to achieve liberation.
Wu Yun uses various water metaphors (frequently written with the water radical 水 or 氵) to describe mental activities.
He emphasizes the distraught and unhappy state of mind with words like "luan"亂 "chaotic; confused" and "Iun" 淪 "engulfed; muddled"; and uses images like "cheng hundun" 乘混沌 "ride on pure chaos" and become one with the "hanman" 汗漫 "vast expanse of water" to express the mind's longing for clarity and freedom.
Abstract purity and defilement are also expressed in water-terms of "qing" 清 "clarity; standing water that is lucid to the bottom" and "zi" 滓 "dregs; sediments; defilements".
The (late 6th century) "Neiguanjing" 內觀經 "Scripture of Inner Observation" (DZ 641), is written in the words of Laozi (deified as Lord Lao 老君).
This treatise describes inner meditations on the human body, Buddho-Daoist psychological terms, and internal purification.
The "Wuchujing" 五廚經 "Scripture of the Five Kitchens" (DZ 763), was edited and annotated by Yin Yin 尹愔 and presented to the Tang court in 736.
This mystical poem is devoted to the Five "Zang" "Organs", with "Kitchens" figuratively meaning "qi" processing in "neidan" "internal alchemy".
The text is also transmitted in a Buddhist version.
Modern Daoists consider the "Wuchujing" as talismanic and chant it for protection.

Iasos (musician) 
Iasos (born January 9, 1947) is the stage name of a Greek-born American musician and composer who is considered a pioneer of new-age music.
His company Inter-Dimensional Music is based in Sausalito, California.
Iasos has performed and lectured internationally, and his music is distributed worldwide.
His music has been used by NASA and the Laserium light show.
Life and career.
At age four, Iasos and his family moved from Greece to the US, first settling in Malone, New York.
He began piano lessons when he was eight and the flute at age ten; he played the latter in his school band.
In June 1968, he graduated from Cornell University with a degree in cultural anthropology.
He performed in rock and smooth jazz bands during this time, including his group the Nova Shadow Quartet, which he said was "played in a sloppy unprofessional manner.
Nothing I would want to share publicly."
After he decided against a scholarship he relocated to California to pursue music further, first to Berkeley before settling in Marin County.
Iasos thought of his stage name as he was walking down a street.
He began working on music that he would internally "hear", describing it as "paradise music".
He considered classical composers Ottorino Respighi, Maurice Ravel, and Claude Debussy, pianist Martin Denny, and guitarist Jimi Hendrix as particular musical influences during this time.
Following his move to California, Iasos collaborated with other musicians for a short period but to no success, so he chose to become a solo artist.
It was then when "things got very far out very fast".
In the early 1970s, Iasos attended sessions with a spiritual teacher in Sausalito, who paired him with a spiritual being named Vista (or Cyclopea, named after the Elohim of the Fifth Ray).
Vista has been a source of inspiration and direction in Iasos's music ever since.
He recalled: "As soon as I felt his presence it was like remembering him from long ago, and there's this flood of love coming out from me to him."
In 1975, Iasos released his first album, "Inter-Dimensional Music".
It was in the same year that his friend and fellow musician Steven Halpern also released his debut, "Spectrum Suite".
The latter features Iasos playing the electric flute.
Both albums are now considered pioneers in the New-age music genre.
Reception.
In 1989, research conducted by Professor Joel Funk at Plymouth State University reported that of people who have had near-death experiences referred to the track "The Angels of Comfort" from Iasos's album "Angelic Music" (1978) as being closest to the music they heard during these experiences by a wide margin.
Buddhist philosopher Alan Watts has said "Iasos is doing the classical music of the New Age."
Guitarist Lee Underwood has said ""Angelic Music"...perhaps exemplif(ies) the best this genre has to offer."

Inner peace 
Inner peace (or peace of mind) refers to a deliberate state of psychological or spiritual calm despite the potential presence of stressors.
Being "at peace" is considered by many to be healthy (homeostasis) and the opposite of being stressed or anxious, and is considered to be a state where our mind performs at an optimal level with positive outcomes.
Peace of mind is thus generally associated with bliss, happiness and contentment.
Peace of mind, serenity, and calmness are descriptions of a disposition free from the effects of stress.
In some cultures, inner peace is considered a state of consciousness or enlightenment that may be cultivated by various forms of training, such as breathing exercises, prayer, meditation, tai chi or yoga, for example.
Many spiritual practices refer to this peace as an experience of knowing oneself.
People have difficulties embracing their inner spirituality because everyday stressors get the best of them; finding peace and happiness in the little joys of life can seem difficult, and results do not seem all that gratifying.
Achieving spirituality is a step-by-step process; there are ways through which one can become more spiritual every day.
Tenzin Gyatso, the current and 14th Dalai Lama, emphasizes the importance of inner peace in the world: 
Taoist meditation 
Taoist meditation (, ), also spelled Daoist (), refers to the traditional meditative practices associated with the Chinese philosophy and religion of Taoism, including concentration, mindfulness, contemplation, and visualization.
The earliest Chinese references to meditation date from the Warring States period (475–221 BCE).
Traditional Chinese medicine and Chinese martial arts have adapted certain Daoist meditative techniques.
Some examples are Daoyin "guide and pull" breathing exercises, Neidan "internal alchemy" techniques, Neigong "internal skill" practices, Qigong breathing exercises, Zhan zhuang "standing like a post" techniques.
The opposite direction of adoption has also taken place, when the martial art of Taijiquan, "great ultimate fist", became one of the practices of modern Daoist monks, while historically it was not among traditional techniques.
Terminology.
The Chinese language has several keywords for Daoist meditation practices, some of which are difficult to translate accurately into English.
Types of meditation.
Livia Kohn distinguishes three basic types of Daoist meditation: "concentrative", "insight", and "visualization".
"Ding" literally means "decide; settle; stabilize; definite; firm; solid" and early scholars such as Xuanzang used it to translate Sanskrit "samadhi" "deep meditative contemplation" in Chinese Buddhist texts.
In this sense, Kohn renders "ding" as "intent contemplation" or "perfect absorption".
The "Zuowanglun" has a section called "Taiding" "intense concentration" 
"Guan" basically means "look at (carefully); watch; observe; view; scrutinize" (and names the "Yijing" Hexagram 20 "Guan" "Viewing").
"Guan" became the Daoist technical term for "monastery; abbey", exemplified by Louguan "Tiered Abbey" temple, designating "Observation Tower", which was a major Daoist center from the 5th through 7th centuries (see Louguantai).
Kohn says the word "guan", "intimates the role of Daoist sacred sites as places of contact with celestial beings and observation of the stars".
Tang Dynasty (618–907) Daoist masters developed "guan" "observation" meditation from Tiantai Buddhist "zhiguan" "cessation and insight" meditation, corresponding to śamatha-vipaśyanā – the two basic types of Buddhist meditation are "samatha" "calm abiding; stabilizing meditation" and "vipassanā" "clear observation; analysis".
Kohn explains, "The two words indicate the two basic forms of Buddhist meditation: "zhi" is a concentrative exercise that achieves one-pointedness of mind or "cessation" of all thoughts and mental activities, while "guan" is a practice of open acceptance of sensory data, interpreted according to Buddhist doctrine as a form of "insight" or "wisdom".
"Guan" meditators would seek to merge individual consciousness into emptiness and attain unity with the Dao.
"Cun" usually means "exist; be present; live; survive; remain", but has a sense of "to cause to exist; to make present" in the Daoist meditation technique, which both the Shangqing School and Lingbao Schools popularized.
It thus means that the meditator, by an act of conscious concentration and focused intention, causes certain energies to be present in certain parts of the body or makes specific deities or scriptures appear before his or her mental eye.
For this reason, the word is most commonly rendered "to visualize" or, as a noun, "visualization."
Since, however, the basic meaning of "cun" is not just to see or be aware of but to be actually present, the translation "to actualize" or" actualization" may at times be correct if somewhat alien to the Western reader.
Other key words.
Within the above three types of Daoist meditation, some important practices are: 
Warring States period.
The earliest Chinese references to meditation date from the Warring States period (475–221 BCE), when the philosophical Hundred Schools of Thought flourished.
"Guanzi and Neiye".
Four chapters of the "Guanzi" have descriptions of meditation practices: "Xinshu" "Mind techniques" (chapters 36 and 37), "Baixin" "Purifying the mind" (38), and "Neiye" "Inward training" (49).
Modern scholars believe the "Neiye" text was written in the 4th century BCE, and the others were derived from it. A. C. Graham regards the "Neiye" as "possibly the oldest 'mystical' text in China"; Harold Roth describes it as "a manual on the theory and practice of meditation that contains the earliest references to breath control and the earliest discussion of the physiological basis of self-cultivation in the Chinese tradition".
Owing to the consensus that proto-Daoist Huang-Lao philosophers at the Jixia Academy in Qi composed the core "Guanzi", "Neiye" meditation techniques are technically "Daoistic" rather than "Daoist".
"Neiye" Verse 8 associates "dingxin" "stabilizing the mind" with acute hearing and clear vision, and generating "jing" "vital essence".
However, thought, says Roth, is considered "an impediment to attaining the well-ordered mind, particularly when it becomes excessive".
&lt;poem&gt;If you can be aligned and be tranquil, 
Only then can you be stable.
With a stable mind at your core, 
With the eyes and ears acute and clear, 
And with the four limbs firm and fixed, 
You can thereby make a lodging place for the vital essence.
The vital essence: it is the essence of the vital energy.
When the vital energy is guided, it [the vital essence] is generated, 
But when it is generated, there is thought, 
When there is thought, there is knowledge, 
But when there is knowledge, then you must stop.
Whenever the forms of the mind have excessive knowledge, 
You lose your vitality.&lt;/poem&gt; 
"Neiye" Verse 18 contains the earliest Chinese reference to practicing breath-control meditation.
Breathing is said to "coil and uncoil" or "contract and expand"', "with coiling/contracting referring to exhalation and uncoiling/expanding to inhalation".
&lt;poem&gt;For all [to practice] this Way: 
You must coil, you must contract, 
You must uncoil, you must expand, 
You must be firm, you must be regular [in this practice].
Hold fast to this excellent [practice]; do not let go of it.
Chase away the excessive; abandon the trivial.
And when you reach its ultimate limit 
You will return to the Way and its inner power. (18)&lt;/poem&gt; 
"Neiye" Verse 24 summarizes "inner cultivation" meditation in terms of "shouyi" 守一 "maintaining the one" and "yunqi" "revolving the "qi"".
Roth says this earliest extant "shouyi" reference "appears to be a meditative technique in which the adept concentrates on nothing but the Way, or some representation of it.
It is to be undertaken when you are sitting in a calm and unmoving position, and it enables you to set aside the disturbances of perceptions, thoughts, emotions, and desires that normally fill your conscious mind."
&lt;poem&gt;When you enlarge your mind and let go of it, 
When you relax your vital breath and expand it, 
When your body is calm and unmoving: 
And you can maintain the One and discard the myriad disturbances.
You will see profit and not be enticed by it, 
You will see harm and not be frightened by it.
Relaxed and unwound, yet acutely sensitive, 
In solitude you delight in your own person.
This is called "revolving the vital breath": 
Your thoughts and deeds seem heavenly. (24)&lt;/poem&gt; 
"Tao Te Ching".
Several passages in the classic "Tao Te Ching" are interpreted as referring to meditation.
For instance, "Attain utmost emptiness, Maintain utter stillness" (16) emphasizes "xu" "empty; void" and "jing" "still; quiet", both of which are central meditative concepts.
Randal P. Peerenboom describes Laozi's contemplative process as "apophatic meditation", the "emptying of all images (thoughts, feelings, and so on) rather than concentration on or filling the mind with images", comparable with Buddhist "nirodha-samapatti" "cessation of feelings and perceptions" meditation.
Verse 10 gives what Roth calls "probably the most important evidence for breathing meditation" in the "Tao Te Ching".
&lt;poem&gt;While you 
Cultivate the soul and embrace unity, 
can you keep them from separating?
Focus your vital breath until it is supremely soft, 
can you be like a baby?
Cleanse the mirror of mysteries, 
can you make it free of blemish?
Love the people and enliven the state, 
can you do so without cunning?
Open and close the gate of heaven, 
can you play the part of the female?
Reach out with clarity in all directions, 
can you refrain from action?
It gives birth to them and nurtures them, 
It gives birth to them but does not possess them, 
It rears them but does not control them.
This is called “mysterious integrity.”&lt;/poem&gt; 
Three of these "Tao Te Ching" phrases resonate with "Neiye" meditation vocabulary.
"Baoyi" 一"embrace unity" compares with "shouyi" "maintain the One" (24 above).
"Zhuanqi" "focus your vital breath" is "zhuanqi" "concentrating your vital breath" (19).
"Dichu xuanjian" "cleanse the mirror of mysteries" and "jingchu qi she" "diligently clean out its lodging place" (13) have the same verb "chu" "eliminate; remove".
The "Taodejing" exists in two received versions, named after the commentaries.
The "Heshang Gong version" (see below) explains textual references to Daoist meditation, but the "Wang Bi version" explains them away.
Wang Bi (226–249) was a scholar of "Xuanxue" "mysterious studies; neo-Daoism", which adapted Confucianism to explain Daoism, and his version eventually became the standard "Tao Te Ching" interpretation.
Richard Wilhelm said Wang Bi's commentary changed the "Tao Te Ching" "from a compendiary of magical meditation to a collection of free philosophical "aperçus"".
"Zhuangzi".
The (c. 4th–3rd centuries BCE) Daoist "Zhuangzi" refers to meditation in more specific terms than the "Tao Te Ching".
Two well-known examples of mental disciplines are Confucius and his favorite disciple Yan Hui discussing "xinzhai" "heart-mind fasting" and "zuowang" "sitting forgetting".
In the first dialogue, Confucius explains "xinzhai".
"I venture to ask what 'fasting of the mind' is," said Hui.&lt;br&gt; 
"Maintaining the unity of your will," said Confucius, "listen not with your ears but with your mind.
Listen not with your mind but with your primal breath.
The ears are limited to listening, the mind is limited to tallying.
The primal breath, however, awaits things emptily.
It is only through the Way that one can gather emptiness, and emptiness is the fasting of the mind."
(4)  
In the second, Yan Hui explains "zuowang" meditation.
&lt;poem&gt;Yen Hui saw Confucius again on another day and said, "I'm making progress."
"What do you mean?"
"I sit and forget."
"What do you mean, 'sit and forget'?"
Confucius asked with surprise.
"I slough off my limbs and trunk," said Yen Hui, "dim my intelligence, depart from my form, leave knowledge behind, and become identical with the Transformational Thoroughfare.
This is what I mean by 'sit and forget'."
"If you are identical," said Confucius, "then you have no preferences.
If you are transformed, then you have no more constants.
It's you who is really the worthy one!
Please permit me to follow after you."
(9)&lt;/poem&gt; 
Roth interprets this "slough off my limbs and trunk" () phrase to mean, "lose visceral awareness of the emotions and desires, which for the early Daoists, have 'physiological' bases in the various organs".
Peerenboom further describes "zuowang" as "aphophatic or cessation meditation."
One does away with sense perceptions, with all forms of cognition (thoughts, knowledge, conceptions, idea, images), with all valuations (preferences, norms, mores).
Cognate to and a variant of "wang" (—to forget) is "wang" (—to destroy, perish, disappear, not exist).
In the apophatic meditative process, all distinctions and ways of distinguishing are "forgotten" in the sense of eliminated: they cease to exist.
Another "Zhuangzi" chapter describes breathing meditation that results in a body "like withered wood" and a mind "like dead ashes".
Sir Motley of Southurb sat leaning against his low table.
He looked up to heaven and exhaled slowly.
Disembodied, he seemed bereft of soul.
Sir Wanderer of Countenance Complete, who stood in attendance before him, asked, "How can we explain this?
Can the body really be made to become like withered wood?
Can the mind really be made to become like dead ashes?
The one who is leaning against the table now is not the one who was formerly leaning against the table."
"Indeed," said Sir Motley, "your question is a good one, Yen.
Just now, I lost myself.
Can you understand this?
You may have heard the pipes of man, but not the pipes of earth.
You may have heard the pipes of earth, but not the pipes of heaven."
(2) 
Victor Mair presents "Zhuangzi" evidence for "close affinities between the Daoist sages and the ancient Indian holy men.
Yogic breath control and "asanas" (postures) were common to both traditions."
First, this reference to "breathing from the heels", which is a modern explanation of the "sirsasana" "supported headstand".
The true man [i.e., "zhenren"] of old did not dream when he slept and did not worry when he was awake.
His food was not savory, his breathing was deep.
The breathing of the true man is from his heels, the breathing of the common man is from his throat.
The words of those who unwillingly yield catch in their throats as though they were retching.
Those whose desires are deep-seated will have shallow natural reserves.
(6) 
Second, this "bear strides and bird stretches" reference to "xian" practices of yogic postures and breath exercises.
Retiring to bogs and marshes, dwelling in the vacant wilderness, fishing and living leisurely—all this is merely indicative of nonaction.
But it is favored by the scholars of rivers and lakes, men who flee from the world and wish to be idle.
Blowing and breathing, exhaling and inhaling, expelling the old and taking in the new, bear strides and bird stretches—all this is merely indicative of the desire for longevity.
But it is favored by scholars who channel the vital breath and flex the muscles and joints, men who nourish the physical form so as to emulate the hoary age of Progenitor P'eng [i.e., Peng Zu].
(15) 
Mair previously noted the (c. 168 BCE) Mawangdui Silk Texts, famous for two "Tao Te Ching" manuscripts, include a painted text that illustrates gymnastic exercises–including the "odd expression 'bear strides'".
"Xingqi" jade inscription.
Some writing on a Warring States era jade artifact could be an earlier record of breath meditation than the "Neiye", "Tao Te Ching", or "Zhuangzi".
This rhymed inscription entitled "xingqi" "circulating "qi"" was inscribed on a dodecagonal block of jade, tentatively identified as a pendant or a knob for a staff.
While the dating is uncertain, estimates range from approximately 380 BCE (Guo Moruo) to earlier than 400 BCE (Joseph Needham).
In any case, Roth says, "both agree that this is the earliest extant evidence for the practice of guided breathing in China".
The inscription says: 
&lt;poem&gt;To circulate the Vital Breath: 
Breathe deeply, then it will collect.
When it is collected, it will expand.
When it expands, it will descend.
When it descends, it will become stable.
When it is stable, it will be regular.
When it is regular, it will sprout.
When it sprouts, it will grow.
When it grows, it will recede.
When it recedes, it will become heavenly.
The dynamism of Heaven is revealed in the ascending; 
The dynamism of Earth is revealed in the descending.
Follow this and you will live; oppose it and you will die.&lt;/poem&gt; 
Practicing this series of exhalation and inhalation patterns, one becomes directly aware of the "dynamisms of Heaven and Earth" through ascending and descending breath.
"Tianji" , translated "dynamism of Heaven", also occurs in the "Zhuangzi" (6), as "natural reserves" in "Those whose desires are deep-seated will have shallow natural reserves".Roth notes the final line's contrasting verbs, "xun" "follow; accord with" and "ni" "oppose; resist", were similarly used in the (168 BCE) "Huangdi Sijing" Yin-yang silk manuscripts.
Han Dynasty.
As Daoism was flourishing during the Han Dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), meditation practitioners continued early techniques and developed new ones.
"Huainanzi".
The (139 BCE) "Huainanzi", which is an eclectic compilation attributed to Liu An, frequently describes meditation, especially as a means for rulers to achieve effective government.
Internal evidence reveals that the "Huainanzi" authors were familiar with the "Guanzi" methods of meditation.
The text uses "xinshu" "mind techniques" both as a general term for "inner cultivation" meditation practices and as a specific name for the "Guanzi" chapters.
The essentials of the world: do not lie in the Other but instead lie in the self; do not lie in other people but instead lie in your own person.
When you fully realize it [the Way] in your own person, then all the myriad things will be arrayed before you.
When you thoroughly penetrate the teachings of the Techniques of the Mind, then you will be able to put lusts and desires, likes and dislikes, outside yourself.
Several "Huainanzi" passages associate breath control meditation with longevity and immortality.
For example, two famous "xian" "immortals": 
Now Wang Qiao and Chi Songzi exhaled and inhaled, spitting out the old and internalizing the new.
They cast off form and abandoned wisdom; they embraced simplicity and returned to genuineness; in roaming with the mysterious and subtle above, they penetrated to the clouds and Heaven.
Now if one wants to study their Way and does not attain their nurturing of the "qi" and their lodging of the spirit but only imitates their every exhale and inhale, their contracting and expanding, it is clear that one will not be able to mount the clouds and ascend on the vapors.
"Heshang gong" commentary.
The (c. 2nd century CE) "Tao Te Ching" commentary attributed to Heshang Gong (lit.
"Riverbank Elder") provides what Kohn calls the "first evidence for Daoist meditation" and "proposes a concentrative focus on the breath for harmonization with the Dao".
Eduard Erkes says the purpose of the Heshang Gong commentary was not only to explicate the "Tao Te Ching", but chiefly to enable "the reader to make practical use of the book and in teaching him to use it as a guide to meditation and to a life becoming a Daoist skilled in meditative training".
Two examples from "Tao Te Ching" 10 (see above) are the Daoist meditation terms "xuanlan" (lit. "dark/mysterious display") "observe with a tranquil mind" and "tianmen" (lit. "gate of heaven") "middle of the forehead".
"Xuanlan" occurs in the line that Mair renders "Cleanse the mirror of mysteries".
Erkes translates "By purifying and cleansing one gets the dark look", because the commentary says, "One must purify one's mind and let it become clear.
If the mind stays in dark places, the look knows all its doings.
Therefore it is called the dark look."
Erkes explains "xuanlan" as "the Daoist term for the position of the eyes during meditation, when they are half-closed and fixed on the point of the nose."
"Tianmen" occurs in the line "Open and close the gate of heaven".
The Heshang commentary says, "The gate of heaven is called the purple secret palace of the north-pole.
To open and shut means to end and to begin with the five junctures.
In the practice of asceticism, the gate of heaven means the nostrils.
To open means to breathe hard; to shut means to inhale and exhale."
"Taiping jing".
The (c. 1st century BCE to 2nd century CE) "Taiping Jing" "Scripture of Great Peace" emphasized "shouyi" "guarding the One" meditation, in which one visualizes different cosmic colors corresponding with different parts of one's body.
In a state of complete concentration, when the light first arises, make sure to hold on to it and never let it go.
First of all, it will be red, after a long time it will change to be white, later again it will be green, and then it will pervade all of you completely.
When you further persist in guarding the One, there will be nothing within that would not be brilliantly illuminated, and the hundred diseases will be driven out.
Besides "guarding the One" where a meditator is assisted by the god of Heaven, the "Taiping jing" also mentions "guarding the Two" with help from the god of Earth, "guarding the Three" with help from spirits of the dead, and "guarding the Four" or "Five" in which one is helped by the myriad beings.
The "Taiping jing shengjun bizhi" "Secret Directions of the Holy Lord on the Scripture of Great Peace" is a Tang-period collection of "Taiping jing" fragments concerning meditation.
It provides some detailed information, for instance, interpretations of the colors visualized.
In guarding the light of the One, you may see a light as bright the rising sun.
This is a brilliance as strong as that of the sun at noon.
In guarding the light of the One, you may see a light entirely green.
When this green is pure, it is the light of lesser yang.
In guarding the light of the One, you may see a light entirely red, just like fire.
This is a sign of transcendence.
In guarding the light of the One, you may see a light entirely yellow.
When this develops a greenish tinge, it is the light of central harmony.
This is a potent remedy of the Tao.
In guarding the light of the One, you may see a light entirely white.
When this is as clear as flowing water, it is the light of lesser yin.
In guarding the light of the One, you may see a light entirely black.
When this shimmers like deep water, it is the light of greater yin.
In the year 142, Zhang Daoling founded the Tianshi "Celestial Masters" movement, which was the first organized form of Taoist religion.
Zhang and his followers practiced "Taiping jing" meditation and visualization techniques.
After the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice rebellion against the Han Dynasty, Zhang established a theocratic state in 215, which led to the downfall of the Han.
Six Dynasties.
The historical term "Six Dynasties" collectively refers to the Three Kingdoms (220–280 CE), Jin Dynasty (266–420), and Southern and Northern Dynasties (420–589).
During this period of disunity after the fall of the Han, Chinese Buddhism became popular and new schools of religious Daoism emerged.
Early visualization meditation.
Daoism's "first formal visualization texts appear" in the 3rd century.
The "Huangting jing" "Scripture of the Yellow Court" is probably the earliest text describing inner gods and spirits located in the human body.
Meditative practices described in the "Huangting jing" include visualization of bodily organs and their gods, visualization of the sun and moon, and absorption of "neijing" "inner light".
The "Laozi zhongjing" "Central Scripture of Laozi" similarly describes visualizing and activating gods within the body, along with breathing exercises for meditation and longevity techniques.
The adept envisions the yellow and red essences of the sun and moon, which activates Laozi and "Yunü" "Jade Woman" within the abdomen, producing the "shengtai" "sacred embryo".
The "Cantong qi" "Kinship of the Three", attributed to Wei Boyang (fl. 2nd century), criticizes Daoist methods of meditation on inner deities.
"Baopuzi".
The Jin Dynasty scholar Ge Hong's (c. 320) "Baopuzi" "Master who Embraces Simplicity", which is an invaluable source for early Daoism, describes "shouyi" "guarding the One" meditation as a source for magical powers from the "zhenyi" "True One".
Realizing the True One, the original unity and primordial oneness of all, meant placing oneself at the center of the universe, identifying one's physical organs with constellations in the stars.
The practice led to control over all the forces of nature and beyond, especially over demons and evil forces.
Ge Hong says his teacher Zheng Yin taught that: 
If a man can preserve Unity, Unity will also preserve him.
In this way the bare blade finds no place in his body to inserts its edge; harmful things find no place in him that will admit entrance to their evil.
Therefore, in defeat it is possible to be victorious; in positions of peril, to feel only security.
Whether in the shrine of a ghost, in the mountains or forests, in a place suffering the plague, within a tomb, in bush inhabited by tigers and wolves, or in the habitation of snakes, all evils will go far away as long as one remains diligent in the preservation of Unity.
(18) 
The "Baopuzi" also compares "shouyi" meditation with a complex "mingjing" "bright mirror" multilocation visualization process through which an individual can mystically appear in several places at once.
My teacher used to say that to preserve Unity was to practice jointly Bright Mirror, and that on becoming successful in the mirror procedure a man would be able to multiply his body to several dozen all with the same dress and facial expression.

Shangqing meditation.
The Daoist school of Shangqing "Highest Clarity" traces its origins to Wei Huacun (252–334), who was a Tianshi adept proficient in meditation techniques.
Shangqing adopted the "Huangting jing" as scripture, and the hagiography of Wei Huacun claims a "xian" "immortal" transmitted it (and thirty other texts) to her in 288.
Additional divine texts were supposedly transmitted to Yang Xi from 364 to 370, constituting the Shangqing scriptures.
The practices they describe include not only concentration on the "bajing" (Eight Effulgences) and visualization of gods in the body, but also active interaction with the gods, ecstatic excursions to the stars and the heavens of the immortals ("yuanyou" ), and the activation of inner energies in a protoform of inner alchemy ("neidan").
The world of meditation in this tradition is incomparably rich and colorful, with gods, immortals, body energies, and cosmic sprouts vying for the adept's attention.
Lingbao meditation.
Beginning around 400 CE, the Lingbao "Numinous Treasure" School eclectically adopted concepts and practices from Daoism and Buddhism, which had recently been introduced to China.
Ge Chaofu, Ge Hong's grandnephew, "released to the world" the "Wufu jing" "Talismans of the Numinous Treasure" and other Lingbao scriptures, and claimed family transmission down from Ge Xuan (164–244), Ge Hong's great uncle.
The Lingbao School added the Buddhist concept of reincarnation to the Daoist tradition of "xian" "immortality; longevity", and viewed meditation as a means to unify body and spirit.
Many Lingbao meditation methods came from native Chinese traditions, such as visualizing inner gods ("Taiping jing"), and circulating the solar and lunar essences ("Huangting jing" and "Laozi zhongjing").
Meditation rituals changed from individuals practicing privately to Lingbao clergy worshipping communally; frequently with the "multidimensional quality" of a priest performing interior visualizations while leading congregants in communal visualization rites.
Buddhist influences.
During the Southern and Northern Dynasties period, the introduction of traditional Buddhist meditation methods richly influenced Daoist meditation.
The (c. late 5th-century) The Northern Celestial Masters text "Xishengjing" "Scripture of Western Ascension" recommends cultivating an empty state of consciousness called "wuxin" (lit. "no mind") "cease all mental activity" (translating Sanskrit "acitta" from "citta" "mind"), and advocates a simple form of "guan" "observation" insight meditation (translating "vipassanā" from "vidyā" "knowledge").
Two early Chinese encyclopedias, the (c. 570) Daoist encyclopedia "Wushang biyao" "Supreme Secret Essentials" and the (7th century) Buddhistic "Daojiao yishu" "Pivotal Meaning of Daoist Teachings" distinguish various levels of "guan" "observation" insight meditation, under the influence of the Buddhist Madhyamaka school's Two truths doctrine.
The "Daojiao yishu", for instance, says.
Realize also that in concentration and insight, one does not reach enlightenment and perfection of body and mind through the two major kinds of observation [of energy and spirit] alone.
Rather, there are five different sets of three levels of observation.
One such set of three is: 1.
Observation of apparent existence.
2.
Observation of real existence.
3.
Observation of partial emptiness.
Tang Dynasty.
Daoism was in competition with Confucianism and Buddhism during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), and Daoists integrated new meditation theories and techniques from Buddhists.
The 8th century was a "heyday" of Daoist meditation; recorded in works such as Sun Simiao's "Cunshen lianqi ming" "Inscription on Visualization of Spirit and Refinement of Energy", Sima Chengzhen 's "Zuowanglun" "Essay on Sitting in Forgetfulness", and Wu Yun 's "Shenxian kexue lun" "Essay on How One May Become a Divine Immortal through Training".
These Daoist classics reflect a variety of meditation practices, including concentration exercises, visualizations of body energies and celestial deities to a state of total absorption in the Dao, and contemplations of the world.
The (9th century) "Qingjing Jing" "Scripture of Clarity and Quiescence" associates the Tianshi tradition of a divinized Laozi with Daoist "guan" and Buddhist "vipaśyanā" methods of insight meditation.
Song Dynasty.
Under the Song Dynasty (960–1279), the Daoist schools of Quanzhen "Complete Authenticity" and Zhengyi "Orthodox Unity" emerged, and Neo-Confucianism became prominent.
Along with the continued integration of meditation methods, two new visualization and concentration practices became popular.
"Neidan" "inner alchemy" involved the circulation and refinement of inner energies in a rhythm based on the "Yijing".
Meditation focused upon starry deities (e.g., the "Santai" "Three Steps" stars in Ursa Major) and warrior protectors (e.g., the " Xuanwu" "Dark Warrior; Black Tortoise" Northern Sky spirit).
Later dynasties.
During the Yuan Dynasty (1279–1367), Daoists continued to develop the Song period practices of "neidan" alchemy and deity visualizations.
Under the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644), "neidan" methods were interchanged between Daoism and Chan Buddhism.
Many literati in the scholar-official class practiced Daoist and Buddhist meditations, which exerted a stronger influence on Confucianism.
In the Qing Dynasty (1644–1912), Daoists wrote the first specialized texts on "nüdan" "inner alchemy for women", and developed new forms of physical meditation, notably "Taijiquan"—sometimes described as meditation in motion or moving meditation.
This "Neijia" internal martial art is named after the Taijitu symbol, which was a traditional focus in both Daoist and Neo-Confucian meditation.
Modern period.
Daoism and other Chinese religions were suppressed under the Republic of China (1912–1949) and in the People's Republic of China from 1949 to 1979.
Many Daoist temples and monasteries have been reopened in recent years.
Western knowledge of Daoist meditation was stimulated by Richard Wilhelm's (German 1929, English 1962) "The Secret of the Golden Flower" translation of the (17th century) "neidan" text "Taiyi jinhua zongzhi" .
In the 20th century, the "Qigong" movement has incorporated and popularized Daoist meditation, and "mainly employs concentrative exercises but also favors the circulation of energy in an inner-alchemical mode".
Teachers have created new methods of meditation, such as Wang Xiangzhai's "zhan zhuang" "standing like a post" in the "Yiquan" school.

Footnotes 
Japa 
Japa () is the meditative repetition of a mantra or a divine name.
It is a practice found in Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism, and Buddhism, with parallels found in other religions.
"Japa" may be performed while sitting in a meditation posture, while performing other activities, or as part of formal worship in group settings.
The mantra or name may be spoken softly, loud enough for the practitioner to hear it, or it may be recited silently within the practitioner's mind.
Etymology.
The Sanskrit word "japa" is derived from the root "jap-", meaning "to utter in a low voice, repeat internally, mutter".
It can be further defined as "ja" to destroy birth, death, and reincarnation and "pa" meaning to destroy ones sins.
Monier-Williams states that the term appears in Vedic literature such as in the Aitareya Brahmana (Rigveda) and the Shatapatha Brahmana (Yajurveda).
The term means muttering, whispering or murmuring passages from the scripture, or charms, or names of deity.
Often it is the repetitive singing of a verse or mantra, sometimes counted with the help of a rosary which is called "japamala".
A related word, "japana" appears in Book 12 of the Mahabharata, where muttering prayers is described as a form of religious offering.
The concept of "japa" is also found in early Buddhist texts, and is very common in Tibetan Buddhism literature.
According to the sage Patanjali (400 CE), "Japa" is not the repetition of word or phase but rather contemplation on the meaning of the mantra, this definition sometimes persists across different sources.
Varieties.
Beads.
In some forms of "japa", the repetitions are counted using a string of beads known as a "japamala".
Many different types of materials are used for "japa".
The number of beads in the "japamala" is generally 108.
It is not uncommon for people to wear "japa" beads around their neck, although some practitioners prefer to carry them in a bead-bag in order to keep them clean.
Degrees of loudness.
"Japa" may be performed in varying degrees of loudness: 
"Likhita japa".
"Likhita japa" is the writing of a mantra while, usually, reciting it aloud at the same time.
Proponents say it is more effective than simply reciting the mantra aloud.
"Likhita japa" is often written in a book dedicated to the purpose.
Books intended for shorter mantras have a grid of rectangular cells with each cell holding one instance of the mantra.
Practitioners may use different coloured ink to write in certain cells in order to make a decorative or symbolic pattern.
"Mantracakra"s.
Tibetan Buddhists include "japa" meditation as a large part of their religious practices.
In Tibet, states Harvey Alper, the prayer wheels are instruments for "japa".
The practice of "nembutsu" in Pure Land Buddhism is analogous to "japa".
Aims.
The stated aim, or goal of "japa" may vary greatly depending on the mantra involved and the religious philosophy of the practitioner.
In both Buddhist and Hindu traditions mantras may be given to aspirants by their guru, after some form of initiation.
The stated goal could be moksha, nirvana, bhakti, or simple personal communion with a divine power in a similar way to prayer.
Many gurus and other spiritual teachers, and other religious leaders, especially Hindu and Buddhist, teach that these represent different names for the same transformed state of consciousness.
However, this claim is not made about mantras that are not intended for spiritual growth and self-realization.
After long use of a mantra that is intended to foster self-realization or intimacy with a divine power, an individual may reach a state of "ajapa japa", or , wherein the mantra "repeats itself" in the mind.
Similar states have been reached by adherents to other major faith traditions, using prayers from their own traditions.
Analogues in other traditions.
Some Catholic prayer forms that involve repetition, such as use of the Rosary or one of various chaplets, are similar to "japa", although the practices are not identical because their aims differ.
Mental methods of repeated short prayers, very similar to "japa" are also used in Christian traditions, most notably the practice of repeating the Jesus Prayer found in the Eastern Orthodox Church.
Moreover, the goal of "ajapa japa" is quite similar to the Christian aim of "unceasing prayer".
The practice of "dhikr" by Sufis is similar to "japa".
The two main Sikh scriptures open with sections, named after the term, and these are called Japji Sahib and Jaap Sahib.

Astavakrasana 
Astavakrasana (; IAST: "Aṣṭāvakrāsana") or Eight-Angle Pose is a hand-balancing asana in modern yoga as exercise dedicated to the sage Astavakra, the spiritual guru of King Janaka.
Etymology and origins.
The name comes from the Sanskrit words अष्टा "ashta" meaning "eight", वक्र "vakra" meaning "bent, curved", and आसन "asana" meaning "posture" or "seat"; or alternatively from the myth of the sage Astavakra.
The pose is unknown in hatha yoga until the 20th century "Light on Yoga", but the pose appears in the 1896 "Vyayama Dipika", a manual of gymnastics, so Norman Sjoman suggests that it is one of the poses adopted into modern yoga in Mysore by Krishnamacharya.
The pose would then have been taken up by his pupils Pattabhi Jois and B. K. S. Iyengar.
Mythology.
According to B. K. S. Iyengar's "Light on Yoga", Astavakra was believed to be the spiritual guru of King Janaka, father of Sita.
When he was in his mother's womb, his father Kagola recited the Vedas inaccurately, making the unborn child laugh.
Kagola, furious, put a curse on the baby to be born bent in eight places, "Astavakra" meaning eight bends.
Kagola was defeated in debate with the court scholar, Vandi.
The young Astavakra beat Vandi in argument, and became Janaka's guru.
His father blessed him for this, and his deformity vanished.
Description.
Astavakrasana is a hand balance with lateral twist.
The pose is entered from a squatting position, one arm between the feet, the other just outside the other foot, palms on the floor.
Pushing up and lifting both legs from the floor gives a variant or preparatory position, with both legs bent, one leg over one forearm, the other leg crossed over the first at the ankle.
Straightening the legs gives the full pose.
Preparatory poses for astavakrasana include the plank pose, Parsva Bakasana (Side Crane pose), Paripurna Navasana and others.
The pose may be practised with blocks laid flat under the hands.
Matrimandir 
The Matrimandir (Sanskrit for "Temple of The Mother") is an edifice of spiritual significance for practitioners of Integral yoga, in the centre of Auroville established by The Mother of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram.
It is called "soul of the city" and is situated in a large open space called "Peace".
Structure and surroundings.
The Matrimandir took 37 years to build, from the laying of the foundation stone at sunrise on 21 February 1971 - the Mother's 93rd birthday - to its completion in May 2008.
It is in the form of a huge sphere surrounded by twelve petals.
The Geodesic dome is covered by golden discs and reflects sunlight, which gives the structure its characteristic radiance.
Inside the central dome is a meditation hall known as the "inner chamber" - this contains the largest optically-perfect glass globe in the world.
The Matrimandir, and its surrounding gardens in the central Peace Area, is open to the public by appointment.
The four main pillars that support the structure of Matrimandir, and carry the Inner Chamber, have been set at the four main directions of the compass.
These four pillars are symbolic of the four aspects of the mother as described by Sri Aurobindo, and are named after these four aspects.
Global Vipassana Pagoda 
The Global Vipassana Pagoda is a Meditation dome hall with a capacity to seat around 8,000 Vipassana meditators (the largest such meditation hall in the world) near Gorai, north-west of Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.
The pagoda was inaugurated by Pratibha Patil, then President of India, on 8 February 2009.
It is built on donated land on a peninsula between Gorai creek and the Arabian Sea.
The pagoda is to serve as a monument of peace and harmony.
The Global Vipassana Pagoda has been built out of gratitude to Sayagyi U Ba Khin (1899 - 1971), Vipassana teacher and the first Accountant-General of Independent Burma, who was instrumental in Vipassana returning to India, the country of its origin.
Built entirely through voluntary donations, the purpose of the Global Vipassana Pagoda is to:  
1) Share information about Vipassana  
2) spread information on Gotama the Buddha and his teachings.
Vipassanā is the practical quintessence of the universal, non-sectarian teachings of the Buddha.
Its traditional Burmese design is an expression of gratitude towards the country of Myanmar for preserving the practice of Vipassana.
The shape of the pagoda is a copy of the Shwedagon Pagoda (Golden Pagoda) in Yangon, Myanmar.
It was built combining ancient Indian and modern technology to enable it to last for a thousand years.
Description.
The center of the Global Vipassana Pagoda contains the world's largest stone dome built without any supporting pillars.
The height of the dome is approximately 29 meters, while the height of the building is 99.06 meters, which is twice the size of the previously largest hollow stone monument in the world, the Gol Gumbaz Dome in Bijapur, India.
The external diameter of the largest section of the dome is 97.46 m and the shorter sections are 94.82m.
The internal diameter is 85.15 m.
The inside of the pagoda is hollow and serves as a very large meditation hall with an area covering more than 6000 m2 (65,000 ft2).
The massive inner dome seats over 8000 people enabling them to practice the non-sectarian Vipassana meditation as taught by S. N. Goenka and now being practiced in over 100 countries.
An inaugural one-day meditation course was held at the pagoda on 21 December 2008, with Goenka in attendance as the teacher.
Ten-day vipassana meditation courses are held free of charge at the Dhamma Pattana meditation center that is part of the Global Vipassana Pagoda complex.
Construction history.
Timeline.
Planning for the construction of the Global Vipassana Pagoda began in 1997, while actual building work started in 2000.
The pagoda consists of three sub-domes.
The first and largest dome was completed in October 2006 when bone relics of Gotama Buddha were enshrined in the central locking stone of the dome on 29 October 2006, making it the world's largest structure containing relics of the Buddha.
The relics were originally found in the stupa at Bhattiprolu, Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh, South India.
They have been donated by the Mahabodhi Society of India and the prime minister of Sri Lanka to be kept at the Global Vipassana Pagoda.
The second and third domes sit atop the first dome.
Construction of the third dome was structurally completed on 21 November 2008.
The Global Vipassana Pagoda complex is an evolving construction.
A museum depicts the historical life and non-sectarian teaching of Gotama the Buddha.
The Global Vipassana Pagoda's educational displays communicate the Buddha's teaching of the universal practice of Vipassana as a path towards real happiness.
The Global Vipassana Pagoda complex consists of the following structures: 
The south pagoda contains 108 meditation cells for use by Vipassana students taking a meditation course at the adjoining meditation centre.
Construction materials.
The foundation of the dome consists of basalt, while the dome itself is made from sandstone brought from Rajasthan.
The individual blocks of sandstone weigh 600–700 kg each and are kept in place due to the unique design of the bricks.
Each of the bricks interlock with the ones adjacent to it and lime mortar is used to fill in any remaining gaps.
The circumambulation path is laid in marble.
The pinnacle of the pagoda is adorned with a large crystal.
The spire is covered in real gold, while the rest of the pagoda is covered in gold paint.
The spire is topped with a special ornamental umbrella piece donated by the Burmese.
The main doors to the pagoda are wooden and hand-carved in Myanmar (Burma).
Transcendental Meditation 
Transcendental Meditation (TM) is a form of silent mantra meditation advocated by the Transcendental Meditation movement.&lt;ref name="Britannica online/TM"&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; Maharishi Mahesh Yogi began teaching the technique in India in the mid-1950s.
Advocates of TM claim that the technique promotes a state of relaxed awareness, stress relief, and access to higher states of consciousness, as well as physiological benefits such as reducing the risk of heart disease and high blood pressure.
Building on the teachings of his master Brahmananda Saraswati (known honorifically as Guru Dev), the Maharishi taught thousands of people during a series of world tours from 1958 to 1965, expressing his teachings in spiritual and religious terms.
TM became more popular in the 1960s and 1970s, as the Maharishi shifted to a more technical presentation, and his meditation technique was practiced by celebrities, most prominently members of the Beatles and the Beach Boys.
At this time, he began training TM teachers and created specialized organizations to present TM to specific segments of the population such as business people and students.
By the early 2000s, TM had been taught to millions of people; the worldwide TM organization had grown to include educational programs, health products, and related services.
Following the Maharishi's death in 2008, leadership of the TM organization passed to neuroscientist Tony Nader.
The TM technique involves the use of a silently-used sound called "mantra", and is practiced for 15–20 minutes twice per day.
It is taught by certified teachers through a standard course of instruction, which costs a fee that varies by country.
According to the Transcendental Meditation movement, it is a non-religious method for relaxation, stress relief, and self-development.
The technique has been seen as both religious and non-religious; sociologists, religion scholars, and a New Jersey judge and court are among those who have expressed views on it being religious or non-religious.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit upheld the federal ruling that TM was essentially "religious in nature" and therefore could not be taught in public schools.
A 2015 review found that TM may reduce blood pressure compared to control groups while a trend over time indicates practicing TM may lower blood pressure.
Such effects are comparable to other lifestyle interventions.
Conflicting findings across reviews and a potential risk of bias indicated the necessity of further evidence, conducted by researchers without bias.
History.
The Transcendental Meditation program and the Transcendental Meditation movement originated with their founder Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and continued beyond his death in 2008.
In 1955, "the Maharishi began publicly teaching a traditional meditation technique" learned from his master Brahmananda Saraswati that he called Transcendental Deep Meditation and later renamed Transcendental Meditation.
The Maharishi initiated thousands of people, then developed a TM teacher training program as a way to accelerate the rate of bringing the technique to more people.
He also inaugurated a series of tours that started in India in 1955 and went international in 1958 which promoted Transcendental Meditation.
These factors, coupled with endorsements by celebrities who practiced TM and claims that scientific research had validated the technique, helped to popularize TM in the 1960s and 1970s.
By the late 2000s, TM had been taught to millions of individuals and the Maharishi was overseeing a large multinational movement.
Despite organizational changes and the addition of advanced meditative techniques in the 1970s, the Transcendental Meditation technique has remained relatively unchanged.
Among the first organizations to promote TM were the Spiritual Regeneration Movement and the International Meditation Society.
In modern times, the movement has grown to encompass schools and universities that teach the practice, and includes many associated programs based on the Maharishi's interpretation of the Vedic traditions.
In the U.S., non-profit organizations included the Students International Meditation Society, AFSCI, World Plan Executive Council, Maharishi Vedic Education Development Corporation, Global Country of World Peace, Transcendental Meditation for Women, and Maharishi Foundation.
The successor to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and leader of the Global Country of World Peace, is Tony Nader.
Technique.
The meditation practice involves the use of a silently-used mantra for 15–20 minutes twice per day while sitting with the eyes closed.
It is reported to be one of the most widely practiced, and among the most widely researched, meditation techniques, with hundreds of published research studies.
The technique is made available worldwide by certified TM teachers in a seven-step course, and fees vary from country to country.
Beginning in 1965, the Transcendental Meditation technique has been incorporated into selected schools, universities, corporations, and prison programs in the US, Latin America, Europe, and India.
In 1977 a US district court ruled that a curriculum in TM and the Science of Creative Intelligence (SCI) being taught in some New Jersey schools was religious in nature and in violation of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.
The technique has since been included in a number of educational and social programs around the world.
The Transcendental Meditation technique has been described as both religious and non-religious, as an aspect of a new religious movement, as rooted in Hinduism, and as a non-religious practice for self-development.
The public presentation of the TM technique over its 50-year history has been praised for its high visibility in the mass media and effective global propagation, and criticized for using celebrity and scientific endorsements as a marketing tool.
Also, advanced courses supplement the TM technique and include an advanced meditation program called the TM-Sidhi program.
Movement.
The Transcendental Meditation movement consists of the programs and organizations connected with the Transcendental Meditation technique and founded by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.
Transcendental Meditation was first taught in the 1950s in India and has continued since the Maharishi's death in 2008.
The organization was estimated to have 900,000 participants worldwide in 1977, a million by the 1980s, and 5 million in more recent years.
Programs include the Transcendental Meditation technique, an advanced meditation practice called the TM-Sidhi program ("Yogic Flying"), an alternative health care program called Maharishi Ayurveda, and a system of building and architecture called Maharishi Sthapatya Ved.
The TM movement's past and present media endeavors include a publishing company (MUM Press), a television station (KSCI), a radio station (KHOE), and a satellite television channel (Maharishi Channel).
During its 50-year history, its products and services have been offered through a variety of organizations, which are primarily nonprofit and educational.
These include the Spiritual Regeneration Movement, the International Meditation Society, World Plan Executive Council, Maharishi Vedic Education Development Corporation, Transcendental Meditation for Women, the Global Country of World Peace, and the David Lynch Foundation.
The TM movement also operates a worldwide network of Transcendental Meditation teaching centers, schools, universities, health centers, herbal supplements, solar panel, and home financing companies, plus several TM-centered communities.
The global organization is reported to have an estimated net worth of USD 3.5 billion.
The TM movement has been characterized in a variety of ways and has been called a spiritual movement, a new religious movement, a millenarian movement, a world affirming movement, a new social movement, a guru-centered movement, a personal growth movement, a religion, and a cult.
Additional sources contend that TM and its movement are not a cult.
Participants in TM programs are not required to adopt a belief system; it is practiced by atheists, agnostics and people from a variety of religious affiliations.
The organization has been the subject of controversies that includes being labelled a cult by several parliamentary inquiries or anti-cult movements in the world.
Some notable figures in pop-culture practicing TM include The Beatles, The Beach Boys, Kendall Jenner, Hugh Jackman, Tom Hanks, Jennifer Lopez, Mick Jagger, Eva Mendez, Moby, David Lynch, Jennifer Aniston, Nicole Kidman, Eric André, Jerry Seinfeld, Howard Stern, Julia Fox, Clint Eastwood, Martin Scorsese, Russell Brand, Nick Cave and Oprah Winfrey.
Health effects.
TM may reduce blood pressure according to a 2015 review that compared TM to control groups.
A trend over time indicates practicing TM may lower blood pressure.
Such effects are comparable to other lifestyle interventions.
Conflicting findings across reviews and a potential risk of bias indicated the necessity of further evidence, conducted by researchers without bias.
A 2012 meta-analysis published in "Psychological Bulletin", which reviewed 163 individual studies, tentatively found that Transcendental Meditation produced superior results in "reducing negative emotions, trait anxiety, and neuroticism" as well as improving markers of learning, memory, and self-actualization by comparison with other meditation approaches; the researchers nonetheless recommended improved methodologies for future research.
A 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis funded by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found moderate evidence for improvement in anxiety, depression and pain with low evidence for improvement in stress and mental health-related quality of life.
A 2013 statement from the American Heart Association said that TM could be considered as a treatment for hypertension, although other interventions such as exercise and device-guided breathing were more effective and better supported by clinical evidence.
A 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 studies found that TM may reduce blood pressure compared to control groups, although the underlying studies may have been biased and further studies with better designs are needed.
A 2023 study in "PLOS One" found that doing two daily sessions of TM "rapidly and significantly reduced symptoms of burnout, insomnia, and psychological distress" in a sample of 65 healthcare workers.
The first studies of the health effects of Transcendental Meditation appeared in the early 1970s.
By 2004 the US government had given more than $20 million to Maharishi International University to study the effect of meditation on health.
Theoretical concepts.
Views on consciousness (1963).
In his 1963 book, "The Science of Being and Art of Living," Maharishi Mahesh Yogi says that, over time, through the practice of the TM technique, the conscious mind gains familiarity with deeper levels of the mind, bringing the subconscious mind within the capacity of the conscious mind, resulting in expanded awareness in daily activity.
He also teaches that the Transcendental Meditation practitioner transcends all mental activity and experiences the 'source of thought', which is said to be pure silence, 'pure awareness' or 'transcendental Being', 'the ultimate reality of life'.
TM is sometimes self described as a technology of consciousness.
According to author Michael Phelan "The fundamental premise of the psychology of fulfillment is that within every person exists a seemingly inexhaustible center of energy, intelligence, and satisfaction...
To the extent that our behavior depends on the degree of energy and intelligence available to us, this center of pure creative intelligence may be described as that resource which gives direction to all that we experience, think and do."
According to the Maharishi, there are seven levels of consciousness: (i) deep sleep; (ii) dreaming; (iii) waking; (iv) transcendental consciousness; (v) cosmic consciousness; (vi) God consciousness; and, (vii) unity consciousness.
The Maharishi says that transcendental consciousness can be experienced through Transcendental Meditation, and that those who meditate regularly over time could become aware of cosmic consciousness.
An indication of cosmic consciousness is "ever present wakefulness" present even during sleep.
Research on long-term TM practitioners experiencing what they describe as cosmic consciousness, has identified unique EEG profiles, muscle tone measurements, and REM indicators that suggest physiological parameters for this self described state of consciousness.
However, the Cambridge Handbook of Consciousness notes that it is premature to say that the EEG coherence found in TM is an indication of a higher state of consciousness.
Science of Creative Intelligence (1971).
In 1961, the Maharishi created the "International Meditation Society for the Science of Creative Intelligence".
In 1971 the Maharishi inaugurated "Maharishi's Year of Science of Creative Intelligence" and described SCI as the connection of "modern science with ancient Vedic science".
Author Philip Goldberg describes it as Vedanta philosophy that has been translated into scientific language.
A series of international symposiums on the Science of Creative Intelligence were held between 1970 and 1973 and were attended by scientists and "leading thinkers", including Buckminster Fuller, Melvin Calvin, a Nobel Prize winner in chemistry, Hans Selye, Marshal McLuhan and Jonas Salk.
These symposiums were held at universities such as Humboldt State University and University of Massachusetts.
The following year, the Maharishi developed a World Plan to spread his teaching of SCI around the world.
The theoretical part of SCI is taught in a 33-lesson video course.
In the early 1970s the SCI course was offered at more than 25 American universities including Stanford University, Yale, the University of Colorado, the University of Wisconsin, and Oregon State University.
Until 2009, Maharishi University of Management (MUM) required its undergraduate students to take SCI classes, and both MUM and Maharishi European Research University (MERU) in Switzerland have awarded degrees in the field.
"The Independent" reports that children at Maharishi School learn SCI principles such as "the nature of life is to grow" and "order is present everywhere".
SCI is reported to be part of the curriculum of TM related lower schools in Iowa, Wheaton, Maryland and Skelmersdale, UK.
In 1975 SCI was used as the call letters for a TM owned television station in San Bernardino, California.
The Science of Creative Intelligence is not science.
Theologian Robert M. Price, writing in the "Creation/Evolution Journal" (the journal of the National Center for Science Education), compares the Science of Creative Intelligence to Creationism.
Price says instruction in the Transcendental Meditation technique is "never offered without indoctrination into the metaphysics of 'creative intelligence'".
Skeptic James Randi says SCI has "no scientific characteristics."
Astrophysicist and sceptic Carl Sagan writes that the "Hindu doctrine" of TM is a pseudoscience.
Irving Hexham, a professor of religious studies, describes the TM teachings as "pseudoscientific language that masks its religious nature by mythologizing science".
Sociologists Rodney Stark and William Sims Bainbridge describe the SCI videotapes as largely based on the Bhagavad Gita, and say that they are "laced with parables and metaphysical postulates, rather than anything that can be recognized as conventional science".
In 1979, the court case "Malnak v Yogi" determined that although SCI/TM is not a theistic religion, it deals with issues of ultimate concern, truth, and other ideas analogous to those in well-recognized religions.
Maharishi biographer Paul Mason suggests that the scientific terminology used in SCI was developed by the Maharishi as part of a restructuring of his philosophies in terms that would gain greater acceptance and increase the number of people starting the TM technique.
He says that this change toward a more academic language was welcomed by many of the Maharishi's American students.
Maharishi effect (1974).
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi claimed that the quality of life would noticeably improve if at least one per cent of the population practised the Transcendental Meditation technique.
This is known as the "Maharishi effect" and according to the Maharishi, it was perceived in 1974 after an analysis of crime statistics in 16 cities.
With the introduction of the TM-Sidhi program including Yogic Flying, the Maharishi proposed that the square root of 1 per cent of the population practising this advanced program together at the same time and in the same place would create benefits in society.
This was referred to as the "Extended Maharishi Effect".
Author Ted Karam claims that there have been numerous studies on the Maharishi effect including a gathering of over 4,000 people in Washington, D.C. in the summer of 1993.
The effect has been examined in 42 scientific studies.
The TM organisation has linked the fall of the Berlin Wall and a reduction in global terrorism, US inflation and crime rates to the Maharishi effect.
The Maharishi effect has been endorsed by the former President of Mozambique Joaquim Chissano.
As the theories proposed by TM practitioners go beyond modern science, the Maharishi effect still lacks a causal basis.
Moreover, the evidence has been said to result from cherry-picked data and the credulity of believers.
Critics, such as James Randi have called this research pseudoscience.
Randi says that he investigated comments made by former Maharishi International University faculty member Robert Rabinoff in 1978.
He spoke to the Fairfield Chief of Police who said local crime levels were the same and the regional Agriculture Department who reportedly deemed that farm yields for Jefferson County matched the state average.
Maharishi Vedic Science (1981).
The Maharishi proclaimed 1981 as the Year of Vedic Science.
It is based on the Maharishi's interpretation of ancient Vedic texts and includes subjective technologies like the Transcendental Meditation technique and the TM-Sidhi program plus programs like Maharishi Sthapatya Veda (MSV) and Maharishi Vedic Astrology (MVA) services which apply Vedic science to day-to-day living.
Vedic science studies the various aspects of life and their relationship to the Veda.
Maharishi Ayurveda.
Maharishi Ayurveda or Maharishi Vedic Medicine is a form of alternative medicine founded in the mid-1980s by Maharishi.
Distinct from traditional ayurveda, it emphasizes the role of consciousness, and gives importance to positive emotions.
Maharishi Ayurveda has been variously characterized as emerging from, and consistently reflecting, the Advaita Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy, representing the entirety of the ayurvedic tradition.
Hitbodedut 
Hitbodedut or hisbodedus (, lit. "seclusion, solitariness, solitude"; Tiberian: "hīṯbōḏăḏūṯ" , Ashkenazi: "hīsboydedēs/hīsboydedūs" or "hīsbōdedūs", Sephardi: "hitbōdedūt") refers to practices of self-secluded Jewish meditation.
The term was popularized by Rebbe Nachman of Breslov (1772–1810) to refer to an unstructured, spontaneous and individualized form of prayer and meditation through which one would establish a close, personal relationship with God and ultimately see the Divinity inherent in all being.
Background.
Secluded meditation practices were encouraged by many medieval rabbis, such as Abraham Maimonides, Abraham Abulafia, Joseph Gikatilla, Moses de Leon, Moses Cordovero, Isaac Luria, and Chaim Vital.
The founder of Hasidism, the Baal Shem Tov, encouraged his close disciples to find deveikus through "hitbodedut and" by meditating on the kabbalistic unifications ("yichudim") of Isaac Luria.
Rebbe Nachman of Breslov also wrote extensively about these practices and claimed that they were practiced by the forefathers of Judaism—Abraham/Avraham, Isaac/Yitzchak, Jacob/Yaakov, Moses/Moshe, David, the prophets, and their students—as well as the Torah leaders of each generation.
Rebbe Nachman's Method.
The method involves talking to God in an intimate, informal manner while secluded in a private setting such as a closed room or a private outdoor setting.
The Rebbe Nachman of Breslov used to teach that one should spend a lot of time in solitude every day: during these moments, which would later turn into semi-prophetic or ecstatic experiences for the knowledge of God and the truth of the Torah, the devout Jew has more opportunities for Teshuvah, due to innovations in the knowledge of the Torah itself, in addition to being a specific meditative modality for personal prayers and "being able to trust God as you would with a friend".
Rebbe Nachman taught that the best place for "hitbodedut" is in the forests or fields.
"When a person meditates in the fields, all the grasses join in his prayer and increase its effectiveness and power," he wrote.
He also suggested practicing "hitbodedut" in the middle of the night, when the desires and lusts of this world are at rest, although doing it during the day is just as effective.
During a session of "hitbodedut", the practitioner pours out his heart to God in his own language, describing all his thoughts, feelings, problems and frustrations.
Nothing was viewed by Rebbe Nachman as being too mundane for discussion, including business dealings, conflicting desires and everyday interactions.
Even the inability to properly articulate what one wishes to say is viewed as a legitimate subject to discuss with God.
One should also use the opportunity to examine his behavior and motivations, correcting the flaws and errors of the past while seeking the proper path for the future.
If one is absolutely unable to speak to God, then Rebbe Nachman advised saying one word with as much strength as possible.
He taught that saying that word over and over again will eventually lead to a breakthrough; God will have compassion on the person and they will eventually be able to express themselves.
Rebbe Nachman told his leading disciple, Reb Noson, that "hitbodedut" should be practiced in a simple, straightforward manner, as if he were conversing with a close friend.
He also advised: 
"It is very good to pour out your thoughts before God like a child pleading before his father.
God calls us His children, as it is written (Deuteronomy 14:1), "You are children to God."
Therefore, it is good to express your thoughts and troubles to God like a child complaining and pestering his father."
Silent meditation.
"Hitbodedut" also lends itself to certain silent meditation techniques.
One is the "silent scream," which Rebbe Nachman himself practiced.
He described the silent scream as follows: 
You can shout loudly in a "small still voice"…
Anyone can do this.
Just imagine the sound of such a scream in your mind.
Depict the shout in your imagination exactly as it would sound.
Keep this up until you are literally screaming with this soundless "small still voice."
This is actually a scream and not mere imagination.
Just as some vessels bring the sound from your lungs to your lips, others bring it to the brain.
You can draw the sound through these nerves, literally bringing it into your head.
When you do this, you are actually shouting inside your brain.
Another form of "hitbodedut" is called "bitul" (nullification), in which the practitioner meditates on God's presence to the exclusion of all other things, including oneself.
"Hitbodedut" is performed in one's mother tongue, in contrast to most other Jewish prayers that are recited in Hebrew.
Rebbe Nachman did not intend for "hitbodedut" to take the place of the three daily prescribed Jewish services, but to supplement them.
He recommended that his followers engage in "hitbodedut" for at least one hour each day.
Hitbodedut is a staple practice for all Breslover Hasidim.
The practice has been much publicized throughout Israel and the Jewish diaspora as a unique form of Jewish meditation, and is practiced by some Jews who are not Breslover Hasidim.
A Christian Reflection on the New Age 
A Christian Reflection on the New Age refers to a six-year study by the Roman Catholic Church on the New Age movement.
The study, published in 2003, is highly critical of the New Age movement and follows the 1989 document "Aspects of Christian meditation", in which the Vatican warned Catholics against mixing Christian meditation with Eastern approaches to spirituality.
The document's title is Jesus Christ, the bearer of the Water of Life.
The document discusses the encounter between Jesus and the Samaritan woman at the well, which it characterizes as "a paradigm for our engagement with truth".
The document considers the New Age based on "weak thought" and emphasizes the differences between Catholic thought and the New Age.
According to the review of the document in "The Tablet", "there is never any doubt in the document that New Age is incompatible with and hostile to the core beliefs of Christianity."
Expressing general agreement with the views expressed by the document, Richard Land, president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, said that there would be widespread agreement among Baptists that New Age ideas are contrary to Christian tradition and doctrine.
Background and overview.
The document was prepared in response to the need expressed by Catholic bishops to have a clear directive about where New Age practices stand with respect to Roman Catholic doctrine.
In response to the requests, the document addresses and provides Christian guidance on New Age phenomena that involve yoga, meditation, feng shui and crystal healing and was published in 2003 as a 90-page booklet titled "A Christian reflection on the New Age".
The document was presented at a February 2003 Vatican conference on "A Christian Reflection on the New Age".
Monsignor Michael Fitzgerald stated at the conference that the "Church avoids any concept that is close to those of the New Age".
Cardinal Paul Poupard, head of the Pontifical Council for Culture, said that the "New Age is a misleading answer to the oldest hopes of man."
Poupard, the Vatican's minister of culture, also warned that the New Age was based on "weak thinking".
The document presents a highly critical view of the New Age movement and considers it as incompatible with and hostile to the core beliefs of Christianity.
The document states that upon close examination it becomes clear that there is little in the New Age that is new, and that for Christians, the "New Age began 2000 years ago, with Christ".
The document also criticizes the New Age movement, stating it is attempting to blur the distinction between good and evil.
By posing the question: "Christ or Aquarius?"
the document states that the New Age often suggests an alternative vision of reality or an alternative way of improving one's current situation by magic.
The document criticizes the view that the Age of Aquarius will replace the Christian Age.
Referring to the Gospel of Luke () that "No servant can be the slave of two masters", it states that Christians have only to think of the difference between the wise men from the East and King Herod to recognize the powerful effects of choice for or against Christ.
The Jesuit magazine "America" commented that the Vatican directive was relevant to Catholic women in religious institutes because there are clear differences between Catholic teachings and the New Age that can become blurred within spiritual practices.
The document was also discussed at June 2004 Vatican conference attended by representatives of the episcopal conferences of 22 countries, as well as members of the Roman Curia.
Following the conference, Alessandro Pennesi, a professor at the Pontifical Lateran University reiterated the Vatican warnings and stated that he agreed with the sentiment that the New Age is based on "ethical relativism" and that it is not possible to "isolate some elements of New Age religiosity as acceptable to Christians, while rejecting others."
Structure and content.
The document has 6 main sections, as well as an appendix, and glossary of New Age terms.
The main sections are: 
New Age places.
The document identifies three allegedly key 'New Age' initiatives that it finds objectionable: Esalen Institute in California, the Findhorn Foundation in Scotland and Monte Verità in Switzerland.
It also mentions the Open Center and the Omega Institute in New York.
The document states that the yearbooks at Monte Verità make it clear that there is an intention to create an "integrated world religion", and that it is fascinating to see the list of people who have gathered over the years at Monte Verità.
Surat Shabd Yoga 
Surat Shabd Simran is a type of spiritual meditation in the Sant Mat tradition.
Etymology.
"Surat" is "attention" or "face", that is, an outward expression of the soul; "Shabd" or "Shabda" has multiple meanings including ‘sacred song’, ‘word’, ‘voice’, ‘hymn’, ‘verse’, or ‘sound current, ‘audible life stream’, and the ‘essence of the Absolute Supreme Being’.
The Absolute Supreme Being is a dynamic force of creative energy sent out into the abyss of space at the dawn of the universe's manifestation, as sound vibrations.
These vibrations continue and are sent forth through the ages, framing all things that constitute and inhabit the universe.
"Yoga" is literally ‘union’, or ‘to yoke’.
Etymologically, "Surat Shabd Yoga" means the ‘Union of the Soul with the Essence of the Absolute Supreme Being’.
"Surat Shabda Yoga" is also known as "Sehaj Yoga" – the path leading to "Sehaj" or equipoise, The Path of Light and Sound, The Path of the "Sants or" 'Saints', The Journey of Soul, and The Yoga of the Sound Current.
Basic principles.
"Surat Shabda Yoga" is for the discovery of "True Self" (Self-Realization), "True Essence" (Spirit-Realization), and "True Divinity" (God-Realization) while living in the human physical body.
This involves reuniting in stages with what is called the "Essence of the Absolute Supreme Being", also known as the "Shabd or Word".
Attaining this extent of self-realization is believed to result in "jivan" "moksha/mukti", which is liberation/release from "samsara" and positivity in the cycle of karma and reincarnation.
Initiation by a contemporary living "Satguru" (Sat - true, Guru - teacher) is considered a prerequisite for successful "sadhana" (spiritual exercises).
The "sadhanas" include "simran" (repetition, particularly silent repetition of a "mantra" given at initiation), "dhyan" (concentration, viewing, or contemplation, particularly on the Inner Master), and "bhajan" (listening to the inner sounds of the "Shabd").
The mantra is Guru Manter.
These are some verbal words that one gets from living masters and chants in mind, not with the mouth.
As the language varies from culture to culture, Guru Manter or Mantra may also vary from culture to culture in spirituality.
On the other hand, Naam or Word of God or Kalma is unspeakable, alive and no one can write it on paper.
In the new testament "Hebrews 4:12" states, "For the Word of God is living and active.
Sharper than any double-edged sword, it pierces even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow.
It judges the thoughts and intentions of the heart."
Words which we write on paper are not alive and active.
According to Scripture, the Word of God has existed since the beginning of the world, prior to any man-made language.
Surat Shabd Yoga arose in India in the last several hundred years, specifically in the Sikh tradition (Nanakpanthi) founded by Guru Nanak.
The practice of meditation (Shabad), which is the central core practice of Surat Shabd Yoga, is derived from the ancient Hindu practice of "nāda yoga".
"Nada yoga" is expounded in various Hindu scriptures such as the Nadabindu Upanishad, an ancient text affiliated with the several thousands-year-old Rig Veda.
The practice of "nāda yoga" within Hinduism has been widely affiliated within many yoga traditions including "bhakti" or devotional yoga, "kundalini" and "tantric yogas", "laya yoga", and "raja yoga".
Modern Hindu teachers still emphasizing "nada yoga" include Swami Sivananda, Swami Rama, Rammurti Mishra (Shri Brahmananda Sarasvati), Paramahansa Yogananda (Kriya Yoga Lineage), and many others.
The practice of "nāda yoga" is an integral part of various other traditions as well, such as being a form of the advanced "thogal" practice in the Tibetan Dzogchen lineage, and is mentioned by H. P. Blavatsky, founder of the Theosophical Society in her book "The Voice of the Silence".
The form of Surat Shabd Yoga, practiced by followers of Sant Mat and the Sikh tradition ("nanakpanthi"), is most commonly related to "nāda yoga".
Furthermore, "nāda yoga" resembles and combines elements from the Hindu practices of "raja yoga", "laya yoga", and "bhakti yoga".
Movements and masters.
Adherents believe Surat Shabda Yoga has been expressed through the movements of many different masters.
However, a basic principle of Surat Shabd Yoga's tradition is the requirement for an outer Living Master to initiate followers onto the Path.
The movements whose historical Satgurus have died and their successors do not purport themselves to be Surat Shabd Yoga Satgurus, usually are not considered currently to be Surat Shabd Yoga movements, either by their own leaders or by movements with current Living Masters.
Satguru Maharshi Mehi Paramahansa Ji Maharaj is considered the movement leader in the 20th century.
He came to an isolated cave of Kuppaghat, Bhagalpur (Bihar, India) and practiced Surat-Shabda Yoga from March 1933 - November 1934.
He achieved self-realization and attained ultimate salvation during his practice.
He wrote books "Moksha-Darshan (Philosophy of Salvation), "Satsang-Yoga", "Shri Gita-Yoga Prakash", "Raamcharit Maanas Saar-Satik", "Maharshi-Mehi-Padaawali" and "Maharshi-Mehi-Padawaali".
The Radha Soami movement of Surat Shabda Yoga was established by Shiv Dayal Singh (1818–1878) in 1861 and named "Radhasoami Satsang" circa 1866.
Soamiji Maharaj, as he was known, presided over the satsang meetings for seventeen years at Panni Gali and Soami Bagh in Agra, India, until he died on June 15, 1878.
Accounts of his guru and successors vary, although he gave verbal instructions on his last day as to how his followers should be cared for.
According to Radha Soami Satsang Beas, his guru was Tulsi Sahib of Hathras.
According to the successors Soami Bagh and Dayal Bagh, Tulsi Sahib was a contemporary guru of the same teachings; but being a natural born Satguru, Seth Shiv Dayal Singh Ji himself had no guru.
After his death, six immediate successors carried on Shiv Dayal Singh’s teachings, including Huzur Maharaj Rai Salig Ram of Peepal Mandi, Agra, and Babaji Maharaj Baba Jaimal Singh of Radha Soami Satsang Beas (RSSB).
More information on living masters related to Seth Shiv Dayal Singh Ji's lineage can be found in the Contemporary Sant Mat movements article.
Sant Kirpal Singh, a contemporary Sant Mat guru, stated that "Naam" ("Word") has been described in many traditions through the use of several different terms.
In his teachings, the following expressions are interpreted as being identical to "Naam": 
The more recently promulgated Quan Yin Method of meditation espoused via the spiritual teachings of Supreme Master Ching Hai has notable similarities to Surat Shabd Yoga.
Eckankar, an American movement, has many links to Surat Shabd Yoga including terminology, although its American founder Paul Twitchell disassociated himself from his former teacher Kirpal Singh.
The Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, also founded in America in 1971 by John-Roger and now with students in thirty-two countries, also teaches a similar form of active meditation called "spiritual exercises".
This movement uses the Sound Current and ancient Sanskrit tones in order to traverse and return to the higher realms of Spirit and into God.
The MasterPath is another contemporary American movement of Surat Shabda Yoga.
Gary Olsen, the current Living Master of this branch, contends that several historical figures are Sat Gurus of Surat Shabda Yoga as representatives for the eternal Inner Shabda Master.
A few of these Living Masters of their times include Lao Tsu, Jesus, Pythagoras, Socrates, Kabir, the Sufi Masters, and mystic poets, Hafez and Rumi, the Ten Sikh Gurus beginning with Guru Nanak, Tulsi Sahib, and the Radhasoami/Radha Soami and offshoot Masters, including Seth Shiv Dayal Singh Ji, Baba Sawan Singh, Baba Faqir Chand, and Sant Kirpal Singh.
The ten Sikh Satgurus (Nanak Panthis) discuss the inner sound and inner light a lot in their scriptures.
The first Sikh Satguru was Guru Nanak, but his master (guru) was Waheguru.
These masters teach these two techniques.
There is a master, Satpal Maharaj, that teaches four techniques that include these two of inner light and inner music.
Altogether He teaches inner light (sight), inner music (hearing), primordial vibration (sense of touch), and nectar (taste and smell).
These correspond to the five senses, and this is how a student turns them inward to experience what is inside of himself.
See Vishnu with his four arms and they correspond to these.
One hand is holding a circle (chakra) of light, one holding a conch shell for the inner sound (hold it to the ear and a sound is heard), one holding a lotus flower to refer to nectar, and finally the fourth hand is holding a metal club (mace) for the inner vibration (if you hit something with it, it vibrates like a tuning fork).
Some people refer to this inner energy as the soul.
The Line of Succession of sikhs.
THE LINE OF SUCCESSION FROM KABIR TO PRESENT  
From Kabir to present, the Masters of the Divine Science of Light and Sound appear and manifest themselves as an uninterrupted line, through which they transmitted to each successor the one knowledge and the one Power.
Subsequently, we can trace an  
exact "family tree" from Kabir Sahib (1398-1518) to Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji (1469-1539) and further as shown below: 
ਹੁਕਮੁ ਪਛਾਨੈ ਸੁ ਏਕੋ ਜਾਨੈ ਬੰਦਾ ਕਹੀਐ ਸੋਈ॥੩॥ (GGSG-Page No.1350-3)...Saint Kabir  
Translation: One who will recognize the Command (Hukam), will know One Lord, we call him the real man.
ਸਚਾ ਸਉਦਾ ਹਰਿ ਨਾਮੁ ਹੈ ਸਚਾ ਵਾਪਾਰਾ ਰਾਮ॥ (GGSG-Page No.570)  
Translation: The True merchandise(ਸਚਾ ਸਉਦਾ) is the Lord`s Naam.
Trader Raam is the truth.
Above line in the book "Guru Granth Sahib Ji" verifies that during the true merchandise (ਸਚਾ ਸਉਦਾ) when Guru Nanak Dev Ji fed the hungry saints and he got the Naam from them.
Whereas in books when we read the history of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, we find no information regarding true merchandise of Word or Naam of God.
This line also verifies that Guru Nanak Dev Ji also interacted with living SattGuru where from he got the Naam.
ਏਕੋ ਨਾਮੁ ਹੁਕਮੁ ਹੈ ਨਾਨਕ ਸਿਤਗੁਿਰ ਦੀਆ ਬੁਝਾਇ ਜੀਉ॥੫॥ (GGSG-Page No.72) ..Guru Nanak  
Translation: The One "Naam" is the Lord's Command, O Nanak, the "True Guru(teacher)" helped me to guess the lamp (light).
ਦੇਹੀ ਅੰਦਰਿ ਨਾਮੁ ਨਿਵਾਸੀ॥ (GGSG-Page No.1026)  
Translation: The Naam or Word or Kalma, abides deep within the body.
This line demonstrates that the Naam of God is something present in the body.
One will get it within his own home i.e body where the spirit lives.
Body is the current home of the spirit.
After Guru Nanak Dev Ji below are the nine SattGurus (i.e Teachers of truth) of the Sikhs who got the success in the history and lead the community of Sikhs:  
Sri Guru Angad Dev Ji (1504-1552),  
Sr Guru Amar Das Ji (1479-1574),  
Sri Guru Ram Das Ji (1534-1581),  
Sri Guru Arjan Dev Ji (1563-1606),  
Sri Guru Har Gobind Sahib Ji (1595-1644),  
Sri Guru Har Rai Sahib Ji (1630-1661),  
Sri Guru Har Krishan Ji (1656-1664),  
Sri Guru Teg Bahadur Ji (1621-1675)  
and Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji (1667-1708).
Variations in movements.
Among the exponents of Surat Shabd Yoga and the commonly shared elements related to the basic principles, notable variations also exist.
For example, the followers of the orthodox Sikh faith no longer lay emphasis on a contemporary living guru.
Different Surat Shabd Yoga paths will vary in the names used to describe the Absolute Supreme Being (God), including Anami Purush (nameless power) and Radha Soami (lord of the soul); the presiding deities and divisions of the macrocosm; the number of outer initiations; the words given as mantras; and the initiation vows or the prerequisites that must be agreed to before being accepted as an initiate.
Contemplative Practices in Action 
Contemplative Practices in Action: Spirituality, Meditation, and Health is an interdisciplinary scholarly and scientific book.
It examines the nature, function, and impact of meditation and other contemplative practices in several different religious traditions, both eastern and western, including methods for incorporating contemplative practice into education, healthcare, and other human services.
Edited by Thomas G. Plante and with a foreword by Huston Smith, the book was published in the United States by Prager in 2010.
The book reviews evidences for health effects and includes 14 chapters divided among three major parts that focus on well-defined systems of practice, traditions as storehouses of many alternative forms of practice, and applications.
It has been reviewed in several professional journals, including "PsycCRITIQUES," and the "Journal of Psychosocial Research".
Topics covered.
The book contains 14 chapters written by scholars in the health and behavioral sciences and religious studies.
Chapter titles and authors are listed in the table ("below, at right").
Huston Smith's foreword describes the book as "ecumenically inclusive," "in line" with Smith's own work.
The editor's introductory chapter notes an increasing usage of meditative practices in health and human service practice, along with an increasing evidence base.
It also acknowledges "a number of books" available on contemplative practices, but expresses concern that 
"almost all [of the existing books] focus on one particular religious or spiritual tradition...
Usually, they highlight the Eastern traditions and overlook the Western ones.".The remaining 13 chapters are divided into three major parts, beginning with  
Part One, which examines well-defined "systems" of contemplative practice, such as Mindfulness-based stress reduction, Passage Meditation, and Centering Prayer.
Part Two describes contemplative practices in Judaism, Islam (especially Sunni Islam), Yoga, and Zen, citing a growing empirical research literature that links better health to research on Yoga, Zen, and Islamic practice.
Part Three emphasizes applications.
Reviews and influence.
Reviews have appeared in "PsycCRITIQUES",  
"Practical Matters", 
the "Journal of Psychosocial Research", 
"Focus on Alternative and Complementary Therapies", 
"Psycho-Oncology", 
and "".
In "PsycCRITIQUES", Edward F. Bourg stated that "in a time full of sensory and information overload, this is a welcome book."
While mindfulness "has entered the popular imagination as a curative factor" for health and well-being, this book shows that many other forms of contemplative practice are also being used successfully.
The book's "twofold" premise is that both Eastern and Western traditions have a contemplative side, and "Doing, not saying, is what counts."
He stated that although generally "the various chapters are very well integrated," the book "isn’t seamless," and some Part III chapters analyze practices, such as lamentation and fire-walking, that "are somewhat unusual... and... would appeal to very few of us."
In "Practical Matters", Eric J. Kyle of the Claremont School of Theology wrote that the book was "a rich source of wisdom [on] the intersection of contemplative practices and... well-being. " providing a "robust introduction to the breadth of contemplative approaches" from "various religious traditions.", although he wondered why there was no coverage of "native or aboriginal spiritualities."
In the "Journal of Psychosocial Research", Uma Gupta of Banaras Hindu University stated that a "strength of this book is its comprehensive identification of issues that are relevant to reducing hypertension in the present era that values speed, productivity and multitasking."
To Gupta, the book provides "excellent summaries of historical roots, current research, directions for future research and general applications of the contemplative practices from Eastern and Western religious and spiritual traditions."
She also described the book as "capable of transforming the life of the reader in making life more meaningful, purposeful and joyful."
In "Focus on Alternative and Complementary Therapies", KJ Sherman wrote that she found the book "unsatisfying," since "for many traditions, the studies reported seemed to focus on religious or mental health outcomes, rather than physical health."
She found "no logic to the traditions included," since they varied greatly in their level of empirical support, and would not recommend the book to healthcare providers or researchers.
However, "the description of the practices themselves" may be useful to "healthcare providers whose patient populations may embrace contemplative practices in the context of multiple spiritual traditions," and to "religious scholars who want to understand how other practices may be similar to those of their tradition."
In "Psycho-Oncology", JL Kristeller stated that "Even those familiar with selected contemplative traditions should find distinctive perspectives," and that the book "lays out a surprising richness of resources related to engaging spiritual well-being though a world heritage of contemplative practices."
In "Choice", G. R. Thursby of the University of Florida wrote that the book was structured into "a meaningful whole that can serve as a tool kit for health care professionals and enable religious leaders to find positive points of contact,".
He stated that "among the best in the book" are the three chapters about Easwaran's Passage Meditation, Keating's Centering Prayer, and Delbecq's meditation program for Silicon Valley leaders.
Contemplation 
In a religious context, the practice of contemplation seeks a direct awareness of the divine which transcends the intellect, often in accordance with prayer or meditation.
Etymology.
The word "contemplation" is derived from the Latin word "contemplatio", ultimately from the Latin word "templum", a piece of ground consecrated for the taking of auspices, or a building for worship.
The latter either derives from the Proto-Indo-European root "*tem-" ("to cut"), on notion of "place reserved or cut out", or from the root *"temp"- ("to stretch, string"), thus referring to a cleared (measured) space in front of an altar.
The Latin word "contemplatio" was used to translate the Greek word "θεωρία" ("theōría").
Greek philosophy.
Contemplation was an important part of the philosophy of Plato; Plato thought that through contemplation, the soul may ascend to knowledge of the Form of the Good or other divine Forms.
Plotinus as a (neo)Platonic philosopher also expressed contemplation as the most critical of components for one to reach henosis.
To Plotinus the highest contemplation was to experience the vision of God, the Monad or the One.
Plotinus describes this experience in his works the Enneads.
According to his student Porphyry, Plotinus stated that he had this experience of God four times.
Plotinus wrote about his experience in Enneads 6.9.
Judaism.
A number of sources have described the importance of contemplation in Jewish traditions, especially in Jewish meditation.
Contemplation was central to the teaching of the Jewish philosopher Maimonides, who taught that contemplating God involves recognizing moral perfection, and that one must interrupt contemplation to attend to the poor.
Contemplation has also been central to the Musar movement.
Islam.
In Islamic tradition, it is said that Muhammad would go into the desert, climb a mountain known as Mount Hira, and seclude himself from the world.
While on the mountain, he would contemplate life and its meaning.
Bahai Faith.
Baha'u'llah and Abdu'l-Baha wrote about contemplation and meditation in regards to reflecting on beauty, the Kingdom of God, science, and the arts.
Abdu'l-Baha stated that "the sign of the intellect is contemplation and the sign of contemplation is silence... he cannot both speak and meditate".
Christianity.
In Eastern Christianity, contemplation (theoria) literally means to see God or to have the Vision of God.
The state of beholding God, or union with God, is known as theoria.
The process of Theosis which leads to that state of union with God known as theoria is practiced in the ascetic tradition of Hesychasm.
Hesychasm is to reconcile the heart and the mind into one thing (see nous).
Contemplation in Eastern Orthodoxy is expressed in degrees as those covered in St John Climacus' Ladder of Divine Ascent.
The process of changing from the old man of sin into the newborn child of God and into our true nature as good and divine is called Theosis.
This is to say that once someone is in the presence of God, deified with him, then they can begin to properly understand, and there "contemplate" God.
This form of contemplation is to have and pass through an actual experience rather than a rational or reasoned understanding of theory (see Gnosis).
Whereas with rational thought one uses logic to understand, one does the opposite with God (see also Apophatic theology).
The anonymously authored 14th century English contemplative work "The Cloud of Unknowing" makes clear that its form of practice is not an act of the intellect, but a kind of transcendent 'seeing,' beyond the usual activities of the mind - "The first time you practice contemplation, you'll experience a darkness, like a cloud of unknowing.
You won't know what this is... this darkness and this cloud will always be between you and your God... they will always keep you from seeing him clearly by the light of understanding in your intellect and will block you from feeling Him fully in the sweetness of love in your emotions.
So be sure to make your home in this darkness...
We can't think our way to God... that's why I'm willing to abandon everything I know, to love the one thing I cannot think.
He can be loved, but not thought."
Within Western Christianity contemplation is often related to mysticism as expressed in the works of mystical theologians such as Teresa of Avila and John of the Cross as well as the writings of Margery Kempe, Augustine Baker and Thomas Merton.
Dom Cuthbert Butler notes that contemplation was the term used in the Latin Church to refer to mysticism, and "'mysticism' is a quite modern word".
Meditation.
In Christianity, contemplation refers to a content-free mind directed towards the awareness of God as a living reality.
Meditation, on the other hand, for many centuries in the Western Church, referred to more cognitively active exercises, such as visualizations of Biblical scenes as in the Ignatian exercises or "lectio divina" in which the practitioner "listens to the text of the Bible with the 'ear of the heart', as if he or she is in conversation with God, and God is suggesting the topics for discussion."
In Catholic Christianity, contemplation is given importance.
The Catholic Church's "model theologian", St. Thomas Aquinas wrote: "It is requisite for the good of the human community that there should be persons who devote themselves to the life of contemplation."
("Sentences") One of his disciples, Josef Pieper commented: "For it is contemplation which preserves in the midst of human society the truth which is at one and the same time useless and the yardstick of every possible use; so it is also contemplation which keeps the true end in sight, gives meaning to every practical act of life."
Pope John Paul II in the Apostolic Letter "Rosarium Virginis Mariae" referred specifically to the catholic devotion of the Holy Rosary as "an exquisitely contemplative prayer" and said that "By its nature the recitation of the Rosary calls for a quiet rhythm and a lingering pace, helping the individual to meditate on the mysteries of the Lord's life as seen through the eyes of her who was closest to the Lord.
In this way the unfathomable riches of these mysteries are disclosed."
According to Aquinas, the highest form of life is the contemplative which communicates the fruits of contemplation to others, since it is based on the abundance of contemplation ("contemplari et contemplata aliis tradere") (ST, III, Q. 40, A. 1, Ad 2).
Meditation (writing) 
A meditation (derived from the Latin "meditatio", from a verb "meditari", meaning "to think, contemplate, devise, ponder") is a written work or a discourse intended to express its author's reflections, or to guide others in contemplation.
Often they are an author's musings or extended thoughts on deeper philosophical or religious questions.
In the case of Marcus Aurelius, writing was therapeutic.
He would use writing as a form of therapy, often aiming to write short and memorable paragraphs.
Meditation, as form of writing, is a type of reflective writing.
Often, writings in this style are a form of meditation.
Writing, just like meditation, is a form of interfering with one's mind for beneficial purposes.
Just like meditation writing deliberately focuses one's mind on the task at hand, restructuring your conscious thoughts.
This idea can very clearly be viewed in Descartes' "Meditations".
In "Meditations" Descartes hopes to have his readers follow along in Meditational exercises.
As such, he hopes to have readers read the entire "Meditations", rather than just a part, explaining that he wants people reading it to be in serious deliberation.
Descartes's "Meditations" offer particular insight into this style of writing, letting us know that meditations is meant to delve into the various aspects of self, and our ideas of ourselves.
Often, he is seen as examining the seemingly unconscious ideas of the mind, and bringing them to consciousness.
Thereby clarifying ideas in one's own head.
Meditations, according to Descartes, are not meant to be an idle task but rather something that should go on to affect all aspects of life: from social interactions, to how we perceive ourselves.
Despite the being Descartes perceptions of meditations there are other varieties.
Some view meditations more like writing therapy, a way to vent out and deal with one's emotions, whereas Descartes and the stoics viewed meditations as a form of contemplation, as mentioned above.
Examples of meditations are: 
Mindfulness-based stress reduction 
Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is an eight-week evidence-based program that offers secular, intensive mindfulness training to assist people with stress, anxiety, depression and pain.
Developed at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in the 1970s by Professor Jon Kabat-Zinn, MBSR uses a combination of mindfulness meditation, body awareness, yoga and exploration of patterns of behaviour, thinking, feeling and action.
Mindfulness can be understood as the non-judgmental acceptance and investigation of present experience, including body sensations, internal mental states, thoughts, emotions, impulses and memories, in order to reduce suffering or distress and to increase well-being.
Mindfulness meditation is a method by which attention skills are cultivated, emotional regulation is developed, and rumination and worry are significantly reduced.
During the past decades, mindfulness meditation has been the subject of more controlled clinical research, which suggests its potential beneficial effects for mental health, as well as physical health.
While MBSR has its roots in Buddhist wisdom teachings, the program itself is secular.
The MBSR program is described in detail in Kabat-Zinn's 1990 book "Full Catastrophe Living."
History.
In 1979, Jon Kabat-Zinn founded the Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, and nearly twenty years later the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care and Society at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.
Both these institutions supported the growth and implementation of MBSR into hospitals worldwide.
Kabat-Zinn described the MBSR program in detail in his bestselling 1990 book "Full Catastrophe Living," which was reissued in a revised edition in 2013"."
In 1993, the MBSR course taught by Jon Kabat-Zinn was featured in Bill Moyer's Healing from Within.
In the year 2015, close to 80% of medical schools are reported to offer some element of mindfulness training, and research and education centers dedicated to mindfulness have proliferated.
Program.
A meta-analysis described MBSR as "a group program that focuses upon the progressive acquisition of mindful awareness, of mindfulness".
The MBSR program is an eight-week workshop taught by certified trainers that entails weekly group meetings (2.5 hour classes) and a one-day retreat (seven-hour mindfulness practice) between sessions six and seven, homework (45 minutes daily), and instruction in three formal techniques: mindfulness meditation, body scanning and simple yoga postures.
Group discussions and exploration - of experience of the meditation practice and its application to life - is a central part of the program.
Body scanning is the first prolonged formal mindfulness technique taught during the first four weeks of the course, and entails quietly sitting or lying and systematically focusing one's attention on various regions of the body, starting with the toes and moving up slowly to the top of the head.
MBSR is based on non-judging, non-striving, acceptance, letting go, beginners mind, patience, trust, and non-centering.
According to Kabat-Zinn, the basis of MBSR is mindfulness, which he defined as "moment-to-moment, non-judgmental awareness."
During the program, participants are asked to focus on informal practice as well by incorporating mindfulness into their daily routines.
Focusing on the present is thought to heighten sensitivity to the environment and one’s own reactions to it, consequently enhancing self-management and coping.
It also provides an outlet from ruminating on the past or worrying about the future, breaking the cycle of these maladaptive cognitive processes.
The validity and reliability of a weekly single-item practice quality assessment have been confirmed by research.
Increases in practice quality predicted improvements in self-report mindfulness and psychological symptoms but not behavioral mindfulness, and longer practice sessions were linked to better practice quality.
Scientific evidence of the debilitating effects of stress on human body and its evolutionary origins were pinpointed by the work of Robert Sapolsky, and explored for lay readers in the book "Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers".
Engaging in mindfulness meditation brings about significant reductions in psychological stress, and appears to prevent the associated physiological changes and biological clinical manifestations that happen as a result of psychological stress.
According to early neuroimaging studies, MBSR training has an influence on the areas of the brain responsible for attention, introspection, and emotional processing.
Extent of practice.
According to a 2014 article in "Time" magazine, mindfulness meditation is becoming popular among people who would not normally consider meditation.
The curriculum started by Kabat-Zinn at University of Massachusetts Medical Center has produced nearly 1,000 certified MBSR instructors who are in nearly every state in the US and more than 30 countries.
Corporations such as General Mills have made MBSR instruction available to their employees or set aside rooms for meditation.
Democratic Congressman Tim Ryan published a book in 2012 titled "A Mindful Nation" and he has helped organize regular group meditation periods on Capitol Hill.
Methods of practice.
Mindfulness-based stress reduction classes and programs are offered by various facilities including hospitals, retreat centers, and various yoga facilities.
Typically the programs focus on teaching 
Evaluation of effectiveness.
Mindfulness-based approaches have been found to be beneficial for healthy adults for adolescents and children, healthcare professionals, as well as for different health-related outcomes including eating disorders, psychiatric conditions, pain management sleep disorders, cancer care, psychological distress, and for coping with health-related conditions.
As a major subject of increasing research interest, 52 papers were published in 2003, rising to 477 by 2012.
Nearly 100 randomized controlled trials had been published by early 2014.
The development of therapies to improve individuals' flexibility in switching between using and not using emotion regulation (ER) methods is necessary because it is linked to better mental health, wellbeing, and resilience.
According to research, those who attended MBSR training exhibited greater regulatory decision flexibility.
In post-secondary students, research on mindfulness-based stress reduction has demonstrated that it can reduce psychological distress, which is common in this age range.
In one study, the long-term impact of an 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) treatment extended to two months after the intervention was completed.
Individuals with eating disorders have benefited from the mindfulness-based approach.
MBSR therapy has been found to assist individuals improve the way they view their bodies.
Interventions, such as mindfulness-based approaches, which focus on effective coping skills and improving one’s relationship with themselves through increased self-compassion can positively impact a person’s body image and contribute to overall well-being.
Research suggests mindfulness training improves focus, attention, and ability to work under stress.
Mindfulness may also have potential benefits for cardiovascular health.
Evidence suggests efficacy of mindfulness meditation in the treatment of substance use disorders.
Mindfulness training may also be beneficial for people with fibromyalgia.
In addition, recent research has explored the ability of mindfulness-based stress reduction to increase self-compassion and enhance the well-being of those who are caregivers, specifically mothers, for youth struggling with substance use disorders.
Mindfulness-based interventions allowed for the mothers to experience a decrease in stress as well as a better relationship with themselves which resulted in improved interpersonal relationships.
It has been demonstrated that mindfulness-based stress reduction has beneficial impacts on healthy individuals as well as suffering individuals and those close to suffering individuals.
Roca et al. (2019) conducted an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program for healthy participants.
Five pillars of MBSR, including mindfulness, compassion, psychological well-being, psychological distress, and emotional-cognitive control were identified.
Participants psychological functioning were examined and assessed using questionnaires.
Mindfulness and overall well-being was significant between the five pillars observed.
Mindfulness-based interventions and their impact have become prevalent in every-day life, especially when rooted in an academic setting.
After interviewing children, of the average age of 11, it was apparent that mindfulness had contributed to their ability to regulate their emotions.
In addition to these findings, these children expressed that the more mindfulness was incorporated by their school and teachers, the easier it was to apply its principles.
Mindfulness-based stress approaches have been shown to increase self-compassion.
Higher levels of self-compassion have been found to greatly reduce stress.
In addition, as self-compassion increases it seems as though self-awareness increases as well.
This finding has been observed to occur during treatment as well as a result at the conclusion, and even after, treatment.
Self-compassion is both a result and an informative factor of the effectiveness of mindfulness-based approaches.
MBIs (mindfulness-based intervations) showed a positive effect on mental and somatic health in social when compared to other active treatments in adults.
These effects are largely independent of gender, study sample, duration and compliance with the MBSR intervention.
Abbey of the Holy Ghost 
The Abbey of the Holy Ghost is a medieval prose allegory, ca. 1350–1375.
The text is preserved in at least 26 manuscripts, often followed by the "Charter of the Abbey of the Holy Ghost".
The text advises lay women on how to live a contemplative life outside a monastery; the companion "Charter" speaks of the fall and salvation.
The most recent edition "The Charter of the Abbey of the Holy Ghost", was released in 1975 by University Microfilms International.
Transcendental Meditation technique 
The Transcendental Meditation technique (abbreviated as TM) is the technique associated with the practice of Transcendental Meditation developed by the Indian spiritual figure Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.
The practice involves the use of a private mantra, and is practised for 20 minutes twice per day while sitting comfortably with one's eyes closed.
Unlike some other approaches to meditation, TM instruction encourages students not to be alarmed by random thoughts which may arise, but to easily return to the mantra when one becomes aware of this.
Advocates of TM claim that the technique promotes a state of relaxed awareness, stress-relief, creativity, and efficiency, as well as physiological benefits such as reducing the risk of heart disease and high blood pressure.
The technique is purported to allow practitioners to experience higher states of consciousness.
Advanced courses supplement the TM technique with the TM-Sidhi program.
The methodological quality of scientific research on the therapeutic benefits of meditation in general is poor, because of the varying theoretical approaches and frequent confirmation bias in individual studies.
A 2012 meta-analysis published in "Psychological Bulletin", which reviewed 163 individual studies, found that Transcendental Meditation produced superior results in "reducing negative emotions, trait anxiety, and neuroticism" as well as improving "learning and memory" by comparison with other meditation approaches.
The same study found that these analyses were "mostly conducted by members of the Maharishi International University".
A 2014 Cochrane review of four trials found that it was impossible to draw any conclusions about whether TM is effective in preventing cardiovascular disease, as the scientific literature on TM was limited and at "serious risk of bias".
However, a 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 studies found that TM may effectively reduce blood pressure compared to control groups.
Practice.
The technique is recommended for 20 minutes twice per day.
According to the Maharishi, "bubbles of thought are produced in a stream one after the other", and the Transcendental Meditation technique consists of experiencing a "proper thought" in its more subtle states "until its subtlest state is experienced and transcended".
Because it is mantra based, the technique "ostensibly meets the working definition of a concentration practice"; however, the TM organisation says that "focused attention" is not prescribed, and that the "aim is a unified and open attentional stance".
Other authors describe the technique as an easy, natural technique or process, and a "wakeful hypometabolic physiologic state".
Practice of the technique includes a process called "unstressing" which combines "effortless relaxation with spontaneous imagery and emotion".
TM teachers caution their students not to be alarmed by random thoughts and to "attend" to the mantra.
Scottish chess grandmaster Jonathan Rowson has said that his TM practice gives "a feeling of serenity, energy and balance", but does not provide "any powerful insight into your own mind".
Laura Tenant, a reporter for "The Independent", said that her TM experience includes going "to a place which was neither wakefulness, sleeping or dreaming", and becoming "detached from my physical self".
Worldwide, four to six million people over the decade 2003 to 2013 have been reported to be practitioners.
Mantra.
The TM technique consists of silently repeating a mantra with "gentle effortlessness" while sitting comfortably with eyes closed and without assuming any special yoga position.
The mantra is said to be a vehicle that allows the individual's attention to travel naturally to a less active, quieter style of mental functioning.
TM meditators are instructed to keep their mantra secret to ensure maximum results, to avoid confusion in the mind of the meditators, and as a "protection against inaccurate teaching".
Selection.
The Maharishi is reported to have standardised and "mechanized" the mantra selection process by using a specific set of mantras and making the selection process "foolproof".
Professor of psychiatry Norman E. Rosenthal writes that during the training given by a certified TM teacher, "each student is assigned a specific mantra or sound, with instructions on its proper use".
The Maharishi said that the selection of a proper thought or mantra "becomes increasingly important when we consider that the power of thought increases when the thought is appreciated in its infant stages of development".
He said that mantras chosen for initiates should "resonate to the pulse of his thought and as it resonates, create an increasingly soothing influence", and that the chosen mantra's vibrations "harmonize" with the meditator and suit his/her "nature and way of life".
Author George D. Chryssides writes that according to the Maharishi, "using just any mantra can be dangerous"; the mantras for "householders" and for recluses differ.
According to Chryssides, many mantras – such as "Om" – commonly found in books are mantras for recluses and "can cause a person to withdraw from life".
Former TM teacher and author Lola Williamson reports that she told her TM students that their mantra was chosen for them based on their personal interview, while sociologist Roy Wallis and religious scholar J. Gordon Melton write that the mantras are assigned by age and gender.
In 1984, 16 mantras were published in "Omni" magazine based on information from "disaffected TM teachers".
According to Chryssides, TM teachers say that the promised results are dependent on a trained Transcendental Meditation teacher choosing the mantra for their student.
Meaning and sound value.
In his 1963 book "The Science of Being and Art of Living", the Maharishi writes that words create waves of vibrations, and the quality of vibration of a mantra should correspond to the vibrational quality of the individual.
Likewise, religious studies scholar Thomas Forsthoefel writes, "the theory of mantras is the theory of sound".
Author William Jefferson writes that the "euphonics" of mantras are important.
Sociologist Stephen J. Hunt and others say that the mantra used in the Transcendental Meditation technique "has no meaning", but that "the sound itself" is sacred.
In Kerala, India, in 1955, the Maharishi spoke of mantras in terms of personal deities, and according to religious studies scholar Cynthia Ann Humes, similar references can be found in his later works.
According to authors Peter Russell and Norman Rosenthal, the sounds used in the technique are taken from the ancient Vedic tradition, have "no specific meaning", and are selected for their suitability for the individual.
Nevertheless, the Maharishi mentions that sometimes it is beneficial for the Mantra to be associated with a specific meaning in order to suit one's own private psychological background.
Author Lola Williamson writes that the bija, or seed mantras, used in TM come from the Tantric, rather than Vedic tradition, and that bija mantras are "traditionally associated with particular deities and used as a form of worship".
According to Needleman, many mantras come from the Vedas or Vedic hymns, which are "the root for all later Hindu scripture", while the 1977 court case Malnak vs. Yogi accepted the TM mantras as meaningless sounds.
Likewise, philosophy of science scholar and former Maharishi International University professor Jonathan Shear writes in his book "The Experience of Meditation: Experts Introduce the Major Traditions" that the mantras used in the TM technique are independent of meaning associated with any language, and are used for their mental sound value alone.
Fred Travis of the Maharishi University of Management writes in a 2009 article published in the "International Journal of Psychophysiology" that "unlike most mantra meditations, any possible meaning of the mantra is not part of Transcendental Meditation practice".
Courses.
The Transcendental Meditation technique is taught in a standardised seven-step course over six days by a certified TM teacher.
Except for a requirement to refrain from using non-prescription drugs for 15 days before learning TM, all who want to learn are taught provided they can pay the course fee which , ranges from $420 for students to $980 for members of households with incomes of $200,000 or more.
The technique is taught via private and group instruction by a TM teacher trained to instruct students and provide follow up.
Instruction is given on separate days, beginning with a one-hour "introductory lecture" intended to prepare the student for subsequent steps.
The lecture discusses mind potential, social relationships, health, and "promoting inner and outer peace".
The second step is a 45-minute "preparatory lecture", whose topic is the theory of the practice, its origins and its relationship to other types of meditation.
This is followed by the third step: a private, ten-minute, personal interview, allowing the TM teacher to get acquainted with the student and answer questions.
According to the TM web site, the personal instruction session takes 1–2 hours, and students are required to bring a clean handkerchief, some flowers and fruit, and their course fee.
The initiation begins with a short puja ceremony performed by the teacher.
The stated purpose of the ceremony is to show honour and gratitude to the lineage of TM "masters", or "Holy Tradition" that is listed in the Maharishi's translation and commentary of the Bhagavad-Gita.
It is regarded as putting students in the right frame of mind to receive the mantra.
The ceremony is conducted in a private room with a "little" white altar containing incense, camphor, rice, flowers and a picture of Maharishi's teacher, Guru Dev.
The initiate observes passively as the teacher recites a text in Sanskrit.
After the ceremony, the "meditators" are "invited to bow", receive their mantra and begin to meditate.
On the day after the personal instruction session, the student begins a series of three 90-to-120-minute "teaching sessions", held on three consecutive days, called "three days of checking".
Their stated purpose is to "verify the correctness of the practice" and to receive further instruction.
The first day's checking meeting takes place in a group on the day following personal instruction, and gives information about correct practice based on each student's own experience.
The second day of checking uses the same group format, and gives more details of the mechanics of the practice and potential results of the practice, based on student experiences.
The third day of checking focuses on subjective growth and the potential development of higher stages of human consciousness, and outlines the follow-up programs available as part of the course.
New meditators later return for private follow-up sessions to confirm that they are practising the technique properly, a process called "personal checking".
The preferred schedule for follow-up classes is 30 minutes, once per week for one month, and once per month thereafter.
The purpose of the follow-up, or "checking sessions", is to verify the practice, give an opportunity for one-on-one contact with a TM teacher, and to address any problems or questions.
Course graduates may access a lifetime follow-up program which includes consultations, "refresher courses", advanced lectures and group meditations.
Advanced courses include weekend Residence Courses and the TM-Sidhi program.
According to the TM organisation, TM course fees cover "initial training and the lifetime follow-up" program, while helping to "build and maintain TM centers" and schools in India and around the world.
The fees also reportedly provide TM scholarships for special-needs groups, as well as grants and scholarships through TM's Maharishi Foundation, a government-approved 501(c)(3) non-profit, educational organisation.
The fees may "vary from country to country", depending on the cost of living, and have changed periodically during the 50-year period that the course has been taught.
The Maharishi has drawn criticism from yogis and "stricter Hindus" who have accused him of selling "commercial mantras".
At the same time, the Maharishi's "promises of better health, stress relief and spiritual enlightenment" have drawn "devotees from all over the world", despite the fees.
According to "The Complete Idiot's Guide to World Religions", by Brandon Toropov and Father Luke Buckles, insistence on fees for TM instruction has caused critics to question the Maharishi's motives; however, "the movement is not, to all appearances, an exploitive one".
TM-Sidhi program.
The TM-Sidhi program is a form of meditation introduced by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in 1975.
It is based on, and described as a natural extension of the Transcendental Meditation technique.
The goal of the TM-Sidhi program is to accelerate personal growth and improve mind–body coordination by training the mind to think from what the Maharishi has described as a fourth major state of consciousness called Transcendental Consciousness.
Yogic Flying, a mental-physical exercise of hopping while cross-legged, is a central aspect of the TM-Sidhi program.
With the introduction of the TM-Sidhi program in 1976, it was postulated that a group of people practising the TM-Sidhi program twice a day, together in one place, would increase "life-supporting trends" in the surroundings, with the threshold for the group size being the square root of 1% of the area's population.
This was called the "Extended Maharishi Effect", referring to the "Maharishi effect" with a threshold of 1% of the population.
These effects have been examined in 14 published studies, including a gathering of over 4,000 people in Washington DC in the summer of 1993.
While empirical studies have been published in peer-reviewed academic journals this research remains controversial and has been characterised as pseudoscience by sceptics James Randi, Carl Sagan, and others.
Teachers.
The Maharishi began training TM teachers in the early 1960s, and by 1978, there were 7,000 TM teachers in the United States.
In 1985, there were an estimated 10,000 TM teachers worldwide, and by 2003, there were 20,000 teachers, and a reported 40,000 teachers in 2008.
Notable individuals trained to teach the Transcendental Meditation technique include Prudence Farrow, John Gray, Mitch Kapor, and Mike Love.
The first teacher training course was held in India with 30 participants in 1967 and 200 participants in 1970.
A four-month teacher training course was also held in the United States that year.
The first part was four weeks long and was offered in both Poland, Maine and Humboldt, California with the final three months being held in Estes Park, Colorado.
About 300 people completed the training.
In 1973, the TM teacher training course consisted of three months in-residence.
A 2007 TM web page and 2009 book, report that the TM teacher training course in more modern times consists of six months in-residence, and includes courses in Maharishi Vedic Science, extended meditation practice and becoming the "custodian" for an "ancient Vedic tradition".
Additionally, TM teachers are trained to speak on the Transcendental Meditation program, teach it to others, provide "personal checking" of their students' meditation, create lectures on related topics, organise and lead advanced TM courses and programs.
The Maharishi trained his teachers to "make logical presentations in language suitable to their audiences", and teachers lead their students through a sequence of predetermined steps.
A 2007 research study reported that details of the training and knowledge imparted to teachers are kept private.
In 1976, Janis Johnson wrote in "The Christian Century" that TM teachers sign a "loyalty-oath employment contract", saying "It is my fortune, Guru Dev, that I have been accepted to serve the Holy Tradition and spread the Light of God to all those who need it."
Author William Bainbridge writes that a section of a training bulletin for TM teachers called "Explanations of the Invocation" draws a "connection to Brahma, the Lord of Creation".
A 1993 article in the "Ottawa Citizen" reported a partial translation of the puja as "Whosoever remembers the lotus-eyed Lord gains inner and outer purity.
To Lord Naryan, to Lotus-born Brahman the creator, to Vaishistha, to Shakti, to Shankaracharya the emancipator, hailed as Krishna, to the Lord I bow down and down again.
At whose door the whole galaxy of gods pray for perfection day and night".
Research.
Scientists have been conducting research on meditation, including TM, since the late 1960s and hundreds of studies have been published.
Transcendental Meditation has become one of the most widely researched meditation techniques.
TM research has played a role in the history of mind–body medicine and encouraged neuroscience research focusing on the effects of meditation.
Early studies examined the physiological parameters of meditation.
Subsequent research included clinical applications, cognitive effects, mental health, medical costs, and rehabilitation.
Beginning in the 1990s, research focused on cardiovascular disease.
Research reviews of the effects of the Transcendental Meditation technique have yielded results ranging from inconclusive to clinically significant.
More research is needed to determine the therapeutic effects of meditation practices and sources vary regarding their assessment of the quality of research.
Some cite design limitations and a lack of methodological rigour, while others assert that the quality is improving and that when suitable assessment criteria are applied, scientific evidence supports the therapeutic value of meditation.
Reviewers Canter and Ernst assert that some studies have the potential for bias due to the connection of researchers to the TM organisation while TM researchers point to their collaboration with independent researchers and universities as signs of objectivity.
Institutional programs.
In schools and universities.
Transcendental Meditation in education (also known as Consciousness-Based Education) is the application of the Transcendental Meditation technique in an educational setting or institution.
These educational programs and institutions have been founded in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, India, Africa and Japan.
The Transcendental Meditation technique became popular with students in the 1960s and by the early 1970s centers for the Students International Meditation Society were established at a thousand campuses in the United States with similar growth occurring in Germany, Canada and Britain.
The Maharishi International University was established in 1973 in the United States and began offering accredited degree programs.
In 1977 courses in Transcendental Meditation and the Science of Creative Intelligence (SCI) were banned from New Jersey public high schools on religious grounds by virtue of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.
This "dismantled" the TM program's use of government funding in US public schools but "did not constitute a negative evaluation of the program itself".
Since 1979, schools that incorporate the Transcendental Meditation technique using private, non-governmental funding have been reported in the United States, South America, Southeast Asia, Northern Ireland, South Africa and Israel.
A number of educational institutions have been founded by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the Transcendental Meditation movement and its supporters.
These institutions include several schools offering public and private secondary education in the United States (Maharishi School of the Age of Enlightenment), England (Maharishi School), Australia (Maharishi School), South Africa (Maharishi Invincibility School of Management), and India (Maharishi Vidya Mandir Schools).
Likewise, Maharishi colleges and universities have been established including Maharishi European Research University (Netherlands), Maharishi Institute of Management (India), Maharishi University of Management and Technology (India), Maharishi Institute (South Africa) and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi Vedic University (India).
According to an article in Newsweek, "critics believe that TM is a repackaged form of Eastern religious philosophy" and opposed its use in public schools while a member of the Pacific Justice Institute says practising Transcendental Meditation in public schools with private funding is constitutional.
Corporate programs.
Transcendental Meditation has been utilised in corporations, both in the United States and in India, under the auspices of the and the Maharishi Development Corporation.
As of 2001, US companies such as General Motors and IBM were subsidising the TM course fee for their employees.
A number of Indian companies provide the TM technique to their managers.
These companies include AirTel, Siemens, American Express, SRF Limited, Wipro, Hero Honda, Ranbaxy, Hewlett Packard, BHEL, BPL Group, ESPN Star Sports, Tisco, Eveready, Maruti, Godrej Group and Marico.
The "Sunday Times Herald" reports that there are more than 100 Japanese companies where TM was introduced at induction.
Social programs.
The TM technique has been incorporated in US social programs for criminals, the homeless and war veterans.
In 1979, it was offered to inmates at Folsom prison, San Quentin and the Deuel Vocational Institute.
According to a TM representative, meditation has been included at "over 25 prisons and correctional institutions" in the United States.
In Senegal, more than 11,000 prisoners and 900 correctional officers in 34 prisons received instruction in TM between 1985 and 1987, and the wardens at 31 prisons signed a proclamation recommending that TM be offered throughout the entire system.
More recently, the TM technique has been introduced to prisoners in the Oregon Correctional System and a research study is underway to record the effects of the program.
Since the late 1980s the TM technique has been offered as part of the programs at Fundacion Hogares Claret sanctuary for homeless and orphaned children in Medellin, Colombia.
In 1996, several judges of the 22nd Judicial Circuit of St Louis, Missouri, began ordering convicted felons to attend a TM course as one of their conditions for parole.
The program was administered by the non-profit Enlightened Sentencing Project and received endorsements from federal judge Henry Autrey and other members of the Missouri district, federal, and supreme courts.
In 2010, the Doe Fund of New York City began offering the TM technique to its residents, and homeless men were given instruction in the TM technique through an organisation called "Ready, Willing and Able".
In 2010, the Superintendent of Prisons announced that the TM technique was being offered to inmates at the Dominica State Prison.
In 2011, the technique was taught to about 65 individuals at the Children of the Night shelter for teen prostitutes in Los Angeles.
Psychiatry professor Norman E. Rosenthal says that TM is compatible with "most drug treatment approaches" and could be incorporated into an overall treatment program.
Military.
TM was first employed by the military in 1985, when the US Armed Forces conducted "a small pilot study" on Vietnam veterans.
The Transcendental Meditation technique was taught to military personnel with post traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) as part of two research studies conducted at the University of Colorado and Georgetown University in 2010.
In 2012, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced that it was "studying the use of transcendental meditation to help returning veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars" and the Department of Defense funded a $2.4 million grant to Maharishi University of Management Research Institute and the San Diego Veterans Administration Medical Center to further investigate the potential effect of the TM technique on PTSD.
Other initiatives to teach the TM technique to war veterans at risk for PTSD, were underway as of 2010.
The technique has been taught to students at Norwich University, a private military academy, as "part of a long-term study" on meditation and military performance.
Characterizations.
Characterizations of the TM technique vary amongst scholars, clergy, practitioners and governments.
According to the Maharishi his technique requires no preparation, is simple to do, and can be learned by anyone.
The technique is described as effortless and without contemplation or concentration Author Peter Russell says trying to control the mind is like trying to go to sleep at night, it won't work.
He says instead, the TM technique utilises the tendency of the mind to move towards greater satisfaction.
According to TM advocates, the technique is "purely a mechanical, physiological process", the "two-minute ceremony" invokes no deities, the mantras are "sounds without meaning" and the technique "pre-dates Hinduism by 5,000 years".
Anthony Campbell, author of the book "Seven States of Consciousness", writes that TM requires no "special circumstances or preparations" and does "not depend upon belief".
A 2011 article in "Details" characterises the TM technique as a "Hindu meditation practice ["stripped"] of its religious baggage" offered "as a systematic, stress-reducing, creativity-building technique".
Martin Gardner, a mathematician, has referred to TM as "the Hindu cult".
According to author R.S. Bajpai, the Maharishi "secularized the TM ["sic"] by purging it of all the religious rites and rituals and spiritual mysticism".
By religious leaders.
Some religious leaders and clergy find TM to be compatible with their religious teachings and beliefs, while others do not.
Wayne Teasdale, a Catholic monk, said that TM "is what is called an open or receptive method" that can be described as giving up control and remaining open in an inner sense.
In 1968, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Michael Ramsey, "came to the support of Maharishi's theory".
William Jefferson wrote in 1976 that a Jewish Revivalist had called TM "an insidious form of worship" while Trappist monks in Spencer, Massachusetts, had found it useful.
In 1984, Cardinal Jaime Sin, the Archbishop of Manila, wrote a pastoral statement after Ferdinand Marcos, then president of the Philippines, invited more than 1,000 members of the TM movement to Manila, saying that neither the doctrine nor the practice of TM is acceptable to Christians.
In 2003, the Roman Curia published a warning against mixing eastern meditations, such as TM, with Christian prayer, though a 2013 statement suggests that eastern meditations can be useful.
Clergy who practice the TM technique and find it compatible with their religious beliefs include: Catholic priest Len Dubi; Orthodox rabbi Abe Shainberg; Irish Jesuit William Johnston; Donald Craig Drummond, a Presbyterian minister; Raphael Levine, the emeritus rabbi of Temple De Hirsh Sinai; Placide Gaboury, a Jesuit priest who teaches at the University of Sudbury; Kevin Joyce, a Catholic priest; and Keith Wollard, a United Church minister.
By laypersons.
Lay celebrities who have practised the technique include David Lynch, who was raised a Presbyterian, and Clint Eastwood who says he found "there were no religious aspects", comedian Andy Kaufman, political commentator and Roman Catholic Andrew Sullivan, Jerry Seinfeld, who has been practising the technique for 40 years, and Pulitzer Prize winning music critic Tim Page.
Once asked if TM could substitute for religion, musician George Harrison replied that "It's not a substitute for religion.
It is a religion."
According to John Lennon, "You can make it with meditation if you're a Christian, a Mohammedan or a Jew.
You just add meditation to whatever religion you've got."
By scholars.
The technique has been variously described by sociologists and religious scholars as religious and non-religious.
Its adherents says it is a non-religious, "scientific strategy", yet it appears to have "spiritual elements" such as the puja ceremony performed during the TM instruction.
Religious studies scholar Eugene V. Gallagher writes that, "practitioners describe TM as a science rather than a religious discipline", but its "principles were clearly derived from Hindu practice".
In the book "Cults and New Religious Movements", author Roy Wallis characterises TM as a "world affirming new religion" that "lacks most of the features traditionally associated with religion".
Liebler and Moss write that "unlike some forms of meditation, the TM technique does not require adherence to any belief system".
Religious studies scholars Michael Phelan, James R. Lewis and Tamar Gablinger say that TM participants "may meditate for relaxation, but otherwise have no contact with TM", and that TM "attracts a large number of people with low levels of commitment around a much smaller group of highly committed followers."
Phelan writes that TM is "being opposed by many religious groups who believe that it is a religious practice", and that "the TM objectives and methods are congruous with the criteria of revitalization movements [as] defined by Anthony F.C. Wallace ... whose goal is to create a better culture."
Charles H. Lippy writes that earlier spiritual interest in the technique faded in the 1970s, and "it became a practical technique ... that anyone could employ without abandoning their religious identification."
On the other hand, Bainbridge finds TM to be a "... highly simplified form of Hinduism, adapted for Westerners who did not possess the cultural background to accept the full panoply of Hindu beliefs, symbols, and practices", and describes the TM puja ceremony as "... in essence, a religious initiation ceremony".
Metropolitan Maximos of Pittsburgh of the Greek Orthodox Church describes TM as "a new version of Hindu Yoga" based on "pagan pseudo-worship and deification of a common mortal, Guru Dev".
In the book "Cults and new religions", Cowan and Bromley write that TM is presented to the public as a meditation practice that has been validated by science, but is not a religious practice nor is it affiliated with a religious tradition.
They say that "although there are some dedicated followers of TM who devote most or all of their time to furthering the practice of Transcendental Meditation in late modern society, the vast majority of those who practice do so on their own, often as part of what has been loosely described as the New Age Movement."
They say that most scholars view TM as having elements of both therapy and religion, but that it "has no designated scripture, no set of doctrinal requirements, no ongoing worship activity, and no discernible community of believers."
They also say that Maharishi did not claim to have special divine revelation or supernatural personal qualities.
George D. Chryssides and Margaret Z. Wilkins write in "A reader in new religious movements" that TM and other new religious movements have been criticised for "surreptitiously smuggling in forms of Eastern religion under the guise of some seemingly innocuous technique of self improvement or health promotion".
Chryssides went on to say in "Exploring new religions" that although one can identify the yogi's Hindu background, Hindu lineage, mantras and initiation ceremony, TM is unlike religion in its "key elements": "there is no public worship, no code of ethics, no scriptures to be studied, and no rites of passage that are observed, such as dietary laws, giving to the poor, or pilgrimages."
Psychiatry professor Norman E. Rosenthal, author of "", wrote that "Maharishi extracted the TM technique from its religious context and distilled it to its essence, which he believed could be of value to people of all creeds."
Government.
In 1968, the Maharishi conducted a one-hour meeting with Secretary General of the United Nations U Thant.
In the 1970s, courses in the TM technique were conducted at 47 military installations around the world (including eight in the U.S.), with 150 enrolling in the course at the West Point military academy.
The TM technique was also taught at five U.S. federal prisons, and three in Germany and Canada.
During this period, ten U.S. senators and more than 100 Congressional staff members learned the technique.
In 1972, the Maharishi met with the Governor of Illinois (Daniel Walker) and received a standing ovation when he addressed the Illinois state legislature before they passed a resolution characterising Maharishi's Science of Creative Intelligence as useful for Illinois public schools.
In 1974, TM was cited in two Congressional records regarding the SCI course being offered at 30 American universities and the technique being "in use" in some American prisons, mental institutions and drug rehabilitation centers.
In 1975, the Maharishi met with Pierre Trudeau to discuss "the possibility of structuring an ideal society" through TM.
In 1977 a U.S. district court in New Jersey held that a curriculum comprising the Science of Creative Intelligence and TM was religious in nature ("Malnak v Yogi").
The decision was appealed and in 1979 the 3rd Circuit opinion affirmed the decision and held that although SCI/TM is not a theistic religion, it deals with issues of ultimate concern, truth, and other ideas analogous to those of well-recognized religions and it therefore violated the Establishment Clause.
Beginning in 1979 the German government released a number of booklets about problems arising for seven new religious movements in Germany, with the German term for these organisations variously translated as "psychogroups" and "psychotheraphy groups".
These organisations, including TM, filed lawsuits trying to block the reports.
The courts ruled that the booklets must only include factual information and exclude speculation, rumours, and matters that are unclear, and the booklets were re-released primarily containing quotations from materials of the organisations themselves.
In 1996 a commission appointed by the German government concluded that new religious movements and "psychotherapy groups" did not present any danger to the state or to society.
In 1987, an Israeli government report defined TM as a "cult group ... targeted by anti-cult activists".
The 1995 report of the Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France included Transcendental Meditation in its list of cults.
The U.S. government has characterised the Transcendental Meditation technique as worthy of research and has awarded more than $25 million in funding from different branches of the National Institutes of Health for scientific analysis of the effects of TM on high blood pressure.
The United States Department of Veterans Affairs sees it as a potential tool for the treatment of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and commenced research on the technique (and two other meditation systems) in 2012.
According to Patrick Gresham Williams, "the government will pay" for any U.S. veteran to learn TM if it is prescribed by a Veterans Administration medical doctor.
Tai chi 
Tai chi (), short for Tai chi ch'üan (), sometimes called "shadowboxing", is an internal Chinese martial art practiced for defense training, health benefits and meditation.
Tai chi has practitioners worldwide from Asia to the Americas.
Practitioners such as Yang Chengfu and Sun Lutang in the early 20th Century promoted the art for its health benefits.
Its global following may be attributed to overall benefit to personal health.
Many forms are practiced, both traditional and modern.
Most modern styles trace their development to the five traditional schools: Chen, Yang, Wu (Hao), Wu, and Sun.
All trace their historical origins to Chen Village, China.
Conceptual background.
The philosophical and conceptual background to Tai chi relies on Chinese philosophy, particularly Daoist and Confucian thought as well as on the Chinese classics.
Early Tai Chi texts include embedded quotations from classic Chinese works like the "Yijing", "Great Learning", "Book of History", "Records of the Grand Historian", Zhu Xi, Zhou Dunyi, Mencius and Zhuangzi.
Early Tai Chi sources also ground Tai Chi in the cosmology of "Tai Chi" ((太极, "tàijí", "Supreme Polarity", or "Greatest Ultimate") from which the art gets its name.
Tai Chi cosmology appears in both Taoist and Confucian philosophy, where it represents the single source or mother of yin and yang (represented by the "taijitu" symbol ).
Tai Chi also draws on Chinese theories of the body, particularly Daoist neidan (internal alchemy) teachings on Qi (vital energy) and on the three dantiens.
Zheng Manqing emphasizes the Daoist background of Tai Chi and states that "Taijiquan enables us to reach the stage of undifferentiated pure yang, which is exactly the same as Laozi's 'concentrating the qi and developing softness'".
As such, Tai Chi considers itself an "internal" martial art which focuses on developing the qi.
In China, Tai Chi is categorized under the "Wudang" grouping of Chinese martial arts—that is, arts applied with internal power.
Although the term 'Wudang' suggests these arts originated in the Wudang Mountains, it is used only to distinguish the skills, theories and applications of "neijia" (internal arts) from those of the Shaolin grouping, or "waijia" (hard or external) styles.
Tai Chi also adopts the Daoist ideals of softness overcoming hardness, of wu-wei (effortless action), and of yielding into its martial art technique, while also retaining Daoist ideas of spiritual self-cultivation.
Tai Chi's path is one of developing naturalness by relaxing, attending inward, and slowing mind, body and breath.
This allows us to become less tense, to drop our conditioned habits, let go of thoughts, allow qi to flow smoothly, and thus to flow with the Dao.
It is thus a kind of moving meditation that allows us to let go of the self (wuwo), and experience no-mind (wuxin) and spontaneity (ziran).
A key aspect of Tai Chi philosophy is to work with the flow of yin (softness) and yang (hardness) elements.
When two forces push each other with equal force, neither side moves.
Motion cannot occur until one side yields.
Therefore, a key principle in Tai Chi is to avoid using force directly against force (hardness against hardness).
Lao Tzŭ provided the archetype for this in the "Tao Te Ching" when he wrote, "The soft and the pliable will defeat the hard and strong."
Conversely, when in possession of leverage, one may want to use hardness to force the opponent to become soft.
Traditionally, Tai Chi uses both soft and hard.
Yin is said to be the mother of Yang, using soft power to create hard power.
Traditional schools also emphasize that one is expected to show "wude" ("martial virtue/heroism"), to protect the defenseless, and show mercy to one's opponents.
Practice.
Traditionally, the foundational Tai Chi practice consists of learning and practicing a specific solo forms or routines ("taolu)".
This entails learning a routine sequence of movements that emphasize a straight spine, abdominal breathing and a natural range of motion.
Tai chi relies on knowing the appropriate change in response to outside forces, as well as on yielding to and redirecting an attack, rather than meeting it with opposing force.
Physical fitness is also seen as an important step towards effective self-defense.
There are also numerous other supporting solo practices such as: 
Further training entails learning "tuishou" (push hands drills)", sanshou" (striking techniques), free sparring, grappling training, and weapons training.
In the "T'ai-chi classics", writings by tai chi masters, it is noted that the physiological and kinesiological aspects of the body's movements are characterized by the circular motion and rotation of the pelvis, based on the metaphors of the pelvis as the hub and the arms and feet as the spokes of a wheel.
Furthermore, the respiration of breath is coordinated with the physical movements in a state of deep relaxation, rather than muscular tension, in order to guide the practitioners to a state of homeostasis.
Tai Chi Quan is a complete martial art system with a full range of bare-hand movement sets and weapon forms, such as Tai Chi sword and Tai Chi spear, which are based on the dynamic relationship between "Yin" and "Yang".
While Tai Chi is typified by its slow movements, many styles (including the three most popular: Yang, Wu, and Chen) have secondary, faster-paced forms.
Some traditional schools teach martial applications of the postures of different forms (taolu).
Solo practices.
"Taolu" (solo "forms") is a choreography that serves as the encyclopedia of a martial art.
Tai chi is often characterized by slow movements in Taolu practice, and one of the reasons is to develop body awareness.
Accurate, repeated practice of the solo routine is said to retrain posture, encourage circulation throughout students' bodies, maintain flexibility, and familiarize students with the martial sequences implied by the forms.
The traditional styles of tai chi have forms that differ in aesthetics, but share many similarities that reflect their common origin.
Solo forms (empty-hand and weapon) are catalogues of movements that are practised individually in pushing hands and martial application scenarios to prepare students for self-defense training.
In most traditional schools, variations of the solo forms can be practised: fast / slow, small-circle / large-circle, square / round (different expressions of leverage through the joints), low-sitting/high-sitting (the degree to which weight-bearing knees stay bent throughout the form).
Breathing exercises; "neigong" (internal skill) or, more commonly, "qigong" (life energy cultivation) are practiced to develop "qi" (life energy) in coordination with physical movement and "zhan zhuang" (standing like a post) or combinations of the two.
These were formerly taught as a separate, complementary training system.
In the last 60 years they have become better known to the general public.
"Qigong" involves coordinated movement, breath, and awareness used for health, meditation, and martial arts.
While many scholars and practitioners consider tai chi to be a type of "qigong", the two are commonly seen as separate but closely related practices.
"Qigong" plays an important role in training for tai chi.
Many tai chi movements are part of qigong practice.
The focus of qigong is typically more on health or meditation than martial applications.
Internally the main difference is the flow of "qi".
In qigong, the flow of "qi" is held at a gate point for a moment to aid the opening and cleansing of the channels.
In tai chi, the flow of "qi" is continuous, thus allowing the development of power by the practitioner.
Partnered practice.
Tai chi's martial aspect relies on sensitivity to the opponent's movements and center of gravity, which dictate appropriate responses.
Disrupting the opponent's center of gravity upon contact is the primary goal of the martial t'ai-chi ch'üan student.
The sensitivity needed to capture the center is acquired over thousands of hours of first "yin" (slow, repetitive, meditative, low-impact) and then later adding "yang" (realistic, active, fast, high-impact) martial training through "taolu" (forms), "tuishou" (pushing hands), and "sanshou" (sparring).
Tai chi trains in three basic ranges: close, medium and long.
Pushes and open-hand strikes are more common than punches, and kicks are usually to the legs and lower torso, never higher than the hip, depending on style.
The fingers, fists, palms, sides of the hands, wrists, forearms, elbows, shoulders, back, hips, knees, and feet are commonly used to strike.
Targets are the eyes, throat, heart, groin, and other acupressure points.
"Chin na", which are joint traps, locks, and breaks are also used.
Most tai chi teachers expect their students to thoroughly learn defensive or neutralizing skills first, and a student must demonstrate proficiency with them before learning offensive skills.
Martial schools focus on how the energy of a strike affects the opponent.
A palm strike that looks to have the same movement may be performed in such a way that it has a completely different effect on the opponent's body.
A palm strike could simply push the opponent backward, or instead be focused in such a way as to lift the opponent vertically off the ground, changing center of gravity; or it could project the force of the strike into the opponent's body with the intent of causing internal damage.
Most development aspects are meant to be covered within the partnered practice of "tuishou", and so, "sanshou" (sparring) is not commonly used as a method of training, although more advanced students sometimes practice by "sanshou".
"Sanshou" is more common to tournaments such as "wushu" tournaments.
Weapon practice.
Tai chi practices involving weapons also exist.
Weapons training and fencing applications often employ: 
More exotic weapons include: 
Attire and ranking.
Some martial arts require students to wear a uniform during practice.
In general, Tai Chi does not specify a uniform, although teachers often advocate loose, comfortable clothing and flat-soled shoes.
Modern day practitioners usually wear comfortable, loose T-shirts and trousers made from breathable natural fabrics, that allow for free movement.
Despite this, T'ai-chi ch'üan has become synonymous with "t'ai-chi uniforms" or "kung fu uniforms" that usually consist of loose-fitting traditional Chinese styled trousers and a long or short-sleeved shirt, with a Mandarin collar and buttoned with Chinese frog buttons.
The long-sleeved variants are referred to as Northern-style uniforms, whilst the short-sleeved, are Southern-style uniforms.
The clothing may be all white, all black, black and white, or any other colour, mostly a single solid colour or a combination of two colours: one colour for the garment and another for the binding.
They are normally made from natural fabrics such as cotton or silk.
They are usually worn by masters and professional practitioners during demonstrations, tournaments and other public exhibitions.
Tai chi has no standardized ranking system, except the Chinese Wushu Duan wei exam system run by the Chinese wushu association in Beijing.
Most schools do not use belt rankings.
Some schools present students with belts depicting rank, similar to "dans" in Japanese martial arts.
A simple uniform element of respect and allegiance to one's teacher and their methods and community, belts also mark hierarchy, skill, and accomplishment.
During "wushu" tournaments, masters and grandmasters often wear "kung fu uniforms" which tend to have no belts.
Wearing a belt signifying rank in such a situation would be unusual.
Seated tai chi.
Traditional tai chi was developed for self-defense, but it has evolved to include a graceful form of seated exercise now used for stress reduction and other health conditions.
Often described as meditation in motion, seated tai chi promotes serenity through gentle, flowing movements.
Seated tai chi exercises is touted by the medical community and researchers.
It is based primarily on the Yang short form, and has been adopted by the general public, medical practitioners, tai chi instructors, and the elderly.
Seated forms are not a simple redesign of the yang short form.
Instead, the practice attempts to preserve the integrity of the form, with its inherent logic and purpose.
The synchronization of the upper body with the steps and the breathing developed over hundreds of years, and guided the transition to seated positions.
Marked improvements in balance, blood pressure levels, flexibility and muscle strength, peak oxygen intake, and body fat percentages can be achieved.
Etymology.
Tai Chi was known as "大恒" by the Ancient Chinese.
The silk version of I Ching recorded this original name.
Due to the name taboo of Emperor Wen of Western Han Empire , "大恒" changed to "太極.".
Sundial shadow length changes represent traditional Chinese Medicine with four elements theory instead of Confucian politician-based five elements theory.
In the beginning, the color white was associated with Yin, while black was associated with Yang.
Confucianism uses the reverse.
The term "taiji" is a Chinese cosmological concept for the flux of yin and yang.
'Quan' means technique.
"Tàijíquán" and "T'ai-chi ch'üan" are two different transcriptions of three Chinese characters that are the written Chinese name for the art form: 
The English language offers two spellings, one derived from Wade–Giles and the other from the Pinyin transcription.
Most Westerners often shorten this name to "t'ai chi" (often omitting the aspirate sign—thus becoming "tai chi").
This shortened name is the same as that of the "t'ai-chi" philosophy.
However, the Pinyin romanization is "taiji".
The "chi" in the name of the martial art is not the same as "ch'i" ("qi" the "life force").
"Ch'i" is involved in the practice of "t'ai-chi ch'üan."
Although the word is traditionally written "chi" in English, the closest pronunciation, using English sounds, to that of Standard Chinese would be "jee", with "j" pronounced as in "jump" and "ee" pronounced as in "bee".
Other words exist with pronunciations in which the "ch" is pronounced as in "champ".
Thus, it is important to use the "j" sound.
This potential for confusion suggests preferring the pinyin spelling, "taiji".
Most Chinese use the Pinyin version.
History.
Early development.
Taijiquan's formative influences came from practices undertaken in Taoist and Buddhist monasteries, such as Wudang, Shaolin and The Thousand Year Temple in Henan.
The early development of Tai Chi proper is connected with Henan's Thousand Year Temple and a nexus of nearby villages: Chen Village, Tang Village, Wangbao Village, and Zhaobao Town.
These villages were closely connected, shared an interest in the martial arts and many went to study at Thousand Year Temple (which was a syncretic temple with elements from the three teachings).
New documents from these villages, mostly dating to the 17th century, are some of the earliest sources for the practice of Taijiquan.
Some traditionalists claim that Tai chi is a purely Chinese art that comes from ancient Daoism and Confucianism.
These schools believe that Tai chi theory and practice were formulated by Taoist monk Zhang Sanfeng in the 12th century.
These stories are often filled with legendary and hagiographical content and lack historical support.
Modern historians pointing out that the earliest reference indicating a connection between Zhang Sanfeng and martial arts is actually a 17th-century piece called "Epitaph for Wang Zhengnan" (1669), composed by Huang Zongxi (1610–1695).
Aside from this single source, the other claims of connections between Tai chi and Zhang Sanfeng appeared no earlier than the 19th century.
According to Douglas Wile, "there is no record of a Zhang Sanfeng in the Song Dynasty (960-1279), and there is no mention in the Ming (1368-1644) histories or hagiographies of Zhang Sanfeng of any connection between the immortal and the material arts."
Another common theory for the origin of Tai Chi is that it was created by Chen Wangting (1580–1660) while living in Chen Village (陳家溝), Henan province.
The other four contemporary traditional Taijiquan styles (Yang, Sun, Wu and Wu (Hao)) trace their teachings back to Chen village in the early 1800s.
Yang Luchan (1799–1872), the founder of the popular Yang style, trained with the Chen family for 18 years before he started to teach in Beijing, which strongly suggests that his work was heavily influenced by the Chen family art.
Martial arts historian Xu Zhen claimed that the Tai chi of Chen Village was influenced by the "Taizu changquan" style practiced at nearby Shaolin Monastery, while Tang Hao thought it was derived from a treatise by Ming dynasty general Qi Jiguang, "Jixiao Xinshu" ("New Treatise on Military Efficiency"), which discussed several martial arts styles including "Taizu changquan".
Tai Chi appears to have received the name "Tai Chi" during the mid-19th century.
Imperial Court scholar Ong Tong witnessed a demonstration by Yang Luchan before Yang had established his reputation as a teacher.
Afterwards Ong wrote: "Hands holding Tai chi shakes the whole world, a chest containing ultimate skill defeats a gathering of heroes."
Before this time the art may have had other names, and appears to have been generically described by outsiders as "zhan quan" (, "touch boxing"), "Mian Quan" ("soft boxing") or "shisan shi" (, "the thirteen techniques").
Standardization.
In 1956 the Chinese government sponsored the Chinese Sports Committee (CSC), which brought together four "wushu" teachers to truncate the Yang family hand form to 24 postures.
This was an attempt to standardize T'ai-chi ch'üan for "wushu" tournaments as they wanted to create a routine that would be much less difficult to learn than the classical 88 to 108 posture solo hand forms.
Another 1950s form is the "97 movements combined t'ai-chi ch'üan form", which blends Yang, Wu, Sun, Chen, and Fu styles.
In 1976, they developed a slightly longer demonstration form that would not require the traditional forms' memory, balance, and coordination.
This became the "Combined 48 Forms" that were created by three "wushu" coaches, headed by Men Hui Feng.
The combined forms simplified and combined classical forms from the original Chen, Yang, Wu, and Sun styles.
Other competitive forms were designed to be completed within a six-minute time limit.
In the late 1980s, CSC standardized more competition forms for the four major styles as well as combined forms.
These five sets of forms were created by different teams, and later approved by a committee of "wushu" coaches in China.
These forms were named after their style: the "Chen-style national competition form" is the "56 Forms".
The combined forms are "The 42-Form" or simply the "Competition Form".
In the 11th Asian Games of 1990, "wushu" was included as an item for competition for the first time with the "42-Form" representing t'ai-chi ch'üan.
The International Wushu Federation (IWUF) applied for "wushu" to be part of the Olympic games.
Taijiquan was added to the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists in 2020 for China.
Styles.
Chinese origin.
The five major styles of tai chi are named for the Chinese families who originated them: 
The most popular is Yang, followed by Wu, Chen, Sun and Wu/Hao.
The styles share underlying theory, but their training differs.
Dozens of new styles, hybrid styles, and offshoots followed, although the family schools are accepted as standard by the international community.
Other important styles are Zhaobao tàijíquán, a close cousin of Chen style, which is recognized by Western practitioners; Fu style, created by Fu Chen Sung, which evolved from Chen, Sun and Yang styles, and incorporates movements from Baguazhang (Pa Kua Chang); and Cheng Man-ch'ing style which simplifies Yang style.
Most existing styles came from Chen style, which had been passed down as a family secret for generations.
The designation "internal" or "neijia" martial arts is also used to broadly distinguish what are known as "external" or "waijia" styles based on "Shaolinquan" styles, although that distinction may be disputed by modern schools.
In this broad sense, "all" styles of t'ai chi, as well as related arts such as Baguazhang and Xingyiquan, are, therefore, considered to be "soft" or "internal" martial arts.
United States.
Choy Hok Pang, a disciple of Yang Chengfu, was the first known proponent of tai chi to openly teach in the United States, beginning in 1939.
His son and student Choy Kam Man emigrated to San Francisco from Hong Kong in 1949 to teach t'ai-chi ch'üan in Chinatown.
Choy Kam Man taught until he died in 1994.
Sophia Delza, a professional dancer and student of Ma Yueliang, performed the first known public demonstration of tai chi in the United States at the New York City Museum of Modern Art in 1954.
She wrote the first English language book on t'ai-chi, "T'ai-chi ch'üan: Body and Mind in Harmony", in 1961.
She taught regular classes at Carnegie Hall, the Actors Studio, and the United Nations.
Zheng Manqing/Cheng Man-ch'ing, who opened his school Shr Jung t'ai-chi after he moved to New York from Taiwan in 1964.
Unlike the older generation of practitioners, Zheng was cultured and educated in American ways, and thus was able to transcribe Yang's dictation into a written manuscript that became the de facto manual for Yang style.
Zheng felt Yang's traditional 108-movement form was unnecessarily long and repetitive, which makes it difficult to learn.
He thus created a shortened 37-movement version that he taught in his schools.
Zheng's form became the dominant form in the eastern United States until other teachers immigrated in larger numbers in the 1990s.
He taught until his death in 1975.
United Kingdom.
Norwegian Pytt Geddes was the first European to teach tai chi in Britain, holding classes at The Place in London in the early 1960s.
She had first encountered tai chi in Shanghai in 1948, and studied with Choy Hok Pang and his son Choy Kam Man (who both also taught in the United States) while living in Hong Kong in the late 1950s.
Lineage.
Modern forms.
The Cheng Man-ch'ing (Zheng Manqing) and Chinese Sports Commission short forms are derived from Yang family forms, but neither is recognized as Yang family tai chi by standard-bearing Yang family teachers.
The Chen, Yang, and Wu families promote their own shortened demonstration forms for competitive purposes.
Purposes.
The primary purposes of tai chi are health, sport/self-defense and aesthetics.
Practitioners mostly interested in tai chi's health benefits diverged from those who emphasize self-defense, and also those who attracted by its aesthetic appeal ("wushu").
More traditional practitioners hold that the two aspects of health and martial arts make up the art's "yin" and "yang".
The "family" schools present their teachings in a martial art context, whatever the intention of their students.
Health.
Tai chi's health training concentrates on relieving stress on the body and mind.
In the 21st century, Tai chi classes that purely emphasize health are popular in hospitals, clinics, community centers and senior centers.
Tai chi's low-stress training method for seniors has become better known.
Clinical studies exploring Tai chi's effect on specific diseases and health conditions exist, though there are not sufficient studies with consistent approaches to generate a comprehensive conclusion.
Tai chi has been promoted for treating various ailments, and is supported by the Parkinson's Foundation and Diabetes Australia, among others.
However, medical evidence of effectiveness is lacking and research has been undertaken to address this.
A 2017 systematic review found that it decreased falls in older people.
Sport and self-defense.
As a martial art, tai chi emphasizes defense over attack and replies to hard with soft.
The ability to use tai chi as a form of combat is the test of a student's understanding of the art.
This is typically demonstrated via competition with others.
Practitioners test their skills against students from other schools and martial arts styles in "tuishou" ("pushing hands") and "sanshou" competition.
Wushu.
"Wushu" is primarily for show.
Forms taught for wushu are designed to earn points in competition and are mostly unconcerned with either health or self-defense.
Benefits.
A 2011 comprehensive overview of systematic reviews of tai chi recommended tai chi to older people for its physical and psychological benefits.
No conclusive evidence showed benefit for any of the conditions researched, including Parkinson's disease, diabetes, cancer and arthritis.
A 2015 systematic review found that tai chi could be performed by those with chronic medical conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, and osteoarthritis without negative effects, and found favorable effects on functional exercise capacity .
In 2015 the Australian Government's Department of Health published the results of a review of alternative therapies that sought to identify any that were suitable for coverage by health insurance.
T'ai-chi was one of 17 therapies evaluated.
The study concluded that low-quality evidence suggests that tai chi may have some beneficial health effects when compared to control in a limited number of populations for a limited number of outcomes.
In 2022, the U.S.A agency the National Institutes of Health published an analysis of various health claims, studies and findings.
They concluded the evidence was of low quality, but that it appears to have a small positive effect on quality of life.
Ekagrata 
Ekāgratā (, "one-pointedness"; Pali: ekaggatā) is intent pursuit of one object, close and undisturbed attention.
Yoga emphasises regular practice ("Abhyasa") of meditation and self-imposed discipline to acquire .
Overview.
The faculty called may be increased by integrating the psycho-mental flux ( or variously-directed, discontinuous, and diffuse attention) so that one gains genuine will and a happiness different from the experience of pleasure from sense-objects.
It is harder to achieve if the body is in a tiring or uncomfortable posture or if the breathing is improper.
Austerity ("tapas") is allied to this conception of .
Badarayana's Brahma Sutras (chapter 3) uses the term to mean concentration: it is held to be a quality resulting from practices discussed in the previous chapter, which are briefly mentioned in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad and Chandogya Upanishad.
According to the Bhagavad Gita the seeker after Truth should meditate with his mind fixed on the Lord () and absorbed in Him ().
This is "ekagrata".
The term "nityayuktāh" refers to devotees who keep their mind fixed on God uninterruptedly.
Patanjali highlights the importance of continuous practice of prescribed methods to gain ekagrata, the state of the meditative mind free of diverted attention etc.; and thereafter explains that: 
Attention on a single point () of the mind ("citta") gives rise to equilibrium of placid states (previously accumulated impressions) and aroused states (present eagerness to gain more knowledge), which are modifications (of the mind).
These two states of mind remain unchanged and are brought to the state of stillness. and "dhāraṇā" do not differ from each other, or else is achieving and maintaining . converges on a particular concept or object.
In the state of there is clarity and right direction: yoga begins with ekagrata and culminates in "nirodha", a stillness of consciousness. gives the ability to see one’s own mind, one starts looking inwards deeply.
If is lost the full power of intention to achieve goals to be achieved is lost.
Intentions afflicted by doubts, fears and reactive thoughts break and diffuse the energy of intentions.
The mind which is the cause of "Sankalpa" ('notion')-"Vikalpa" ('alternative') must be controlled, it must be bound. assists in keeping one’s own mind bound and still.
Amritabindu Upanishad 
The Amritabindu Upanishad (Sanskrit:अमृतबिन्दु उपनिषद्) is one of the minor Upanishads of Hinduism.
It is one of the five "Bindu Upanishads", attached to the Atharvaveda, and one of twenty Yoga Upanishads in the four Vedas.
The text is notable for condemning "bookish learning" and emphasizing practice, as well as for presenting a six limbed Yoga system which match five stages of the eight stage Patanjali's Yogasutras and offering a unique, different sixth stage.
The Amṛitabindu is listed at number 20 in the serial order of the Muktika enumerated by Rama to Hanuman in the modern era anthology of 108 Upanishads.
The text sometimes appears under the title "Brahmabindu Upanishad" or "Amritanada Upanishad", in some anthologies.
It shares over 20 Vedanta-philosophy related verses with Amritanada Upanishad in compilations where these two texts are separated into independent Upanishads.
Nomenclature.
Paul Deussen states that the title has two meanings, first being "the esoteric doctrine of a bindu (point) or nada (reverberation) of the word Om which signifies Brahman", while the second meaning is a drop which grants immortality.
The discussion of Om by the text, states Deussen, suggests that the former meaning may be more appropriate.
It is one of five Upanishads whose title has the suffix "bindu" meaning "drop", while “amrita” represents nectar of immortality like ambrosia in Greek literature parlance, but here its real emphasis is on mind.
Amritabindu Upanishad, also meaning "Immortal Point," differentiates between vocal recitation of the Om syllable and its non-vocal practice.
The different names of similar texts may be the result of a scribal error that persisted as the text spread across India.
However, the number of verses vary between the manuscripts, ranging from twenty two verses in Ayyangar translation, and 38 in Deussen translation.
The text, states Deussen, has also been referred to as "Amritanada Upanishad" by medieval Indian scholars such as Sayana of the Vijayanagara Empire.
David Gordon White states that Bindu and Nada Upanishads were related, deriving their nomenclature from the symbol Om and its relation to meditation on the Brahman metaphysical reality, the Nada texts "all show some similarities to the bindu texts", and may have origins in the Tantric traditions.
The text of Amritabindu Upanishad, states White, appears under the title of Brahmabindu Upanishad in some older anthology.
Chronology and anthology.
Mircea Eliade suggests that Amritabindu Upanishad was possibly composed in the same period as the didactic parts of the Mahabharata, the chief Sannyasa Upanishads and along with other early Yoga Upanishads: Brahmabindu (probably composed about the same time as Maitri Upanishad), Ksurika, Tejobindu, Brahmavidya, Nadabindu, Yogashikha, Dhyanabindu and Yogatattva Upanishad.
Eliade's suggestion places these in the final centuries of BCE or early centuries of the CE.
All these, adds Eliade, were likely composed earlier than the ten or eleven later Yoga Upanishads such as the Yoga-kundali, Varaha and Pashupatabrahma Upanishads.
Paul Deussen states that this text may have preceded Patanjali's Yogasutras text, because it lists six instead of eight limbs for yoga, and both Maitri Upanishad in section 6.18 and Amritabindu place "Dharana" after "Dhyana", a sequence that is reverse of what is found in the Yogasutras and all later Yoga texts of Hinduism.
Both Maitri and Amritabindu, adds Deussen, include the concept of "Tarka" in their verses, which may be important to their relative dating.
Gavin Flood dates the Amritabindu text, along with other Yoga Upanishads, to be probably from the 100 BCE to 300 CE period.
This Upanishad is among those which have been differently attached to two Vedas, depending on the region where the manuscript was found.
Deussen states it and all Bindu Upanishads are attached to the Atharvaveda, while Ayyangar states it attached to the Krishna Yajurveda.
In Colebrooke's version of 52 Upanishads popular in north India, the text is listed at number 19 along with the other four Bindu Upanishads with similar theme.
The Narayana anthology also includes this Upanishad at number 11 in "Bibliothica Indica".
In the collection of Upanishads under the title "Oupanekhat", put together by Sultan Mohammed Dara Shikhoh in 1656, consisting of a Persian translation of 50 Upanishads and who prefaced it as the best book on religion, it is listed at number 26 and is named "Ambart bandeh"(also known as Amrtabindu or Brahmabindu).
Structure.
The text opens with an introduction consisting of four verses, followed by four sections of which three discuss the practice, rules and rewards of yoga, followed by a discourse on life-force ("Prana", breath).
The text ends with a one verse summary.
Like almost all other Yoga Upanishads, the text is composed in verse form.
The Amritabindu Upanishad is part of a group of five Bindu Upanishads, all dedicated to Yoga.
All five of Bindu Upanishads emphasize the practice of Yoga and Dhyana (meditation) with Om, to apprehend Atman (soul, self).
Contents.
Introduction.
The text opens stating that it is the wise, who after reading the text books repeatedly, throw away the books and proceed to the practice of yoga with meditation on the silent, invisible Om, in their pursuit of the Brahman-knowledge (ultimate unchanging reality).
This lack of interest and esteem in learning or study of the Vedas is found in other Bindu Upanishads, states Deussen, and may reflect ancient trend among Yogins.
In the initial verses the Upanishad differentiates the mind under pure and impure states, and assigns its character as "bondage and liberation".
Further enquiry into the crux of the matter reveals that Truth is realized within Vasudev, which is one's Self.
The practice of yoga.
The Amritabindu Upanishad states that there are six limbs of yoga, whose sequence and one limb is different from Patanjali's Yogasutras: 
The verse 10 of the Upanishad recommends internally reciting Gayatri, Vyahrtis and Pranava (Om) mantras as counters to time the length of the breathing exercises, while the section reminds the yogi to drink water and breath deeply to cleanse the body and senses.
The rules of yoga.
The verse 17 of the text begins the rules and recommendation for yoga practice.
It begins by stating that one must pick a proper place for yoga, which translates Deussen, is "a level surface of ground, pleasant and free from faults".
Place a mat, settle in, and enter an Asana, states the Upanishad, such as Padmasana, Svastikasana or even Bhadrasana.
The yogi should face north, perform breathing exercises, alternating with the two nostrils, then in the state of comfort and being pacific, say Om and begin meditating.
Close and cast your eyes within, asserts the text in verse 22, sit motionless, practice yoga.
Reach rhythmic breathing, concentrate, chain in the mind, reflect and reason, and proceed towards the union in the soul.
It is unclear, states Deussen, whether the text implies union of individual soul with highest soul (Anquetil's interpretation), or Prana and Apana (Narayana's interpretation), or is a choice left to the yogi.
The yogi should be silent, still, lost from the outer world, reflecting or remembering the sacred syllable (Om) internally.
In verse 27, the Upanishad lists the Yamas (ethics of yogi with others) and Niyamas (ethics of yogi with one's own body).
The rewards of yoga.
Three months of dedicated yoga practice, asserts verse 28 of the text, begins to bring rewards to body.
In four months the yogi sees the Devas within, strength marks the yogi in five months, and after six months from starting yoga there is an "absoluteness of will" and sense of blissful aloneness, independence (Kaivalya) in the yogi states verse 29.
The verses 30–31 describe how meditation and concentration on different moras of the Om syllable, the yogi thinks through soul and in soul alone.
Theory of Prana.
In some versions of the manuscript found in India, this section is much larger or called as Amritabindu Upanishad while the yoga part is titled separately as Amritanada Upanishad.
Many medieval Indian scholars considered these as one.
Ayyangar has translated this as a separate Upanishad.
The two Upanishads when separate, states White, share over 20 similar verses.
This section, adds White, represent exclusively classical Vedanta philosophy methods and goals.
To quote Swami Madhavananda – "the "Amritabindu Upanishad" inculcates, first, the control of the mind in the shape of desire-less-ness for sense-objects, as the most effective way to the attainment of liberation and the realisation of the One who is Knowledge and Bliss Absolute.
Then, it discusses the real nature of the soul and the realisation of the highest truth which leads to unity.
Thus, the central theme of all the Upanishads – viz., "that the Jiva and Brahman are eternally one, and that all duality is a mere superimposition due to ignorance" is described in this text.
In the above verse, "Amritabindu Upanishad" states that the mind is the cause of bondage and liberation.
A mind that craves for something else is in bondage, one that doesn't is liberated.
Spirituality is geared to obtain inner purity, calmness of the mind, and ultimately, liberation.
In the state of liberation the mental components like virtue and vice become irrelevant.
This section of Amritabindu text presents the Vedanta theory of non-dualism (Advaita).
It states that "there is only one Self in all creatures, that one appears many just as the moon appears many when reflected in many droplets", and the toughest connection yet most liberating connection one can make is with one's own Self (soul), which is difficult because it is concealed by Maya.
When one successfully removes this veil, look within, one realizes the Self and its unity with the eternal, indestructible, unchanging truth that is one with the universe.
Conclusion.
The text concludes with a single verse, asserting that one who has realized this knowledge is never reborn again, no matter where he dies.
Kalani Oceanside Retreat 
Kalani Oceanside Retreat, also known as Kalani Honua or Kalani, is a non-profit retreat center located on the Big Island of Hawai'i.
It was established in 1975 and focuses on natural and holistic living, yoga and relaxation, and spiritual retreats.
Kalani has historically been staffed by a core group of administrators, managers, and coordinators, plus volunteers from around the world.
In 2019 Kalani relaunched with a new board of directors, and with largely local staff in lieu of volunteer staffing.
Overview.
Kalani Oceanside Retreat, founded by Richard Koob and Earnest Morgan in 1975, is a non-profit retreat center, occupying a 120-acre compound located in the Puna District of the Big Island of Hawai'i.
Kalani's mission is "to provide a fun, safe, and educational retreat village which encourages ALOHA love for life in each person's own deepest way through participation in abundant nature, culture, and wellness experiences".
In keeping with the focus on nature, culture, and wellness, Kalani hosts diverse residential workshops; sponsors community arts and special events programs; provides lodging and meals for guests; oversees volunteer, sabbatical, and visiting artist education programs; and houses a sustainable community of residents in an ecovillage.
History.
In 1975, professional dancers Richard Koob and Earnest Morgan purchased the original 19-acre property, which they called Kalani Honua, translated as "harmony of Heaven on Earth".
They based the center on their ideal of building a community to "celebrate art, nature, health, and spirit".
In the early years, Kalani was a small family operation.
A conscious effort was made to include Hawaiian natives in the growing community.
Workshops and classes focused on topics such as Hawaiian culture, yoga, dance, painting, music, and creative writing.
Workshop and course offerings increased as Kalani became known as a destination retreat center.
Extensive volunteer, sabbatical, and visiting artist education programs were developed, and Kalani grew to be the largest and oldest retreat center in Hawaii.
Over time, the Kalani campus was expanded to its current 120 acres, with purchase of the adjacent 94-acre Kalani Kai ("Heavenly Sea") parcel, and the 6-acre Kalani Mauka ("Heavenly Uplands") parcel, land specifically dedicated to building a sustainable agricultural community.
Programs.
Kalani operates as a non-profit, 501(c)(3) charity through Kalani Honua, Inc., with a focus on nature, culture, and wellness.
Workshops offered at Kalani residential retreats focus on art and human development, holistic health, and Hawaiian culture, and include yoga, dance, and bodywork.
Kalani sponsors the Puna Community Arts Program, which consists of daily scheduled public offerings (more than 50 per week, many at no cost to the public, or by donation), such as yoga, meditation, qigong, dance, and alternative healing.
The weekly Ecstatic Dance draws a large number of participants from the surrounding community.
Special events consist of lectures, performances, symposia, festivals, dances, and other activities open to the general public, including the Puna Music Festival, Puna Culinary Festival, Illuminato, and the Hawaiʻi Yoga Festival.
Kalani oversees a residential volunteer education program, with more than 100 volunteers on site at a time.
Volunteers are expected to contribute to the community through work in the kitchen, housekeeping, grounds, maintenance, or administrative office, and are encouraged to participate in daily life in the community, as well as workshops, classes, and Arts Program activities.
Sabbatical and Visiting Artist programs are offered to encourage self-development and artistic endeavor, as well as to enrich the community.
The Hawaiʻi Massage School at Kalani offers full-time and part-time bodywork training, as well as an apprenticeship program approved by the Hawaiʻi State Massage Board to satisfy course requirements and prepare for the state certification examination.
The mission of Kalani emphasizes values of community, cultural and lifestyle diversity, and sustainable living.
Community members include international visitors, locals, and people of Hawaiian descent, along with "vegetarian, vegan, gay, straight or other, young or old".
As of 2013, the annual economic impact of Kalani was estimated at nearly $10 million.
The majority of Kalani's expenditures stay in the state, and contribute to the local economy of the Puna District, the poorest district in Hawaiʻi.
All proceeds from guest stays go into Kalani’s community programming and services.
According to Kalani founder Richard Koob "[Kalani buys] as much produce as we can from local farmers, with many farmers growing specifically to supply Kalani’s needs".
Structure and management.
Kalani's facilities include simple guest lodging, a large community dining area (dining lanai), numerous buildings and rooms dedicated to workshops and classes, resident housing and camping areas, and a clothing optional pool and spa area.
Grounds include gardens, open space, recreational areas, permaculture plantings, and natural areas.
Kalani's Wellness Department offers land and aquatic bodywork, including traditional Hawaiian LomiLomi, Thai massage, and Watsu.
Kalani serves healthy buffet-style meals in a roofed patio known in Hawaii as a "lanai".
The dining lanai is considered to play a central role in the community, described as a gathering place where one "can experience the daily rhythms of assembly and departure reminiscent of ancient village life".
A guide to Kalani's cuisine describes the food as "a Pacific fusion of local, Thai, Indian, Italian, and many other cuisines".
For 38 years Richard Koob served as the Director of Kalani.
Lester John ("LJ") Bates III was appointed as Kalani’s Executive Director in November 2012, and after a period of transition Richard Koob officially retired in July 2013.
Richard continues as a Kalani Board Member and Director Emeritus, assisting with the realization of Kalani's second thirty-year plan.
Kalani appointed a new Executive Director, Joel Tan, in April 2016.
Kalani operates with a small paid staff and a large volunteer workforce.
Institutional structure comprises a sustainable living educational focus in all departments: Programs, Cultural Heritage, Culinary/Kitchen, Ho'okipa/Housekeeping, Maintenance, New Construction, Permaculture/Horticulture, Information Management, Student/Faculty Services, Wellness/Massage, and Administration.
Kalani houses an "ecovillage" of resident "stewards" who live onsite and contribute to the community in a variety of ways.
Resident housing is primarily in clusters of eco-cottages, with an emphasis on sustainable living.
Environment.
Kalani is located on the Red Road (Highway 137 or Kapoho-Kalapana Road), named because it used to be paved with red cinder from the Kapoho eruption of 1960.
The road winds along rugged cliffs overlooking the ocean, through tropical rainforest, recent lava flows, and tunnel-like canopies of kamani ("Calophyllum inophyllum"), milo ("Thespesia populnea"), and hala ("Pandanus tectorius") trees.
Nearby natural areas include Isaac Hale Beach Park, a protected section of coastline popular for swimming, surfing, and boating; MacKenzie State Recreation Area, a secluded park featuring groves of ironwood trees and lava tubes that open to the ocean; Aʻakepa, a hidden expanse of lava flats and tide pools with tidal channels and small lagoons; and Kehena Beach, a natural black sand beach.
The Kapoho Tide Pools (officially named the Wai Opae Tide Pools Marine Life Conservation District), a protected coral reef ecosystem, and Ahalanui Beach Park, a volcanically heated hot pond, were destroyed during the 2018 lower Puna eruption.
Heritage sites.
Three heritage sites at Kalani are registered with the Hawai’i State Department of Land 
and Natural Resources: 
Awards.
Kalani has received awards on TripAdvisor: 
Members of Kalani's community have received awards for various contributions and activities: 
2018 lava-eruption closure and 2019 relaunch.
In May 2018, due to the 2018 lower Puna eruption, Kalani closed its operations, stating "Kalani is currently closed.
We are not accepting registrations or volunteer applications at this time. ...
Recent earthquake activity on Kilauea’s south flank and lava eruptions in the Leilani Estates Subdivision are affecting air quality."
Follow-up announcements in June 2018 stated that all operations had been indefinitely suspended.
In early 2019, Kalani was offered for sale by its owners.
Richard Koob's statement on his website announced that: 
On July 19, 2019, the organization announced a "rebirth" of Kalani, with a new board of directors.
The announcement stated "Kalani intends to relaunch with a new vision, supported by community crowd funding, to begin generating revenue, making necessary improvements and, ultimately, supporting healing and restoration to lower Puna."
As of July 23, 2019, Kalani has re-launched, with a new board of directors, and local employment in lieu of volunteer staff, and is gradually restoring its operations.
Nama sankeerthanam 
Nama Japam or Nama Sankeertanam is the "japa" (repetition) or "Sankirtana" of "nama" (name) of the Almighty.
The devotee chooses "Ishta-deva" or "Ishta devata" (Sanskrit "", literally "cherished divinity" from "iṣṭa" "desired, liked, cherished" and "devatā" "godhead, divinity," or "deva" "deity") and picks up a name of the Ishta deva to repeatedly chant the name vocally or in the mind any time, anywhere.
Devotees can form a group and do sankeertanam or singing together of name of the Almighty.
The trinities of Namasankeerthanam "Bodhendra Saraswathi","Sridhara Venkatesa Ayyaval" and "Marudanallur"Sadguru Swamigal compiled the Bhajana Sampradaya.
Namasankeerthanam also gained momentum through stalwarts such as Pudukottai Gopalakrishna Bhagavathar and "Haridhos Giri" who popularized it with adherence to paddathi(tradition).
"Gita Govinda","Tarangini (music)","Abhang" and Namavalis("Tempo") are few common genres.
Devotional songs were sung by "Mirabai","Surdas","Samarth Ramdas","Sant Eknath","Chokhamela","Purandara Dasa" and several other saints.
It is believed that Namasankeerthanam helps overcome the effects of Kali and karmic impressions in "Kali Yuga".
It is an inclusive form of "Bhakti", agnostic to gender and caste differences.
Bhishma considered chanting of the "Vishnu sahasranama" the best and easiest of all dharmas, or the means to attain relief from all bondage.
Adi Sankaracharya, the Advaita enlightened master, in verse 27 of his hymn, Bhaja Govindam, said that the Gita and Vishnu sahasranama should be chanted and the form of the Lord of Lakshmi-Narayana should always be meditated on.
He also said that the Sahasranama bestowed all noble virtues on those who chanted it.
Dynamic meditation 
Dynamic meditation is a form of meditation in which physical actions are involved.
The term appears in the early 1970s when Osho's descriptions of his "Rajneesh Dhyan Yoga," developed at meditation camps in the Indian mountains, were translated into English.
His prototypical method is still named "Dynamic Meditation."
The term has come into more general use to describe any approach to meditation that includes movement: examples are Sama and Haḍra among the Sufi mystics, the Gurdjieff movements, in the Dynamic Body Awareness ( or ) created in France by artist and anthropologist Martino Nicoletti and other sacred dances, "Qigong" and the many exercises developed in Buddhism and Taoism, in India those found in Yoga and Tantra, and the Latihan of Subud.
History.
Many cultures have traditions of meditative movement.
Japan has Katsugen undō (regenerating movement exercise, 活元運動, かつげんうんどう), a Seitai exercise developed by Haruchika Noguchi in which one lets go of conscious control of the body and allows it to heal itself.
In China there is also Zifagong, Re-do and Zi Ran Qigong.
In Iran and Turkey there is Mevlevi Dervish or Sufi whirling which originally was spontaneous and impromptu.
The origin of Sama is credited to Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī (Persian: جلال‌الدین محمد رومی), Sufi master and founder of the Mevlevi Order.
The story is that Rumi was walking through the town marketplace one day when he heard the rhythmic hammering of the goldbeaters.
It is believed that Rumi heard the dhikr, "la ilaha ilallah" or in English, "no god but Allah" in the apprentices beating of the gold, and was so entranced in bliss he stretched out both of his arms and started spinning in a circle.
With that the practice of Sama and the dervishes of the Mevlevi order were born.
Practice.
Osho believed that cathartic methods were necessary, since it was difficult for modern people to just sit and enter meditation; "I never tell people to begin with just sitting.
With a mad dance, you begin to be aware of a silent point within you; with sitting silently, you begin to be aware of madness."
His "dialectical" methods alternate activity and passivity, adapting elements of "mantra" and "pranayama", "latihan", kirtan and psychotherapeutic catharsis.
Breathwork 
Breathwork is a term for various breathing practices in which the conscious control of breathing is said to influence a person's mental, emotional or physical state, with a therapeutic effect.
Breathwork may be helpful for relaxation and stress in a similar way to meditation.
Although there are claims that breathwork may provide other health benefits, no other health benefits have been proven.
During a breathwork session, individuals will typically lie down and be instructed to breathe using particular methods, depending on the sub-type of breathwork.
In addition to a practitioner, breathwork sessions will often have "sitters" present.
Sitters are individuals who provide emotional or physical support to those practicing breathwork.
Most breathwork sessions last around an hour.
Breathwork practitioners believe that an individual's particular pattern of passive breathing can lead to insights about their unconscious mind.
Some common side effects include "sleepiness; tingling in the hands, feet, or face; and a sense of altered consciousness that can be distressing to some."
Breathwork is generally considered safe if done with a skilled practitioner, but there are contraindications such as cardiovascular disease, glaucoma, high blood pressure, mental illness, severe asthma, or seizure disorders, among others.
Description and sub-types.
Breathwork is a method of breath control that attempts to give rise to altered states of consciousness, and to have an effect on physical and mental well-being.
Derived from various spiritual and pre-scientific traditions from around the world, it was pioneered in the West by Wilhelm Reich.
According to Jack Raso, "breathwork" is described by proponents as a multiform "healing modality" characterized by stylized breathing.
Its purported design is to effect physical, emotional, and spiritual change.
Such a process can allegedly "dissolve limiting programs" that are "stored" in the mind and body, and increases one's ability to handle more "energy".
Vipassana Meditation focuses on breathing in and around the nose to calm the mind (anapanasati).
There are several sub-types of breathwork: 
Padma Samten 
Padma Samten (formerly Alfredo Aveline) is a Brazilian Buddhist lama.
Alfredo Aveline has bachelor's and master's degrees in quantum physics from Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), where he was professor from 1969 to 1994.
During those years, he studied quantum physics, a theory in which he found a similarity with Buddhist thought.
In the early 1980s, his interest in Buddhism was intensified.
In 1986, he founded Bodhisattva Center for Buddhist Studies (CEBB).
In 1993, he was accepted by Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche as his disciple and in 1996 he was ordained lama, a title meaning leader, priest and teacher.
Since that time, Lama Samten has traveled and taught, helping to structure and sustain practice groups throughout Brazil.
Lama Samten received training from teachers of various Buddhist traditions including Zen, and traveled to Asia on several occasions.
He has contributed to bring masters, including Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche, B. Alan Wallace and the Dalai Lama, to Brazil.
In Viamão (RS), where he resides, is located the temple, the school and the community houses of the Bodhisattva Center for Buddhist Studies (CEBB).
Lama Samten has been a teacher, lecturer and consultant in companies, government agencies, hospitals, buddhist temples and universities.
Because of his work integrating Buddhism and mind training to the fields of psychology, medicine, economy and education, he has been awarded honorary citizenship in Curitiba (2008) and Viamão (2012).
Zou huo ru mo 
Zou huo ru mo () or is a Chinese-culture concept traditionally used to indicate that something has gone wrong in spiritual or martial arts training.
The qigong community uses this term to describe a physiological or psychological disorder believed to result during or after qigong practice, due to "improper practice" of qigong and other self-cultivation techniques.
The concept was highlighted in the social and political context of mass popularization of qigong in China.
The Buddhist or Taoist community also uses this term when referring to people who practice esoteric techniques or meditation without the proper guidance of a teacher.
Background.
The Chinese word "zǒuhuǒrùmó" ( "①be obsessed with sth. ②possessed by the Devil") combines "zǒuhuǒ(r)" ("①〈elec.〉 ⓐspark ⓑhave a short circuit ②〈coll.〉 discharge (a firearm) accidentally ③overstate ④catch fire; be on fire") and "rùmó" ("①be spellbound ②be infatuated/obsessed").
In recent times this syndrome has been known as The term has traditionally been applied to indicate that something has gone wrong in one's martial arts training, interpreted as "imbalance of qi (life energy)".
In more recent history, the term has been applied to refer to undesirable somatic or psychological effects experienced during or after the practice of the broad range of Chinese self-cultivation exercises known as qigong.
Most cases do not last for an extended period of time, and are never brought to medical attention.
While qigong could potentially act as a stressor in some vulnerable individuals, relations between qigong and disorders are manifold, and causal relationships have not been demonstrated.
Similar syndromes have been observed in other forms of self-cultivation practices such as yoga (Kundalini syndrome), meditation, and hypnosis.
Symptoms.
Symptoms are often identified as being in one of three categories:  
Somatic symptoms can include sensations and pain in head, chest and back, abdomen, limbs, or whole body; whereas, mental and emotional symptoms can include neurasthenia, affective disorder, self-consciousness, hallucination, and paranoia.
This is also said to happen to esoteric practioners and sorcerers who do not properly cultivate.
Diagnosis.
While the Chinese Society of Psychiatry prefers the term "qigong deviation", the American Psychiatric Association uses psychosis terminology.
Some physicians believe that this disease can be categorized as a culture-bound syndrome, but this point is debated.
Chinese psychiatry.
In the second edition of the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (CCMD-2) published by the Chinese Society of Psychiatry the diagnosis of “Qigong Deviation Syndrome” is based upon the following criteria: 
Western psychiatry.
In the West, there was no equivalent experience until the adoption of qigong practices by the public became more common.
When the Western medical community encountered abnormal conditions presenting in patients practicing qigong, they used the term "Qi-gong psychotic reaction" and classified the disorder as a culture-bound syndrome in the 4th edition of the "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual" (DSM-IV) of the American Psychiatric Association.
It is described as 
In order to diagnose this disease in the West, practitioners determine the cultural formation of the patient; this includes their cultural reference group and how that culture might explain their illness.
The DSM-IV classification has been criticized by other Western psychiatrists on the grounds that 
Medical causes.
The appearance of symptoms during or after qigong practice has been explained in various ways by the psychiatric community, in severe cases as an indication of latent psychosis.
The Chinese medical literature includes a wider variety of symptoms associated with qigong deviation; the non-psychotic symptoms correspond to conversion disorder and histrionic personality disorder in Western classifications.
Latent psychosis.
In cases of psychosis, a Western psychiatric belief is that qigong could be a precipitating stressor of a latent psychotic disorder to which the patient is predisposed, rather than erroneous qigong practice; a type of reactive psychosis or the precipitation of an underlying mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or posttraumatic stress disorder.
Qigong community perspective.
Within the qigong community, Zou huo ru mo is believed to be caused by improper practice: 
Treatment.
Within the qigong community, there are specific treatments believed to be effective for addressing different forms of Zou huo ru mo.
In particular, depending upon somatic versus psychological symptoms, and whether the condition is considered temporary or an intrinsic mental disorder, self-correction treatments can involve relaxation, walking, self-vibrating, self-patting, and self-massage.
Clinical treatments can involve psychological counseling, expert guidance of practice, acupuncture, massage, "external qi" treatments, and symptomatic correction.
Social and political context.
Qigong deviation became part of political controversy during the 1990s, when the Chinese government became concerned about loss of state control due to widespread popularity of qigong, mass practice, and rise to power of charismatic qigong "grandmasters".
Om Swami 
Om Swami is a spiritual leader and bestselling author who resides in his ashram in the Himalayan foothills.
He is the founder of the Black Lotus App and os.me, a writing platform.
Before renunciation, he was a successful tech entrepreneur.
Swami is the bestselling author of more than fifteen books on meditation, wellness, and spirituality, such as "Kundalini: An Untold Story", "The Wellness Sense", and "If Truth Be Told: A Monk's Memoir."
He has also documented his experiences on meditation for over 15,000 hours in his well-received book "A Million Thoughts".
Early life.
Swami was born on the twelfth night of the waxing moon in the month of Margasirsa, according to the Vedic calendar.
Showing deep inclination towards spirituality from an early age, Swami studied a range of Vedic and astrological texts, eventually becoming a professional astrologer during his teen years.
He quit his job as a part-time editor for a weekly business newspaper to pursue graduation and post-graduation degrees from Australia.
Later, he acquired Australian citizenship.
Education and early career.
In 2000, Swami graduated with a Bachelor of Business from University of Western Sydney.
He acquired Master of Business Administration from University of Technology Sydney.
Later, he started a software business in Australia and expanded its operations to the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and India over the next six years.
He became a millionaire owing to his IT company.
Later, Swami moved back to India and acquired a healthcare company.
Renunciation and spiritual journey.
On 15 March 2010, Swami renounced his material wealth and left for his spiritual journey quietly.
Heading straight to Kashi, he was initiated into the path of renunciation by a Naga saint in a little village some eighty kilometers from Varanasi.
After spending four and a half months there, Swami left for the Himalayas where he spent the next thirteen months in intense meditation in complete isolation and solitude.
During the days of his intense practice, he meditated for up to 22 hours every day including straight 10-hour stretches.
Researchers and Scientists from IIT studied the effects of his intense spiritual practices (tapasya) and published the findings in 2019 research papers.
Views.
Swami gives his own perspective on enlightenment on his website and in his book "If Truth Be Told".
"Enlightenment does not mean you have to live like a pauper.
It does not mean you have to subject yourself to a life of hardship and abstinence.
On the contrary, to be enlightened means to live in the light of love, compassion and truthfulness".
Literary work.
"If Truth Be Told: A Monk's Memoir" is his memoir, published by HarperCollins in December 2014.
The book was listed as number 6 in the top 10 non fiction books in the country as reported by The Financial Express (India).
His fictional novel "The Last Gambit" was translated as "La vie est un jeu d'échecs" in French.
It won the Chronos Prize for Literature (2019) in France.
Jeongang 
The Great Zen Master Jeongang Yeongshin ( ; 1898 1975) was a Zen Master of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism.
He used the principle of Kong-an () as a way to lead his disciples to Enlightenment.
Career.
Zen Master Jeongang entered the Hae In Temple monastery (해인사) to become a monk when he was 16 years old and after 7 years of intense self-training he attained Enlightenment.
At age 25, he received Dharma Transmission from Zen Master Mangong.
Zen Master Jeongang later became the ‘Josil’, or supreme patriarch, of Tongdo Temple when he was 33, the youngest in the history of Korean Buddhism.
These achievements at such a young age are legendary in Korean Buddhism.
Later he acted as Josil in the mediation halls of many famous temples within Korea including; Beobjusa, Mangwolsa, Donghwasa, Beomeosa, Cheonchuksa, Yongjusa and Jeonggaksa.
Dharma Transmission (Inga).
After receiving Dharma Transmission from Zen Master Mangong, Zen Master Jeongang’s Enlightenment was confirmed and recognized by 6 Zen Masters of the time in Korea: Masters Hyebong, Hyewol, Hanam, Geumbong, Bowol and Yongseong.
Death (Nirvana).
On January 13, 1975, while giving a Dharma Lecture in the meditation hall at Yonghwa Temple, Beopbo, Zen Master Jeongang asked the audience, "What is the purpose of life and death?".
When nobody answered, he said, "Hak!
Even backwards, 9 times 9 is 81.At that very moment he is said to have attained Nirvana"  
Nididhyāsana 
In Advaita Vedanta and Jnana Yoga Nididhyasana (Sanskrit: निदिध्यासन) is profound and repeated meditation on the mahavakyas, great Upanishadic statements such as "That art Thou", to realize the identity of Atman and Brahman.
It is the fourth step in the training of a sisya (disciple), consisting of preparatory practices, listening to the teachings as contained in the sruti, reflection on the teachings, and nididhyasana.
Four stages of practice.
Nididhyasana is the final step in the correct understanding of the meaning of the Mahavakyas.
Classical Advaita Vedanta emphasises the path of Jnana Yoga, a progression of study and training to attain moksha.
It consists of four stages: 
Nididhyasana is a rational and cognitive process, which differs from dhyana (meditation).
It is necessary for gaining "Brahmajnana": 
Nididhyasana done independently of "sravana" does not lead to the realization of the Atman.
Explanation.
Advaita Vedanta.
Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (II.iv.5) defines Nididhyasana as the meditation for the sake of direct vision.
Yajnavalkya tells his wife – 
Sankara explains Nididhyasana as meditation with determination.
Sankara states:- 
According to Suresvara, Nididhyasana is the culmination of the practice of "sravana" and "manana", which is an indirect intuition of Brahman and does not mean meditation but knowledge (vijnana) i.e. understanding the meaning of the Sruti on the basis of "vacya-vacaka" relation underlying the mahavakya.
Suresvara states:- 
Nididhyasana consists in acquisition of "vakyarthajnana" and this verse explains the purport of "sunisnata".
According to Vacaspati, "sravana", "manana" and "nidihyasana" are a chain of causes contributory to the knowledge of the oneness of Brahman.
The Vivarna school considers "sravana" as the principal cause but Suresvara treats "sravana" and "manana" to be co-existent, these two culminate into "nididhyasana".
Dvaita Vedanta.
According to Madhva the knowledge acquired by study ('śravaṇa') and stabilized by reflection ('manana') is made the basis of steady contemplation ('nididhyasana'); these are the three stages of inquiry that take the form of "Dhyana".
Radhakrishnan has defined Nididhyasana as "the process by which intellectual conscience is transformed into a vital one there is stillness, a calm in which the soul lays itself open to the Divine".
Neo-Vedanta.
According to Michael James, who gives an Advaita Vedanta interpretation of Ramana Maharshi, Ramana's self-enquiry is the same as Nididhyasana and "atma-vichara".
Brahmamuhurtha 
Brahmamuhurta (Sanskrit-ब्रह्म मुहूर्त, ) is a 48-minute period ("muhurta") that begins one hour and 36 minutes before sunrise, and ends 48 minutes before sunrise.
It is traditionally the penultimate phase or "muhurta" of the night, and is considered an auspicious time for all practices of yoga and most appropriate for meditation, worship or any other religious practice.
Spiritual activities performed early in the morning are said to have a greater effect than in any other part of the day.
"Brahmamuhurtha" is the 14th "muhurtha kala" of the night.
One "muhurtha" is a period of 48 minutes, with a whole night consisting of 15 muhurthas.
The time of sunrise varies each day, according to geographic location and time of year, and the time of the "Brahmamuhurta" varies with it.
For example, if sunrise is at 6:00 am, the "brahmamuhurta" begins at 4:24 am and ends at 5:12 am.
In yoga.
Ayurveda medicine states that there are three "doshas" found in the human physical body, called "Vata" (air and ether), "Pitta" (fire and water) and "Kapha" (earth and water).
The increase or decrease of these three "doshas" is related to the cycles of time.
From sunrise until 10:00am is the time of "Kapha"; from 10:00am until 2:00pm is the time of "Pitta"; and from 2:00pm until 6:00pm (sunset) is the time of "Vata".
The evening follows a similar pattern, with the period from 2:00am until 6:00am (sunrise) being "Vata" time.
"Brahmamuhurtha" occurs during this phase, and yoga masters state that the best time to meditate is one and a half hours before dawn, because the mind is inherently still at that time, enabling one to achieve a deeper meditative state.
Yoga teacher Tirumalai Krishnamacharya stated "Think of God.
If not God, the sun, if not the sun, your parents."
Krishnamacharya identified himself with Vaishnavism, or the worship of bhagwān Vishnu, as did Annanta, under the guidance of Shiva, who is the first yogi.
A modern Yogi would then show reverence to the sun.
In the Kali Yuga, divinity can still be reached through yoga, but because of the agitated mind associated with the Yuga, Yoga must be practiced through Kriya, based on asana.
It is therefore common for modern yogis whose lineage can be traced to Krishnamacharya to practice the Suryanamaskara, or sun salutation, in the morning.
The Suryanamaskara can be used in ritual cleansing practice that uses the mind states associated with 'Vata' in Ayurveda medicine.
These mind states are mentioned in "Patanjali's Yoga Sutras" These qualities are nearer to the divine, as they pertain to stillness of the mind, which allows for the spirit to shine.
It is because of the inherently stiller state of mind in "Brahmamuhurtha", that meditative states can be more easily achieved.
Mindfulness and technology 
Mindfulness and technology is a movement in research and design, that encourages the user to become aware of the present moment, rather than losing oneself in a technological device.
This field encompasses multidisciplinary participation between design, psychology, computer science, and religion.
Mindfulness stems from Buddhist meditation practices and refers to the awareness that arises through paying attention on purpose in the present moment, and in a non-judgmental mindset.
In the field of Human-Computer Interaction, research is being done on "Techno-spirituality" — the study of how technology can facilitate feelings of awe, wonder, transcendence, and mindfulness and on "Slow design", which facilitates self-reflection.
The excessive use of personal devices, such as smartphones and laptops, can lead to the deterioration of mental and physical health.
This area focuses on redesigning and creating technology to improve the wellbeing of its users.
Mindfulness theory.
In 1979, Jon Kabat-Zinn founded the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program at the University of Massachusetts to treat the chronically ill.
He is noted to be responsible for the popularization of mindfulness in Western culture.
The program uses a combination of mindfulness meditation, body awareness, and yoga.
These practices derived from teachings of the Eastern World, specifically Buddhist traditions.
Researchers found that enhanced mindfulness through the program partly mediated the association between increased daily spiritual experiences and improved mental-health-related quality of life.
Early studies of mindfulness focused on health issues related to psychosomatic and psychiatric disorders, while later studies of mindfulness explore the business sector, showing an increase in creativity and a decrease in burnout.
Studies on the relationship between mindfulness and technology are fairly new, with some of the more recent research highlighting the importance the practice plays in safety.
Technology.
Software.
Neurofeedback makes conditions like attention, stress, arousal or mind-wandering visible.
Real-time feedback leads to operant conditioning, a new form of learning which makes learning new techniques like Mindfulness and Meditation easier.
There are several applications for desktop and mobile to help users bring themselves back to the present moment, best known of which are Yours App, Calm, Headspace.
One of these mobile apps has been shown through a randomized controlled trial to help alleviate acute stress, while improving mood; and may provide long-term benefits on attentional control.
Mindfulness Bell.
According to Vietnamese Zen teacher Thich Nhat Hanh, the ringing of a bell every 15 minutes is an effective way to cultivate the mindfulness practice and connect back with the body.
The Mindfulness Bell and Mindful Mynah applications simulate the bell on the user's personal device.
Meditation.
The Frontiers in Human Neurosciences, published November 2012, proves that emotional reactivity can be down-regulated with Mindful Attention training.
Changes in brain activity by meditating, stay in everyday life, not just when meditating.
Thus, meditation changes the mental function, whereas more practice facilitates more change.
A 2011 brain imaging study, published in the "Journal of Neuroscience", found that even very brief instruction in mindfulness meditation (four 20-minute sessions) was effective in relieving pain by reducing the brain's emotional response to painful stimuli.
To help make meditation and mindfulness more accessible, developers have created digital health platforms, such as Am Mindfulness, Headspace, Insight Timer and Buddhify.
Currently, Am Mindfulness is the only commercially available meditation app that has outperformed placebos in randomized controlled trials.
Wearables.
There are several wearables which measures the breath in order to connect the user back to their body.
Wo.Defy is a dress which attempts to reveal the beauty of emotional communication using the common platform of the human breath; proposing the best methods of human to human communication lie within us.
Spire measures your breathing patterns to give you insights into your state of mind.
Being, the mindfulness tracker from Zensorium, maps user's emotions (stressed, excited normal and calm) through heart rate variability.
WellBe monitors heart rate levels and then matches them, through a patent pending algorithm, to specific moments and interactions throughout a user's day.
SmartMat is a responsive mat embedded with 21,000 sensors to detect your body's balance, pressure and alignment.
Prana's platform evaluates breath patterns, takes into account the effects of posture on breathing, and differentiates between diaphragmatic and chest breathing, three critical components of assessing the true quality of breathing, previously unaddressed by systems such as spirometers or pulse oximeters.
Virtual Reality.
Sonic Cradle enables users to shape sound with their breath while suspended in a completely dark chamber.
The researchers conducted a qualitative study with 39 participants to show how persuasive media has the potential to promote long-term psychological health by experientially introducing a stress-relieving, contemplative practice to non-practitioners.
Because the nature of chronic pain is complex, pharmacological analgesics are often not enough to achieve an ideal treatment plan.
The system incorporates biofeedback sensors, an immersive virtual environment, and stereoscopic sound titled the "Virtual Meditative Walk" (VMW).
It was designed to enable chronic pain patients to learn Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a form of meditation.
By providing real-time visual and sonic feedback, VMW enables patients to learn how to manage their pain.
Techno-spirituality.
Intel anthropologist Genevieve Bell has urged the human-computer interaction (HCI) research community to devote more research to the use of technology in spirituality and religion.
Techno-spirituality is the study of how technology can facilitate feelings of awe, wonder, transcendence, and mindfulness.
Currently, there are 6,000 applications related to spirituality and religion.
This area is in high demand and “important under-explored areas of HCI research”.
Inspired by Bell's work, researchers (Sterling &amp; Zimmerman) focused on how mobile phones could be incorporated in American Soto Zen Buddhist community, without conflicting with their philosophy of “the here and the now”.
They were able to find three ways to use technology to help strengthen ties within the community.
Interaction Design.
Slow Design.
Slow design is a design agenda for technology aimed at reflection and moments of mental rest rather than efficiency in performance.
Mindful Design.
Mindful design, based on Langer’s theory of mindfulness, is a design philosophy that incorporates the idea of mindfulness into creating meaningful user oriented design.
A major tenant is the behavior change of a user through awareness and responsibility of meaningful interactions between user and designed object, and this will encourage more desirable human practices.
This type of mind behavior driven change has been most heavily incorporated design for sustainability.
Other approaches include crime prevention or health.
It is also seen in the design of safety objects and the social interaction of performative objects.
Performative objects are identified as design objects that are designed to facilitate mindful awareness of the physical and symbolic social actions and their consequences within which they are used.
Mindfulness and Silicon Valley.
Classes in mindfulness practices have become part of some of Silicon Valleys major tech giants.
Google has implemented a series of bimonthly "mindfulness lunches" as well as built a labyrinth for walking meditations.
Both Twitter and Facebook have incorporated contemplative practices into their corporate culture.
The desired outcome of using mindfulness in the tech workforce is to increase communication and develop the emotional intelligence of their employees.
Fullmind advanced mindfulness training for employees and managers uses neurofeedback technology in a group application.
Collective neurofeedback allows tracking of the training outcome and makes health management with mindfulness training measurable.
Internet Addiction and Mindfulness.
Mindfulness is currently being explored by researchers as a possible treatment for technological addiction, also known as Internet addiction disorder, a form of behavioral addiction.
There has been some consensus in the field of psychology on the benefits of using mindfulness to treat behavioral addiction.
Experts in the field say in order to treat technology addiction with mindfulness, one must be non-judgmental about the behavior and pay attention in order to recognize instances in which technology is being used mindlessly.
Then reflect on the helpfulness of the device, and notice the benefits of disconnecting.
The three keystones of mindfulness are: Intention, Attention and Action.
Technology is said to interfere with mindfulness by causing the individual to forget what matters (intention), the distracts (attention), and then keeps the individual from taking action.
In technological addiction, the reward system, located in the mid-brain and underlies addiction, evolved to rewards finding and consuming food.
In complex animals this evolution also rewards the exchange of information within the social group.
In humans this has developed into its current form of mass worldwide communication.
The exchange of social information has demonstrated reward based reinforcement, similar to that of gamification.
Criticisms.
Critics of the mindfulness movement in technology focus on several key areas, technophobia, pacifications of genuine grievances in the workforce and disconnection from religious roots.
The editor of the New Republic, Eygeny Morozov, questions the value of tech companies who advocate "unplugging" from the modern digital lifestyle as similar to a drug addict taking a tolerance break from the substance they are addicted to in order to then increase the vigor with which those activities are then resumed (3, 4).
They also state that the concept of Mindfulness in the tech world is jargonistic and amorphous.
Mobile.
Mobile meditation applications like Calm, Headspace and MyLife have over a million users and are increasing in popularity.
Swedish Researchers found that downloading and using the applications for eight weeks made little to no difference for people with major depression and anxiety.
They did, however, see improvements with a subgroup with mild levels of depression.
Disconnectionists.
Criticisms of the slow technology movement are similar to the slow-food movement; it lacks understanding of global scope, and as an individualistic response will not answer the actual problems in technology.
This movement has been dubbed by critics as disconnectionists.
Mindfulness in technology has been criticized as being less about restoring self and more about stifling autonomy that technology inspires.
Anti-disconnectionists state mindfulness and the expressed need to disconnect from technology and the modern world can be accused of being a nostalgia-manipulating marketing tactic and maybe a technological form of conservatism.
Critics state that the labeling of digital connection as debasing and unnatural is in direct proportion to the rapidity of adoption.
Thus it is depicted as a dangerous desire and toxin to be regulated.
This argument itself can be tied back to rationalization, Walter Benjamin on aura, Jacques Ellul on technique, Jean Baudrillard on simulations, or Zygmunt Bauman and the Frankfurt School on modernity and the Enlightenment.
Critics state that disconnectionists see the Internet as having normalized or enforced a repression of an authentic self in favor of a social media avatar.
Thus reflecting the desire to connect with a deeper self, which may itself be an illusion.
The pathologization of technology use then opens the door for Foucault's idea of "normalization" to be applied to technology in similar fashion as other social ills, which then can become a concept around which social control and management can be applied.
Buddhist concerns.
There is some concern among Buddhist practitioners that decoupling meditation and mindfulness from the core tenement of Buddhism may have negative effects.
The wide adoption of mindfulness in technology and the tech industry has been accused of increasing passivity in the worker by creating a calm mindstate which then allows for disconnection from actual grievances.
Critics of mindfulness in Cognitive Behavior Therapy also comment on this as a possible problem.
However, critics of the movement, such as Ronald Purser, fear that the secularization of mindfulness, dubbed McMindfulness, leads to reinforcement of anti-Buddhist ideas.
Buddhists differentiate between Right Mindfulness (samma sati) and Wrong Mindfulness (miccha sati).
The distinction is not moralistic: the issue is whether the quality of awareness is characterized by wholesome intentions and positive mental qualities that lead to human flourishing and optimal well-being for others as well as oneself.
Mindfulness as adopted by the Silicon Valley tech giants has been criticized as conveniently shifting the burden of stress and toxic work environment onto the individual employee.
Obfuscated by the seemingly inherent qualities of care and humanity, mindfulness is refashioned into a way of coping with and adapting to the stresses and strains of corporate life rather than actually solving them.
Brainwave entrainment 
Brainwave entrainment, also referred to as brainwave synchronization or neural entrainment, refers to the observation that brainwaves (large-scale electrical oscillations in the brain) will naturally synchronize to the rhythm of periodic external stimuli, such as flickering lights, speech, music, or tactile stimuli.
As different conscious states can be associated with different dominant brainwave frequencies, it is hypothesized that brainwave entrainment might induce a desired state.
Researchers have found, for instance, that acoustic entrainment of delta waves in slow wave sleep had the functional effect of improving memory in healthy subjects.
Neural oscillation.
Neural oscillations are rhythmic or repetitive electrochemical activity in the brain and central nervous system.
Such oscillations can be characterized by their frequency, amplitude and phase.
Neural tissue can generate oscillatory activity driven by mechanisms within individual neurons, as well as by interactions between them.
They may also adjust frequency to synchronize with the periodic vibration of external acoustic or visual stimuli.
The activity of neurons generate electric currents; and the synchronous action of neural ensembles in the cerebral cortex, comprising large numbers of neurons, produce macroscopic oscillations.
These phenomena can be monitored and graphically documented by an electroencephalogram (EEG).
The electroencephalographic representations of those oscillations are typically denoted by the term 'brainwaves' in common parlance.
The technique of recording neural electrical activity within the brain from electrochemical readings taken from the scalp originated with the experiments of Richard Caton in 1875, whose findings were developed into electroencephalography (EEG) by Hans Berger in the late 1920s.
Neural oscillation and cognitive functions.
The functional role of neural oscillations is still not fully understood; however they have been shown to correlate with emotional responses, motor control, and a number of cognitive functions including information transfer, perception, and memory.
Specifically, neural oscillations, in particular theta activity, are extensively linked to memory function, and coupling between theta and gamma activity is considered to be vital for memory functions, including episodic memory.
Etymology.
Entrainment is a term originally derived from complex systems theory.
The theory explains the way that two or more independent, autonomous oscillators with differing rhythms or frequencies, when situated in proximity where they can interact for long enough, influence each other mutually, to a degree dependent on coupling force.
They then adjust until both oscillate with the same frequency.
Examples include the mechanical entrainment or cyclic synchronization of two electric clothes dryers placed in close proximity, and the biological entrainment evident in the synchronized illumination of fireflies.
Entrainment is a concept first identified by the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens in 1665 who discovered the phenomenon during an experiment with pendulum clocks: He set them each in motion and found that when he returned the next day, the sway of their pendulums had all synchronized.
Such entrainment occurs because small amounts of energy are transferred between the two systems when they are out of phase in such a way as to produce negative feedback.
As they assume a more stable phase relationship, the amount of energy gradually reduces to zero, with systems of greater frequency slowing down, and the other speeding up.
The term 'entrainment' has been used to describe a shared tendency of many physical and biological systems to synchronize their periodicity and rhythm through interaction.
This tendency has been identified as specifically pertinent to the study of sound and music generally, and acoustic rhythms specifically.
The most familiar examples of neuromotor entrainment to acoustic stimuli is observable in spontaneous foot or finger tapping to the rhythmic beat of a song.
Brainwaves, or neural oscillations, share the fundamental constituents with acoustic and optical waves, including frequency, amplitude and periodicity.
Consequently, Huygens' discovery precipitated inquiry into whether or not the synchronous electrical activity of cortical neural ensembles might not only alter in response to external acoustic or optical stimuli but also entrain or synchronize their frequency to that of a specific stimulus.
Brainwave entrainment is a colloquialism for 'neural entrainment', which is a term used to denote the way in which the aggregate frequency of oscillations produced by the synchronous electrical activity in ensembles of cortical neurons can adjust to synchronize with the periodic vibration of external stimuli, such as a sustained acoustic frequency perceived as pitch, a regularly repeating pattern of intermittent sounds, perceived as rhythm, or of a regularly rhythmically intermittent flashing light.
Chakra 


Chakras (, ; ; ) are various focal points used in a variety of ancient meditation practices, collectively denominated as Tantra, or the esoteric or inner traditions of Hinduism.
The concept of the chakra arose in the early traditions of Hinduism.
Beliefs differ between the Indian religions, with many Buddhist texts consistently mentioning five chakras, while Hindu sources reference six or seven.
Early Sanskrit texts speak of them both as meditative visualizations combining flowers and mantras and as physical entities in the body.
Within Kundalini yoga, the techniques of breathing exercises, visualizations, mudras, bandhas, kriyas, and mantras are focused on manipulating the flow of subtle energy through chakras.
The modern Western chakra system arose from multiple sources, starting in the 1880s with H. P. Blavatsky and other Theosophists, followed by Sir John Woodroffe's 1919 book "The Serpent Power", and Charles W. Leadbeater's 1927 book "The Chakras".
Psychological and other attributes, rainbow colours, and a wide range of supposed correspondences with other systems such as alchemy, astrology, gemstones, homeopathy, Kabbalah and Tarot were added later.
Etymology.
Lexically, "chakra" is the Indic reflex of an ancestral Indo-European form "*kʷékʷlos", whence also "wheel" and "cycle" ().
It has both literal and metaphorical uses, as in the "wheel of time" or "wheel of dharma", such as in "Rigveda" hymn verse 1.164.11, pervasive in the earliest Vedic texts.
In Buddhism, especially in Theravada, the Pali noun "cakka" connotes "wheel".
Within the central "Tripitaka", the Buddha variously refers the "dhammacakka", or "wheel of dharma", connoting that this dharma, universal in its advocacy, should bear the marks characteristic of any temporal dispensation.
The Buddha spoke of freedom from cycles in and of themselves, whether karmic, reincarnative, liberative, cognitive or emotional.
In Jainism, the term "chakra" also means "wheel" and appears in various contexts in its ancient literature.
As in other Indian religions, "chakra" in esoteric theories in Jainism such as those by Buddhisagarsuri means a yogic energy center.
Ancient history.
The term "chakra" appears to first emerge within the Hindu Vedas, though not precisely in the sense of psychic energy centers, rather as "chakravartin" or the king who "turns the wheel of his empire" in all directions from a center, representing his influence and power.
The iconography popular in representing the "Chakras", states the scholar David Gordon White, traces back to the five symbols of yajna, the Vedic fire altar: "square, circle, triangle, half moon and dumpling".
The hymn 10.136 of the "Rigveda" mentions a renunciate yogi with a female named "kunamnama".
Literally, it means "she who is bent, coiled", representing both a minor goddess and one of many embedded enigmas and esoteric riddles within the "Rigveda".
Some scholars, such as D.G. White and Georg Feuerstein, have suggested that she may be a reference to kundalini shakti and a precursor to the terminology associated with the chakras in later tantric traditions.
Breath channels (nāḍi) are mentioned in the classical Upanishads of Hinduism from the 1st millennium BCE, but not psychic-energy chakra theories.
Three classical Nadis are Ida, Pingala and Sushumna in which the central channel Sushumna is said to be foremost as per Kṣurikā-Upaniṣhad.
The latter, states David Gordon White, were introduced about 8th-century CE in Buddhist texts as hierarchies of inner energy centers, such as in the "Hevajra Tantra" and "Caryāgiti".
These are called by various terms such as "cakka", "padma" (lotus) or "pitha" (mound).
These medieval Buddhist texts mention only four chakras, while later Hindu texts such as the "Kubjikāmata" and "Kaulajñānanirnaya" expanded the list to many more.
In contrast to White, according to Feuerstein, early Upanishads of Hinduism do mention "chakras" in the sense of "psychospiritual vortices", along with other terms found in tantra: "prana" or "vayu" (life energy) along with "nadi" (energy carrying arteries).
According to Gavin Flood, the ancient texts do not present "chakra" and kundalini-style yoga theories although these words appear in the earliest Vedic literature in many contexts.
The "chakra" in the sense of four or more vital energy centers appear in the medieval era Hindu and Buddhist texts.
Overview.
The Chakras are part of esoteric ideas and concepts about physiology and psychic centers that emerged across Indian traditions.
The belief held that human life simultaneously exists in two parallel dimensions, one "physical body" ("sthula sarira") and other "psychological, emotional, mind, non-physical" it is called the "subtle body" ("sukshma sarira").
This subtle body is energy, while the physical body is mass.
The psyche or mind plane corresponds to and interacts with the body plane, and the belief holds that the body and the mind mutually affect each other.
The subtle body consists of nadi (energy channels) connected by nodes of psychic energy called "chakra".
The belief grew into extensive elaboration, with some suggesting 88,000 chakras throughout the subtle body.
The number of major chakras varied between various traditions, but they typically ranged between four and seven.
Nyingmapa Vajrayana Buddhist teachings mention eight chakras and there is a complete yogic system for each of them.
The important chakras are stated in Hindu and Buddhist texts to be arranged in a column along the spinal cord, from its base to the top of the head, connected by vertical channels.
The tantric traditions sought to master them, awaken and energize them through various breathing exercises or with assistance of a teacher.
These chakras were also symbolically mapped to specific human physiological capacity, seed syllables (bija), sounds, subtle elements (tanmatra), in some cases deities, colors and other motifs.
Belief in the chakra system of Hinduism and Buddhism differs from the historic Chinese system of meridians in acupuncture.
Unlike the latter, the "chakra" relates to subtle body, wherein it has a position but no definite nervous node or precise physical connection.
The tantric systems envision it as continually present, highly relevant and a means to psychic and emotional energy.
It is useful in a type of yogic rituals and meditative discovery of radiant inner energy ("prana" flows) and mind-body connections.
The meditation is aided by extensive symbology, mantras, diagrams, models (deity and mandala).
The practitioner proceeds step by step from perceptible models, to increasingly abstract models where deity and external mandala are abandoned, inner self and internal mandalas are awakened.
These ideas are not unique to Hindu and Buddhist traditions.
Similar and overlapping concepts emerged in other cultures in the East and the West, and these are variously called by other names such as subtle body, spirit body, esoteric anatomy, sidereal body and etheric body.
According to Geoffrey Samuel and Jay Johnston, professors of Religious studies known for their studies on Yoga and esoteric traditions: 
Contrast with classical yoga.
Chakra and related beliefs have been important to the esoteric traditions, but they are not directly related to mainstream yoga.
According to the Indologist Edwin Bryant and other scholars, the goals of classical yoga such as spiritual liberation (freedom, self-knowledge, moksha) is "attained entirely differently in classical yoga, and the "cakra / nadi / kundalini" physiology is completely peripheral to it."
Number of chakras.
There is no consensus in Hinduism about the number of chakras because the concept of chakras has been evolved and interpreted differently by various sects, schools of thought, and spiritual traditions within Hinduism over the centuries.
While some traditions follow the seven main chakra system as described in Patanjali's Yoga Sutra, others recognize additional chakras or a different number of chakras.
The lack of a universally accepted standard has led to variation and diversity in the interpretation and understanding of chakras within Hinduism.
There are several sects within Hinduism that have their own unique interpretations and understandings of the concept of chakras.
Here are some of the major sects that have different perspectives on chakras: 
Classical traditions.
The classical eastern traditions, particularly those that developed in India during the 1st millennium AD, primarily describe "nadi" and "chakra" in a "subtle body" context.
To them, they are in same dimension as of the psyche-mind reality that is invisible yet real.
In the "nadi" and "cakra" flow the "prana" (breath, life energy).
The concept of "life energy" varies between the texts, ranging from simple inhalation-exhalation to far more complex association with breath-mind-emotions-sexual energy.
This prana or essence is what vanishes when a person dies, leaving a gross body.
Some of this concept states this subtle body is what withdraws within, when one sleeps.
All of it is believed to be reachable, awake-able and important for an individual's body-mind health, and how one relates to other people in one's life.
This subtle body network of "nadi" and "chakra" is, according to some later Indian theories and many new age speculations, closely associated with emotions.
Hindu Tantra.
Esoteric traditions in Hinduism mention numerous numbers and arrangements of chakras, of which a classical system of six-plus-one, the last being the Sahasrara, is most prevalent.
This seven-part system, central to the core texts of hatha yoga, is one among many systems found in Hindu tantric literature.
Hindu Tantra associates six Yoginis with six places in the subtle body, corresponding to the six chakras of the six-plus-one system.
The Chakra methodology is extensively developed in the goddess tradition of Hinduism called Shaktism.
It is an important concept along with yantras, mandalas and kundalini yoga in its practice.
Chakra in Shakta tantrism means circle, an "energy center" within, as well as being a term for group rituals such as in "chakra-puja" (worship within a circle) which may or may not involve tantra practice.
The cakra-based system is a part of the meditative exercises that came to be known as yoga.
Buddhist Tantra.
The esoteric traditions in Buddhism generally teach four chakras.
In some early Buddhist sources, these chakras are identified as: manipura (navel), anahata (heart), vishuddha (throat) and ushnisha kamala (crown).
In one development within the Nyingma lineage of the "Mantrayana" of Tibetan Buddhism a popular conceptualization of chakras in increasing subtlety and increasing order is as follows: Nirmanakaya (gross self), Sambhogakaya (subtle self), Dharmakaya (causal self), and Mahasukhakaya (non-dual self), each vaguely and indirectly corresponding to the categories within the Shaiva "Mantramarga" universe, i.e., Svadhisthana, Anahata, Visuddha, Sahasrara, etc.
However, depending on the meditational tradition, these vary between three and six.
The chakras are considered psycho-spiritual constituents, each bearing meaningful correspondences to cosmic processes and their postulated Buddha counterpart.
A system of five chakras is common among the Mother class of Tantras and these five chakras along with their correspondences are: 
Chakras clearly play a key role in Tibetan Buddhism, and are considered to be the pivotal providence of Tantric thinking.
And, the precise use of the chakras across the gamut of tantric sadhanas gives little space to doubt the primary efficacy of Tibetan Buddhism as distinct religious agency, that being that precise revelation that, without Tantra there would be no Chakras, but more importantly, without Chakras, there is no Tibetan Buddhism.
The highest practices in Tibetan Buddhism point to the ability to bring the subtle pranas of an entity into alignment with the central channel, and to thus penetrate the realisation of the ultimate unity, namely, the "organic harmony" of one's individual consciousness of Wisdom with the co-attainment of All-embracing Love, thus synthesizing a direct cognition of absolute Buddhahood.
According to Samuel, the buddhist esoteric systems developed cakra and nadi as "central to their soteriological process".
The theories were sometimes, but not always, coupled with a unique system of physical exercises, called "yantra yoga" or "phrul khor".
Chakras, according to the Bon tradition, enable the gestalt of experience, with each of the five major chakras, being psychologically linked with the five experiential qualities of unenlightened consciousness, the six realms of woe.
The tsa lung practice embodied in the Trul khor lineage, unbaffles the primary channels, thus activating and circulating liberating prana.
Yoga awakens the deep mind, thus bringing forth positive attributes, inherent gestalts, and virtuous qualities.
In a computer analogy, the screen of one's consciousness is slated and an attribute-bearing file is called up that contains necessary positive or negative, supportive qualities.
Tantric practice is said to eventually transform all experience into clear light.
The practice aims to liberate from all negative conditioning, and the deep cognitive salvation of freedom from control and unity of perception and cognition.
The seven chakra system.
The more common and most studied chakra system incorporates six major chakras along with a seventh center generally not regarded as a chakra.
These points are arranged vertically along the axial channel (sushumna nadi in Hindu texts, Avadhuti in some Buddhist texts).
According to Gavin Flood, this system of six chakras plus the "sahasrara" "center" at the crown first appears in the "Kubjikāmata-tantra", an 11th-century Kaula work.
It was this chakra system that was translated in the early 20th century by Sir John Woodroffe (also called Arthur Avalon) in the text "The Serpent Power".
Avalon translated the Hindu text "Ṣaṭ-Cakra-Nirūpaṇa" meaning the examination (nirūpaṇa) of the seven (ṣaṭ) chakras (cakra).
The Chakras are traditionally considered meditation aids.
The yogi progresses from lower chakras to the highest chakra blossoming in the crown of the head, internalizing the journey of spiritual ascent.
In both the Hindu kundalini and Buddhist candali traditions, the chakras are pierced by a dormant energy residing near or in the lowest chakra.
In Hindu texts she is known as Kundalini, while in Buddhist texts she is called Candali or Tummo (Tibetan: "gtum mo", "fierce one").
Below are the common new age description of these six chakras and the seventh point known as sahasrara.
This new age version incorporates the Newtonian colors of the rainbow not found in any ancient Indian system.
Western chakra system.
History.
Kurt Leland, for the Theosophical Society in America, concluded that the western chakra system was produced by an "unintentional collaboration" of many groups of people: esotericists and clairvoyants, often theosophical; Indologists; the scholar of myth, Joseph Campbell; the founders of the Esalen Institute and the psychological tradition of Carl Jung; the colour system of Charles W. Leadbeater's 1927 book "The Chakras", treated as traditional lore by some modern Indian yogis; and energy healers such as Barbara Brennan.
Leland states that far from being traditional, the two main elements of the modern system, the rainbow colours and the list of qualities, first appeared together only in 1977.
The concept of a set of seven chakras came to the West in the 1880s; at that time each chakra was associated with a nerve plexus.
In 1918, Sir John Woodroffe, alias Arthur Avalon, translated two Indian texts, the "Ṣaṭ-Cakra-Nirūpaṇa" and the "Pādukā-Pañcaka", and in his book "The Serpent Power" drew Western attention to the seven chakra theory.
In the 1920s, each of the seven chakras was associated with an endocrine gland, a tradition that has persisted.
More recently, the lower six chakras have been linked to both nerve plexuses and glands.
The seven rainbow colours were added by Leadbeater in 1927; a variant system in the 1930s proposed six colours plus white.
Leadbeater's theory was influenced by Johann Georg Gichtel's 1696 book "Theosophia Practica", which mentioned inner "force centres".
Psychological and other attributes such as layers of the aura, developmental stages, associated diseases, Aristotelian elements, emotions, and states of consciousness were added still later.
A wide range of supposed correspondences such as with alchemical metals, astrological signs and planets, foods, herbs, gemstones, homeopathic remedies, Kabbalistic spheres, musical notes, totem animals, and Tarot cards have also been proposed.
New Age.
In "Anatomy of the Spirit" (1996), Caroline Myss described the function of chakras as follows: "Every thought and experience you've ever had in your life gets filtered through these chakra databases.
Each event is recorded into your cells...".
The chakras are described as being aligned in an ascending column from the base of the spine to the top of the head.
New Age practices often associate each chakra with a certain colour.
In various traditions, chakras are associated with multiple physiological functions, an aspect of consciousness, a classical element, and other distinguishing characteristics; these do not correspond to those used in ancient Indian systems.
The chakras are visualised as lotuses or flowers with a different number of petals in every chakra.
The chakras are thought to vitalise the physical body and to be associated with interactions of a physical, emotional and mental nature.
They are considered of life energy or prana (which New Age belief equates with "shakti", "qi" in Chinese, "ki "in Japanese, "koach-ha-guf" in Hebrew, "bios "in Greek, and "aether"" "in both Greek and English), which is thought to flow among them along pathways called nadi.
The function of the chakras is to spin and draw in this energy to keep the spiritual, mental, emotional and physical health of the body in balance.
Rudolf Steiner considered the chakra system to be dynamic and evolving.
He suggested that this system has become different for modern people than it was in ancient times and that it will, in turn, be radically different in future times.
Steiner described a sequence of development that begins with the upper chakras and moves down, rather than moving in the opposite direction.
He gave suggestions on how to develop the chakras through disciplining thoughts, feelings, and will.
According to Florin Lowndes, a "spiritual student" can further develop and deepen or elevate thinking consciousness when taking the step from the "ancient path" of schooling to the "new path" represented by Steiner's "The Philosophy of Freedom".
Skeptical response.
The not-for-profit Edinburgh Skeptics Society states that despite their popularity, "there has never been any evidence for these meridian lines or chakras".
It adds that while practitioners sometimes cite "scientific evidence" for their claims, such evidence is often "incredibly shaky".
The Varieties of the Meditative Experience 
The Varieties of the Meditative Experience is a 1977 book by American psychologist Daniel Goleman.
It was republished under the title The Meditative Mind in 1988.
Synopsis.
Visuddhimagga.
Goleman begins with an outline of the "Visuddhimagga" of Theravadan Buddhism.
Survey.
Goleman continues with a survey of eleven types of meditation including Hinduism, Judaism, Christianity, Sufism, Transcendental Meditation, Patanjali's Ashtanga Yoga, Indian Tantra and Kundalini Yoga, Tibetan Buddhism, Zen, the teachings of Gurdjieff as expressed by P. D. Ouspensky, and the teachings of Jiddu Krishnamurti.
Unity.
Goleman then draws some parallels between various methods, saying that they all share the goal of changing the practitioner's state of consciousness.
Each method may have a different word for the "awakened state": sahaj samadhi, Devekut, purity of heart, baqa, jivamukti, cosmic consciousness, turiyatita, siddha, bodhisattva, mujodo no taigeu, objective consciousness, choiceless awareness, arahantship.
All of them result in "one, single point" of concentration.
All except Krishnamurti propose an explicit doctrine that the student is expected to assimilate.
Abhidhamma model.
Next the author reviews Theravadan Buddhism's Abhidhamma which describes, in 53 categories (and in other schools of Buddhism up to 175 categories), how wholesome states of mind replace and cancel out unwholesome ones.
Which traits are wholesome was distilled empirically from a survey of a large number of early Buddhists who were asked whether each trait facilitated or detracted from their meditation efforts.
Goleman writes, "Each of the unhealthy factors is opposed by a healthy factor."
Eastern and Western psychology.
This becomes a basis for contrast between Eastern and Western psychology.
According to Goleman, Westerners study psychopathology, and the English language lacks the words needed to indicate nuances in consciousness.
Goleman searches through modern Western psychology and finds Sigmund Freud failed to ever read and study Eastern texts, and that behaviorist John B. Watson bemoaned what he saw as the substitution of consciousness for soul.
Goleman writes, "For the most part, Western psychologists have been reactive against Eastern psychologies".
More in tune are parts of Gordon Allport, Erik Erikson, Ernest Becker, and Franz Alexander.
Goleman finds parallels with Eastern psychologies in Plotinus and in Christian psychology in the writings of Anthony the Great, St. John of the Cross and Meister Eckhart.
He finds a sympathetic ear in William James, Carl Jung, Abraham Maslow, Andras Angyal, Medard Boss, Martin Buber, Erich Fromm, and in Alan Watts, Anthony Sutich, Charles Tart and in contemporary works by Ken Wilber, Jack Engler, Daniel P. Brown, and Mark Epstein.
Conclusion.
Goleman quickly covers contemporary research on meditation and also research on relaxation.
He ends with a discussion of "how to meditate".
Reaction.
"Publishers Weekly" wrote about the 1977 book: 
Apple iTunes says the 1988 book is "a comprehensive and easily accessed overview".
Jazz meditation 
Jazz meditation refers to guided meditation practice that incorporates live instrumental jazz music.
During a typical jazz meditation performance, a meditation guide or teacher is accompanied by one or more musicians, and musical improvisation is used as an anchor for mindfulness techniques such as visualization and breathing exercises.
An audience of seated participants meditate in response to live music and the teacher's spoken instructions.
History.
Roots in Buddhism and jazz.
Since the mid-20th Century, there has been an evolving relationship between jazz musicians and Buddhist meditative practices.
From the emergence of the Beat Generation artists in the post World War II era United States, through the counter-culture 1960s and New Age and experimental aesthetics of the late 20th Century, musicians have found rich inspiration as well as discipline in many of the same concepts that are fundamental to Buddhist practices.
Meditation concepts that have been integrated into jazz theory and performance include: being in the present moment; concentration; following the mind; following the breath; returning to the anchor concept of focus; placing priority on the action in the present, not in a theory.
Particular Buddhist teachings such as esoteric ideas of non-verbal deep insight and communication, and the benefits of chanting (rhythmic repetition of sound) - have strong analogues in jazz performance.
Several late 20th Century and contemporary jazz musicians have acknowledged drawing inspiration from meditation and Buddhist practices, including John Coltrane, John McLaughlin, Don Cherry, Wayne Shorter, Yusef Lateef, Sonny Rollins, and Herbie Hancock.
""When [John Coltrane] created A Love Supreme.
He had meditated that week.
I almost didn't see him downstairs.
And it was so quiet!
There was no sound, no practice!
He was up there meditating, and when he came down he said, "I have a whole new music!"
He said, "There is a new recording that I will do, I have it all, everything."
And it was so beautiful!
He was like Moses coming down from the mountain.
And when he recorded it, he knew everything, everything.
He said this was the first time that he had all the music in his head at once to record."
- Alice Coltrane" 
Contemporary practice.
Several academic institutions offer courses and degree programs linking contemplative practice with jazz, including the Berklee School of Music and the University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre &amp; Dance.
Verve Records' compilation album "Jazz for Meditation" was released in the UK in 2007.
Jazz meditation as a live music program originated at the Shinnyo Center for Meditation and Well-being in New York City and at the Mass Bliss Arts and Awareness Festival in the Berkshires.
Since 2015, the Festival Jazz à Saint-Germain-des-Prés Paris has been proposing "Jazz &amp; Meditation" sessions with a therapist specialized in MBSR (Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction), Elisabeth Petit-Lizop, and the Festival artistic director Frédéric Charbaut.
Affective meditation 
Affective meditation is a Christian spiritual practice originating in Medieval Europe by which a pilgrim, worshipper, or other follower of Christ seeks to imagine the sights, sounds, tastes, smells, movement, and tactility of specific scenes from canonical Gospels and their characters, with particular emphasis on empathising with the compassion and suffering of Jesus and the joys and sorrows of the Virgin Mary, leading to the authentic and spontaneous expression of emotion.
History.
Middle Ages.
Affective meditation is the spiritual practice around which the tradition and philosophy of affective piety revolves, and was initiated by Saint Anselm of Canterbury, subsequently by Bernard of Clairvaux, and latterly by Francis of Assisi, who are credited with spawning an expressive form of worship through which members of the clergy, monastic orders, and laity visualized and envisioned scenes from the life of Christ with which they empathized to such degree that their compassionate identification with the suffering of him and his mother Mary manifested in emotive vocal sounds and physical movements.
The following excerpt from a work by English writer, Abbot and saint Aelred of Rievaulx is indicative of instructions provided by Christians in the tradition of affective piety.
A further example comes from the writings of English hermit, mystic, and religious writer Richard Rolle, who expresses his empathy with the suffering of Christ in his work "Meditation on the Passion".
20th century onwards.
The experience of affective meditation is most often precipitated by meditating or concentrating attention on Christian drawings or paintings, music, or literature depicting the experience of Jesus and the Virgin Mary, until the meditator's empathy with the subjects of those depictions becomes sufficiently intense to precipitate emotive expression that may include tears and crying, vocal sounds and prayer, as well as bodily movements.
During the late 1970s, psychologist, Yoga teacher, and organist at Culbone Church Joan D'Arcy Cooper, began to explore using the stories told by and about Jesus as spoken scripts with which to lead members of the parish through visualizations and guided meditations in the tradition of affective meditation.
In 1982, Cooper published "Guided Meditation and the Teachings of Jesus" in which she suggests that the words of Jesus, as recorded in the canonical gospels, may perhaps have been intended to be considered, and are enriched by hearing or reading them as guided meditations, through which the reader or listener can meditate upon the message and meaning inherent in the text, and thereby come to know God.
While affective meditation is a marginal practice, Cooper's books and teachings, and the creative approach to Christian meditative practice that she encouraged, was acknowledged as making an important contribution to the New Age era and movement, characterized by a personal and individualist exploration of various meditative and contemplative traditions outside the boundaries and purview of formal doctrine and religious organizations, including those originating in Christianity, Hinduism, and Buddhism.
Amrit Velā 
Amrit Velā (, pronunciation: , ) does not refer to a specific time.
According to the "pahar" system of time, most Sikhs typically interpret this time to start at around 3:00am.
Guru Nanak in the Japji Sahib (4th Pauri) says, "in amrit velā meditate on the grandeur of the one true Name".
The importance of Amrit Vela is found throughout the Guru Granth Sahib.
The Guru Granth Sahib states that "those who consider themselves a Sikh must wake up daily at Amrit vela and be in tune with the "Naam" (the Lord's Name)" 
In the SPGC Sikh Rehat Maryada it is written to arise in the Amrit Velā, bath, and meditate on the divine "Naam" (through Simran and Naam Japna).
Here, Amrit Vela is defined as "three hours before the dawn".
Sikhs recite their morning "Nitnem" during Amrit vela.
Traditionally after "Nitnem" Sikhs meet with the Sangat (congregation) to recite Asa di Var. 
Dark retreat 
Dark retreat () is a spiritual retreat in a space that is completely absent of light, which is an advanced practice of Tibetan Buddhism and Bön.
Overview.
The dark retreat environment of the Bon religion is particularly conducive to the practice of certain visionary yogas (such as the “six-limbed yoga” of Kalacakra and the Dzogchen practice of "Thögal" for the attainment of the Rainbow Body), which according to Hatchell are "techniques that lead to the experience of spontaneously arising visual experiences, which are said to occur without deliberate effort or conceptual imagination, and which appear before the practitioner’s eyes."
According Hatchell, the Kalacakra system's six yogas:instruct the yogi to spend lengthy periods either gazing at the blank sky or residing in a dark room specially prepared to seal out all light.
Both of these are forms of sensory deprivation and result in a series of unstructured appearances of light—like sparks, fireflies, and so forth—that ultimately coalesce into a vision of deities, or the appearance of a luminous goddess known as the Great Seal (mahamudra, "phyag rgya chen mo").Regarding the Dzogchen tradition of visionary practice, Hatchell writes:While the Great Perfection contains a diversity of visionary yogas, their basic format bears many similarities to Kalacakra’s six yogas: an organizing theme of dark and light, the use of dark-retreat and sky-gazing, a sequence of visions that progresses from unstructured spots of light to encounters with fully formed deities, and a tendency to use these visions as the basis for philosophical discussion.Hatchell notes that there are major differences between the Kalachakra and Dzogchen system, including different "preliminary practices that prepare the yogi for vision" and "the details and sequences of the main practices" are also different.
Also, Dzogchen "presents a unique system of luminous energy channels that traverse the body’s interior and give rise to vision, a feature that is absent in Kalacakra."
The dark retreat practice is discussed in the various Kalachakra works, such as the "Stainless Light" Commentary.
It is also discussed in the Dzogchen tantra titled "Tantra of the Blazing Lamps" (sgron ma 'bar ba’i rgyud), one of the Seventeen Tantras.
Similar practices are also discussed in the "Advice on the Six Lamps" and its commentary by Drugom Gyalwa Yungdrung, which are part of Bon religion.
The time period dedicated to dark retreat varies from a few hours to decades.
Dark retreat in the Himalayan tradition is a restricted practice only to be engaged by the senior spiritual practitioner under appropriate spiritual guidance.
This practice is considered conducive for navigating the bardo at the time of death and for realizing the rainbow body.
The traditional dark retreat requires stability in the natural state and is only suitable for advanced practitioners.
Ayu Khandro and Dilgo Khyentse are examples of modern, if not contemporary, practitioners of significant periods of dark retreat sadhana.
Ayu Khandro performed the "Yang-Ti" (Tibetan), an advanced practice of the Dzogchen Upadesha, a version of the Dark Retreat.
Five wisdoms 
The Five Wisdoms are five kinds of wisdoms which appear when the mind is purified of the five disturbing emotions and the natural mind appears.
All of those five wisdoms are represented by one of the five buddha-families.
Meaning and translations.
"Pañca-jñāna" is rendered in English as: "five wisdoms," "five awarenesses," or "five pristine cognitions."
Interpretations.
The Five Wisdoms are: 
The Five Wisdoms "emerge through a transformation (parāvṛtti) of the eight consciousnesses at the moment of enlightenment".
Five Dhyani Buddhas.
The idea of the Five Wisdoms "underwent a considerable development" within Tibetan Buddhism where they are "symbolized or embodied" in the Five Dhyani Buddhas.
According to Bönpo teacher Tenzin Wangyal, the Five Pure Lights become the Five Poisons if we remain deluded, or the Five Wisdoms and the Five Buddha Families if we recognize their purity.
The Five Wisdoms, and the accompanying Five Buddhas, are represented in Tibetan Buddhism by the "symbolic bone ornaments".
The "Hevajra Tantra" associates the Symbolic Bone Ornaments directly with the Five Wisdoms: 
The additional ornament spoken of in various texts related to Hevajra is ash from a cremation ground smeared on the body (Tib.: thal chen).
Trance 
Trance is a state of semi-consciousness in which a person is not self-aware and is either altogether unresponsive to external stimuli (but nevertheless capable of pursuing and realizing an aim) or is selectively responsive in following the directions of the person (if any) who has induced the trance.
Trance states may occur involuntarily and unbidden.
The term "trance" may be associated with hypnosis, meditation, magic, flow, prayer, and altered states of consciousness.
Etymology.
Trance in its modern meaning comes from an earlier meaning of "a dazed, half-conscious or insensible condition or state of fear", via the Old French "transe" "fear of evil", from the Latin "transīre" "to cross", "pass over".
Working models.
Wier, in his 1995 book, "Trance: from magic to technology", defines a simple trance (p.
58) as a state of mind being caused by cognitive loops where a cognitive object (a thought, an image, a sound, an intentional action) repeats long enough to result in various sets of disabled cognitive functions.
Wier represents all trances (which include sleep and watching television) as taking place on a dissociated trance plane where at least some cognitive functions such as volition are disabled; as is seen in what is typically termed a 'hypnotic trance'.
With this definition, meditation, hypnosis, addictions and charisma are seen as being trance states.
In Wier's 2007 book, "The Way of Trance", he elaborates on these forms, adds ecstasy as an additional form and discusses the ethical implications of his model, including magic and government use which he terms "trance abuse".
John Horgan in "Rational Mysticism" (2003) explores the neurological mechanisms and psychological implications of trances and other mystical manifestations.
Horgan incorporates literature and case-studies from a number of disciplines in this work: chemistry, physics, psychology, radiology and theology.
Trance states.
Trance conditions include all the different states of mind, emotions, moods and daydreams that human beings experience.
All activities which engage a human involve the filtering of information coming into sense modalities, and this influences brain functioning and consciousness.
Therefore, trance may be understood as a way for the mind to change the way it filters information in order to provide more efficient use of the mind's resources.
Trance states may also be accessed or induced by various modalities and may be a way of accessing the unconscious mind for the purposes of relaxation, healing, intuition and inspiration.
There is an extensive documented history of trance as evidenced by the case-studies of anthropologists and ethnologists and associated and derivative disciplines.
Principles of trance are being explored and documented as are methods of trance induction.
Mind functioning during trance and benefits of trance states are being explored by medical and scientific inquiry.
Many traditions and rituals employ trance.
Trance also has a function in religion and mystical experience.
Castillo (1995) states that: "Trance phenomena result from the behavior of intense focusing of attention, which is the key psychological mechanism of trance induction.
Adaptive responses, including institutionalized forms of trance, are 'tuned' into neural networks in the brain and depend to a large extent on the characteristics of culture.
Culture-specific organizations exist in the structure of individual neurons and in the organizational formation of neural networks."
Hoffman (1998: p.
9) states that: "Trance is still conventionally defined as a state of reduced consciousness, or a somnolent state.
However, the more recent anthropological definition, linking it to 'altered states of consciousness' (Charles Tart), is becoming increasingly accepted."
Hoffman (1998, p.
9) asserts that: "...the trance state should be discussed in the plural, because there is more than one altered state of consciousness significantly different from everyday consciousness."
History.
Temple of Epidaurus: healing sleep.
According to Hoffman (1998: p. 10), pilgrims visited the Temple of Epidaurus, an asclepeion, in Greece for healing sleep.
Seekers of healing would make pilgrimage and be received by a priest who would welcome and bless them.
This temple housed an ancient religious ritual promoting dreams in the seeker that endeavored to promote healing and the solutions to problems, as did the oracles.
This temple was built in honor of Asclepios, the Greek god of medicine.
The Greek treatment was referred to as incubation, and focused on prayers to Asclepios for healing.
The asclepion at Epidaurus is both extensive and well-preserved, and is traditionally regarded as the birthplace of Asclepius.
(For a comparable modern tool see Dreamwork.)
Oracle at Delphi.
The Oracle at Delphi was also famous for trances in the ancient Greek world; priestesses there would make predictions about the future in exchange for gold.
Oral lore and storytelling.
Stories of the saints in the Middle Ages, myths, parables, fairy tales, oral lore and storytelling from different cultures are themselves potentially inducers of trance.
Often literary devices such as repetition are employed which is evident in many forms of trance induction.
Milton Erickson used stories to induce trance as do many NLP practitioners.
Military.
Joseph Jordania proposed the term "battle trance" in 2011 for a mental state when combatants do not feel fear and pain, and they lose their individual identity and acquire a collective identity.
The Norse Berserkers induced a trance-like state before battle, called "Berserkergang".
It is said to have given the warriors superhuman strength and made them impervious to pain during battle.
This form of trance could have been induced partly due to ingestion of hallucinogenic mushrooms.
Mystics.
As the mystical experience of mystics generally entails direct connection, communication and communion with the divine; trance and cognate experience are endemic. (see Yoga, Sufism, Shaman, Umbanda, Crazy Horse, etc.) 
As shown by Jonathan Garb, trance techniques also played a role in Lurianic Kabbalah, the mystical life of the circle of Moshe Hayyim Luzzatto and Hasidism.
Christian mystics.
Many Christian mystics are documented as having experiences that may be considered as cognate with trance, such as: Hildegard of Bingen, John of the Cross, Meister Eckhart, Saint Theresa (as seen in the Bernini sculpture) and Francis of Assisi.
Trance in American Christianity.
Taves (1999) charts the synonymic language of trance in the American Christian traditions: "power" or "presence" or "indwelling" of God, or Christ, or the Spirit, or spirits.
Typical expressions include "the indwelling of the Spirit" (Jonathan Edwards), "the witness of the Spirit" (John Wesley), "the power of God" (early American Methodists), being "filled with the Spirit of the Lord" (early Adventists; see charismatic Adventism), "communing with spirits" (Spiritualists), "the Christ within" (New Thought), "streams of holy fire and power" (Methodist holiness), "a religion of the Spirit and Power" (the Emmanuel Movement), and "the baptism of the Holy Spirit" (early Pentecostals).
(Taves, 1999: 3) 
Trance and Anglo-American Protestants.
Taves (1999) well-referenced book on trance charts the experience of Anglo-American Protestants and those who left the Protestant movement beginning with the transatlantic awakening in the early 18th century and ending with the rise of the psychology of religion and the birth of Pentecostalism in the early 20th century.
This book focuses on a class of seemingly involuntary acts alternately explained in religious and secular terminology.
These involuntary experiences include uncontrolled bodily movements (fits, bodily exercises, falling as dead, catalepsy, convulsions); spontaneous vocalizations (crying out, shouting, speaking in tongues); unusual sensory experiences (trances, visions, voices, clairvoyance, out-of-body experiences); and alterations of consciousness and/or memory (dreams, somnium, somnambulism, mesmeric trance, mediumistic trance, hypnosis, possession, alternating personality) (Taves, 1999: 3).
Trance induction and sensory modality.
Trance-like states are often interpreted as religious ecstasy or visions and can be deliberately induced using a variety of techniques, including prayer, religious rituals, meditation, pranayama (breathwork or breathing exercises), physical exercise, sexual intercourse, music, dancing, sweating (e.g. sweat lodge), fasting, thirsting, and the consumption of psychotropic drugs such as cannabis.
Sensory modality is the channel or conduit for the induction of the trance.
Sometimes an ecstatic experience takes place in occasion of contact with something or somebody perceived as extremely beautiful or holy.
It may also happen without any known reason.
The particular technique that an individual uses to induce ecstasy is usually one that is associated with that individual's particular religious and cultural traditions.
As a result, an ecstatic experience is usually interpreted within the context of a particular individual's religious and cultural traditions.
These interpretations often include statements about contact with supernatural or spiritual beings, about receiving new information as a revelation, also religion-related explanations of subsequent change of values, attitudes and behavior (e.g. in case of religious conversion).
Benevolent, neutral and malevolent trances may be induced (intentionally, spontaneously and/or accidentally) by different methods: 
Auditory driving and auditory art.
Charles Tart provides a useful working definition of auditory driving.
It is the induction of trance through the sense of hearing.
Auditory driving works through a process known as entrainment.
The usage of repetitive rhythms to induce trance states is an ancient phenomenon.
Throughout the world, shamanistic practitioners have been employing this method for millennia.
Anthropologists and other researchers have documented the similarity of shamanistic auditory driving rituals among different cultures.
Said simply, entrainment is the synchronization of different rhythmic cycles.
Breathing and heart rate have been shown to be affected by auditory stimulus, along with brainwave activity.
The ability of rhythmic sound to affect human brainwave activity, especially theta brainwaves, is the essence of auditory driving, and is the cause of the altered states of consciousness that it can induce.
Visual driving and visual art.
Nowack and Feltman published an article entitled "Eliciting the Photic Driving Response" which states that the EEG photic driving response is a sensitive neurophysiological measure which has been employed to assess chemical and drug effects, forms of epilepsy, neurological status of Alzheimer's patients, and physiological arousal.
Photic driving also impacts upon the psychological climate of a person by producing increased visual imagery and decreased physiological and subjective arousal.
In this research by Nowack and Feltman, all participants reported increased visual imagery during photic driving, as measured by their responses to an imagery questionnaire.
Dennis Wier states that over two millennia ago Ptolemy and Apuleius found that differing rates of flickering lights affected states of awareness and sometimes induced epilepsy.
Wier also asserts that it was discovered in the late 1920s that when light was shined on closed eyelids it resulted in an echoing production of brainwave frequencies.
Wier also opined that in 1965 Grey employed a stroboscope to project rhythmic light flashes into the eyes at a rate of 10–25 Hz (cycles per second).
Grey discovered that this stimulated similar brainwave activity.
Research by Thomas Budzynski, Oestrander et al., in the use of brain machines suggest that photic driving via the suprachiasmatic nucleus and direct electrical stimulation and driving via other mechanisms and modalities, may entrain processes of the brain facilitating rapid and enhanced learning, produce deep relaxation, euphoria, an increase in creativity, problem solving propensity and may be associated with enhanced concentration and accelerated learning.
The theta range and the border area between alpha and theta has generated considerable research interest.
Kinesthetic driving and somatic art.
Charles Tart provides a useful working definition of kinesthetic driving.
It is the induction of trance through the sense of touch, feeling or emotions.
Kinesthetic driving works through a process known as entrainment.
The rituals practiced by some athletes in preparing for contests are dismissed as superstition, but this is a device of sport psychologists to help them to attain an ecstasy-like state.
Joseph Campbell had a peak experience whilst running.
Roger Bannister on breaking the four-minute mile (Cameron, 1993: 185): "No longer conscious of my movement, I discovered a new unity with nature.
I had found a new source of power and beauty, a source I never dreamt existed."
Roger Bannister later became a distinguished neurologist.
Mechanisms and disciplines that include kinesthetic driving may include: dancing, walking meditation, yoga and asana, mudra, juggling, poi (juggling), etc. 
Sufism (the mystical branch of Islam) has theoretical and metaphoric texts regarding ecstasy as a state of connection with Allah.
Sufi practice rituals ("dhikr", "sema") use body movement and music to achieve the state.
Divination.
Divination is a cultural universal which anthropologists have observed as being present in many religions and cultures in all ages up to the present day (see sibyl).
Divination may be defined as a mechanism for fortune-telling by ascertaining information by interpretation of omens or an alleged supernatural agency.
Divination often entails ritual, and is often facilitated by trance.
Nechung Oracle.
In Tibet, oracles have played, and continue to play, an important part in religion and government.
The word "oracle" is used by Tibetans to refer to the spirit, deity or entity that enters those men and women who act as media between the natural and the spiritual realms.
The media are, therefore, known as "kuten", which literally means, "the physical basis".
The Dalai Lama, who lives in exile in northern India, still consults an oracle known as the "Nechung Oracle", which is considered the official state oracle of the government of Tibet.
He gives a complete description of the process of trance and possession in his book "Freedom in Exile".
Scientific disciplines.
Convergent disciplines of neuroanthropology, ethnomusicology, electroencephalography (EEG), neurotheology and cognitive neuroscience, amongst others, are conducting research into the trance induction of altered states of consciousness resulting from neuron entrainment with the driving of sensory modalities, for example polyharmonics, multiphonics, and percussive polyrhythms through the channel of the auditory and kinesthetic modality.
Neuroanthropology and cognitive neuroscience are conducting research into the trance induction of altered states of consciousness (possibly engendering higher consciousness) resulting from neuron firing entrainment with these polyharmonics and multiphonics.
Related research has been conducted into neural entraining with percussive polyrhythms.
The timbre of traditional singing bowls and their polyrhythms and multiphonics are considered meditative and calming, and the harmony inducing effects of this tool to potentially alter consciousness are being explored by scientists, medical professionals and therapists.
Brainwaves and brain rhythms.
Scientific advancement and new technologies such as computerized EEG, positron emission tomography, regional cerebral blood flow, and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, are providing measurable tools to assist in understanding trance phenomena.
There are four principal brainwave states that range from high-amplitude, low-frequency delta to low-amplitude, high-frequency beta.
These states range from deep dreamless sleep to a state of high arousal.
These four brainwave states are common throughout humans.
All levels of brainwaves exist in everyone at all times, even though one is foregrounded depending on the activity level.
When a person is in an aroused state and exhibiting a beta brainwave pattern, their brain also exhibits a component of alpha, theta and delta, even though only a trace may be present.
The University of Philadelphia study on some Christians at the Freedom Valley Worship Center in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, revealed that glossolalia-speaking (vocalizing or praying in unrecognizable form of language which is seen in members of certain Christian sects) activates areas of the brain out of voluntary control.
In addition, the frontal lobe of the brain, which monitors speech, significantly diminished in activity as the study participants spoke glossolalia.
Dr.
Andrew B. Newberg, in analysis of his earlier studies as opposed to the MRI scans of the test subjects, stated that Buddhist monks in meditation&lt; and Franciscan nuns in prayer exhibited increased activity in the frontal lobe, and subsequently their behaviors, very much under voluntary control.
The investigation found this particular beyond-body-control characteristic only in tongue-speakers (also see xenoglossia).
Studies have been conducted in France and Belgium on a French woman who has received extensive training in the Mongolian shamanic tradition and becomes therefore capable of self-inducing a trance state.
Quantitative EEG mapping and  low resolution electromagnetic tomography show that shamanic trance involves a shift from the normally dominant left analytical to the right experiential mode of self-experience, and from the normally dominant anterior prefrontal to the posterior somatosensory mode.
Holy Cross - Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality 
The Holy Cross - Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality (German: Heilig Kreuz - Zentrum für christliche Meditation und Spiritualität) is an institution of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Limburg, Germany.
It is based at the Holy Cross Church in Frankfurt-Bornheim and is dedicated to services, contemplation, meditation, retreats, counseling, and other events such as concerts.
History.
When Franz Kamphaus, then bishop of Limburg, visited the parishes of Frankfurt in 2004, he met people who were open to spiritual experiences but not within the traditional churches.
He founded the centre in 2007.
On 15 January he signed the charter of foundation for the theme church Holy Cross – Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality in Frankfurt-Bornheim.
The charter of foundation came into effect on 1 July 2007.
The Holy Cross Church accommodates one of five profile churches of the Diocese of Limburg.
The others are the Centre for Mourning Counselling in St. Michael in Frankfurt-Nordend and the three youth churches: Crossover in St. Hildegard in Limburg an der Lahn, Jona in St. Bonifatius in Frankfurt-Sachsenhausen, and Kana in Maria-Hilf in Wiesbaden-Nordost.
Like the church St. Michael, the Holy Cross Church is a branch church of the parish St. Josef Frankfurt.
The centre is a pastoral institution of the diocese and is subordinated to the head of department of the Episcopalian chair (Dr. Hildegard Wustmans).
The centre was directed from 2007 until July 2018 by the Franciscan Helmut Schlegel OFM, where he worked until June 2019 as a retreat and meditation leader and priestly co-worker.
Since November 2018 the centre is directed by the theologist Samuel Stricker guide.
In August 2019 Olaf Lindenberg took over the role as priestly co-worker.
They work with a team of contributors, for example from the order of Medical Mission Sisters.
In March 2020, the Center's program had to be suspended because all worship services in Germany and thus all other events had to be cancelled due to the COVID 19 pandemic in Germany.
However, at certain times the church is open for meditation for a limited number of people.
In May services were resumed on Saturdays under special conditions.
In December 2020, a Protestant vicar of the Protestant Church in Hesse and Nassau was employed for the first time in a six-month special vicariate in the center.
Program.
Although the offerings of the centre reflect the tenets of Christianity, the target audience includes people of all religious denominations, worldviews, and cultures.
The team currently publishes a new program annual.
The center offers different kinds of church services, such as expressionist dance, meditation courses, contemplative prayer, Zen-meditation courses, days of reflection, spiritual exercises, retreats, special events like for example lectures by guest speakers such as Anselm Grün, meditations with the Sōtō-Zen-priest and veteran of the Vietnam War Claude AnShin Thomas, external events like retreats on the North Sea island Wangerooge or sailing retreats and many other kinds of events.
The Meditation Center also participates in the virtual Ecumenical Church Congress (Ökumenischer Kirchentag) in May 2021 in Frankfurt am Main.
Since 2020, online offerings have supplemented the face-to-face events.
In addition, the church is open every day from 5 to 7 p.m. for free meditation.
Event series include or have included days of exercises of Christian mysticism, meditative singing, meditative archery, seminars concerning the bible a male conversation group, spiritual guided city tours in which topics by Frankfurt tourist guides are joined with spiritual topics or pilgrim hikes with a picnic and devotions.
One-time events are also part of the program, for example, the "Tram of Silence" tram rides on an historic railcar of the Frankfurt tramway system, including elements such as silence with short, thought-provoking impulses to the senses of seeing, hearing, feeling, and smelling.
The dialogue between the cultures and major religious groups concerning meditation and spirituality is another important aspect of the work of the centre.
These include panel discussions with representatives of Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity about meditation, with personal field reports from the different religions.
Other examples are or were courses in Qi Gong, Yoga and Yoga nidra, or dance performances of an Indian Jesuit padre who figures elements of traditional meditative dances such as Bharatanatyam from Hinduism as a kind of prayer to God.
For the last few years since 2011, a Cretan-style labyrinth consisting of 2,500 tealights has been formed on one of the Saturdays of Advent.
This labyrinth is part of the service and can be walked through by visitors.
In Advent 2020, four theme weeks were held with a special light show, the Advent Labyrinth, the Peace Light and about light figures.
During the Frankfurt festival of light in 2014 the team members of the centre offered a meditation consisting of light, words, music, and sound in cooperation with the Jona youth church in the Frankfurt Cathedral.
Concert performances at the center have included "A German Requiem" by Johannes Brahms and meditative music from the Middle Ages by Hildegard of Bingen, Peter Abelard, and Rabanus Maurus.
In 2021, a pilgrimage guide was published for a 5.5 km city pilgrimage route with 11 stops in Innenstadt (Frankfurt's city centre) and Altstadt (old town) from the Liebfrauenkirche (Church of Our Lady) via Hauptwache (Main Guard), Börse (Stock Exchange), Willy-Brandt-Platz, Paulskirche (St Paul's Church), Römer (Roman), Kaiserdom St Bartholomäus (St Bartholomew's Cathedral), Jüdischer Friedhof Börneplatz at the Battonnstraße (Old Jewish Cemetery at Battonnstraße) and Börneplatz (Börne Square), Alter Brücke (Old Bridge), Eiserner Steg (Iron Footbridge) to the Church of St Leonhard.
Interior.
The interior of the church was modified for the new purpose, completed in 2010.
The fixed pews were removed and replaced by folding chairs which enabled a more flexible use.
While the former main altar is normally not used, a smaller wooden altar has been added, typically surrounded by circles of folding chairs.
Stairlifts and ramps for wheelchairs were installed.
The former crypt and the rooms of the former clergy house were transformed to be used for meditation.
In the crypt, the floor was changed to wood, and the meditation area was enclosed by textile panels made from linen.
Church building and parish.
The Centre of Christian Meditation and Spirituality is located in the parish area of the Catholic parish St. Josef Frankfurt am Main, which was founded as a "parish of a new type" on 1 January 2015.
In the new greater parish area there are four churches located as "church places" and two churches as "theme churches".
One of the two theme churches is the Holy Cross Church, which headquarters the meditation centre and is used for church services and centre events.
The buildings are administrated by the Catholic Church of the city of Frankfurt am Main.
There is an active collaboration with the parish of St. Josef Frankfurt am Main.
Since the beginning of the restoration of the interior of St. Leonhard in Frankfurt-Altstadt, the services of the local "St. Leonhard's International English-Speaking Catholic Parish" have been held in the Holy Cross Church since 7 May 2011.
This remains the home of the Holy Cross Church even after the end of the work.
Transport connections.
The "Holy-Cross-Church" could easily be reached by walk in one minute from the tram stop "Ernst-May-Platz" of the tramline 14 of the Frankfurt tramway and the Stadtbahn station "Eissporthalle/Festplatz" of the line U7 of the Frankfurt light rail system (German: Frankfurt U-Bahn).
Bus line 38 connects the Panoramabad and the settlement with the district center and the neighboring district of Seckbach.
Also not far away is the motorway exit "Frankfurt-Ost" of the Federal Motorway 661 (German: Bundesautobahn 661).
Camino de Santiago.
Beneath the Bornheim slope to the east of the meditation centre runs a branch of the German Camino de Santiago (Way of St. James).
The route is based on the ancient trade route from Leipzig to Frankfurt am Main ("Des Reiches Straße").
The way starts in the bishop city Fulda and continues through Schlüchtern, Steinau an der Straße, Bad Soden-Salmünster, Gelnhausen, Langenselbold, Erlensee, and Bruchköbel.
It belongs to the network of main pilgrimage routes to the grave of St. James in the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela.
This branch, which is 116 km long, passes the Holy Cross Church and leads through the Ostpark, and then passes the Seat of the European Central Bank at the former Großmarkthalle (Wholesale Market Hall) on its route to the Main River and the inner city of Frankfurt am Main.
It also passes the Eiserner Steg (an iron footbridge) and continues to Mainz and Trier.
Taal (instrument) 
The taal, manjira (also spelled manjīrā or manjeera), jalra, karatala, kartal or gini is a pair of clash cymbals, originating in the Indian subcontinent, which make high-pitched percussion sounds.
In its simplest form, it consists of a pair of small hand cymbals.
The word taal comes from the Sanskrit word "Tālà", which literally means a clap.
It is a part of Indian music and culture, used in various traditional customs e.g. Bihu music, Harinaam etc.
It is a type of Ghana vadya.
In Hindu religious contexts it is known as karatalas (; "kara" "hand", "arm" and "tāla" "rhythm", "beat"), typically used to accompany devotional music such as bhajan and kirtan.
They are commonly used by Hare Krishna devotees when performing harinam, but are ubiquitous to all Hindu devotional music.
It is also called karatala or kartal (pronounced as “kartel”) in some contexts.
Types.
There are many types of Taal, categorised by size, weight and appearance.
Nepal.
The instrument is played in Nepal as well, known as the Jhyamta (Nepali: झ्याम्टा) (phonetic: Jhyāmṭā), a Nepali traditional musical instrument.
The Kirat community uses this with dhol (kirat)) in various cultural festivals such as Sakela, Chyabrung, Udhauli, Ubhauli and other social functions.
Tibet.
In Tibetan culture, the "tingsha" is a very similar instrument.
Uses.
Manjiras are commonly played in folk and devotional music.
They are played in various religious events and ceremonies in India and especially in bhajans.
Manjiras are ancient musical instruments.
Manjiras can be seen in many ancient temple pictures.
Marathi and Gujrati folk music.
Manjiras have a significant importance in Gujarati and Marathi folk music.
In Maharashtra they are known as Taal.
Initially Manjiras were played in aarti.
In Gujarat and Maharashtra, manjiras hold great importance and are played in bhajan, santvani and dayro.
Gymnosophy 
Gymnosophy (from Greek γυμνός "gymnós" "naked" and σοφία "sophía" "wisdom") was a movement and a philosophy practiced in Europe and the US from the end of the 19th century to the mid 20th century.
The practice involved nudity, asceticism, and meditation.
History.
In the early 20th century, the term was appropriated by several groups to denote a broad philosophy that included as a central thought that the nude human body is a natural condition and should be widely acceptable for the betterment of society.
This philosophy is related closely, and often interchangeably, with nudism and naturism, and has close connection to the hippie movement.
The movement is known by mainly three organisations: the English Gymnosophical Society, , and the American Gymnosophical Association.
In 1919, the Yoga teacher Blanche DeVries opened a "Yoga Gymnosophy Institute" in New York that combined Oriental Dance and Yoga.
The "English Gymnosophical Society" was founded in 1922 and became "The New Gymnosophy Society" in 1926.
One of the first members was Gerald Gardner, who in 1945 established the Five Acres Club, ostensibly as a nudist club, but as a front for Wiccans, as this was illegal in England until 1951.
The "Societe Internationale de Gymnosophie" was founded in 1926 in France.
Dr. Maurice Parmelee (1882-1969), professor of sociology at the City College of New York, wrote from 1923 to 1924 a book, "The New Gymnosophy", the title was changed to "Nudism In Modern Life" in later editions.
He took part in the founding of the "American Gymnosophical Association" 1930.
In 1932, Rochester Gymnosophy League was founded in Bushnell's Basin.
In 1933 the Dunedin Gymnosophy Club was founded in New Zealand.
The biochemist and historian Joseph Needham was known to practice gymnosophy.
In the last decade, the word gymnosophy has begun to be used as a term for a new, more spiritual and holistic, free body culture.
The word "gymnosophy" in literature.
A poem from the book "Non Serviam" (1945) by the Swedish author Gunnar Ekelöf is named "Gymnosofisten" ("The Gymnosophist").
In the novel "Don Quixote": "... in defiance and in spite of envy itself, and all the magicians that Persia, or Brahmans that India, or Gymnosophists that Ethiopia ever produced ..."
Sufi whirling 
Sufi whirling (or Sufi turning) ( borrowed from Persian Sama-zan, Sama, meaning "listening", from Arabic, and zan, meaning doer, from Persian) is a form of physically active meditation which originated among certain Sufi groups, and which is still practiced by the Sufi Dervishes of the Mevlevi order and other orders such as the Rifa'i-Marufi.
It is a customary meditation practice performed within the sema, or worship ceremony, through which dervishes (also called "semazens", from Persian ) aim to reach the source of all perfection, or dharma.
This is sought through abandoning one's nafs, ego or personal desires, by listening to the music, focusing on God, and spinning one's body in repetitive circles, which has been seen as a symbolic imitation of planets in the Solar System orbiting the sun.
The Mevlevi practice gave rise to an Egyptian form, "tanoura", distinguished by the use of a multicolored skirt.
This has also developed into a performance dance by non-Sufis, including dancers outside the Islamic world.
Origin.
As an order, the whirling Dervishes were founded by mystic poet Rumi in the 13th century.
Initially, Sufi fraternities ( "ṭarāʾiq") were organized as leaderships where members followed prescribed disciplines in service to a sheikh or master to establish trust with him.
A member of such a fraternity is referred to as a Persian "darwish".
These turuk were responsible for organizing an Islamic expression of religious life, often founded by independent saints or resulted from the division of existing orders.
Each Sufi tariqa stems from a unique "silsila", or "chain of order" in which a member must learn, as the "silsila" binds each member to Allah through one's chain of order.
One's "silsila" extends through the member's individual teacher, to their teacher and so on, through time until one is connected to the Prophet and thus Allah.
The Prophet himself is revered as the originator of Sufism, which has in turn been traced down through a series of saints.
Practice.
A dervish practices multiple rituals, the primary of which is the "dhikr", a remembering of Allah.
The "dhikr" involves recitation of devotional Islamic prayer.
This "dhikr" is coupled with physical exertions of movement, specifically dancing and whirling, in order to reach a state assumed by outsiders to be one of "ecstatic trances".
As explained by Sufis: 
In the symbolism of the Sema ritual, the semazen's camel's hair hat (sikke) represents the tombstone of the ego; his wide, white skirt ("tennure") represents the ego's shroud.
By removing his black cloak ("hırka"), he is spiritually reborn to the truth.
At the beginning of the Sema, by holding his arms crosswise, the semazen appears to represent the number one, thus testifying to god's unity.
While whirling, his arms are open: his right arm is directed to the sky, ready to receive god's beneficence; his left hand, upon which his eyes are fastened, is turned toward the earth.
The semazen conveys god's spiritual gift to those who are witnessing the Sema.
Revolving from right to left around the heart, the semazen embraces all humanity with love.
The human being has been created with love in order to love.
Mevlâna Jalâluddîn Rumi says, "All loves are a bridge to Divine love.
Yet, those who have not had a taste of it do not know!"
Among the Mevlevi order, the practice of "dhikr" is performed in a traditional dress: a "tennure", a sleeveless white frock, the "destegul", a long sleeved jacket, a belt, and a black overcoat or "khirqa" to be removed before the whirling begins.
As the ritual dance begins, the dervish dons a felt cap, a "sikke", in addition to a turban wrapped around the head, a trademark of the Mevlevi order.
The sheikh leads the ritual with strict regulations.
To begin, 
The sheikh stands in the most honored corner of the dancing place, and the dervishes pass by him three times, each time exchanging greetings, until the circling movement starts.
The rotation itself is on the left foot, the center of the rotation being the ball of the left foot and the whole surface of the foot staying in contact with the floor.
The impetus for the rotation is provided by the right foot, in a full 360-degree step.
If a dervish should become too enraptured, another Sufi, who is in charge of the orderly performance, will gently touch his frock in order to curb his movement, The dance of the dervishes is one of the most impressive features of the mystical life in Islam, and the music accompanying it is of exquisite beauty, beginning with the great hymn in honor of the Prophet (na't-i sharif, written by Jalaluddin himself) and ending with short, enthusiastic songs, some things sung in Turkish.
The Western world, having witnessed Sufi whirling through tourism, have described the various forms of "dhikr" as "barking, howling, dancing, etc."
The practice of each "tariqa" is unique to its individual order, specific traditions and customs may differ across countries.
The same "tariqa" in one country will not mirror that of another country as each order's ritual stresses "emotional religious life" in various forms.
The Mevleviyah order, like many others, practice the "dhikr" by performing a whirling meditation.
Accompanying the "dhikr" practices of whirling and prayer, the custom of "sama" serves to further one's "nourishment of the soul" through devotional "hearing" of the "'subtle' sounds of the hidden world or of the cosmos."
In contrast to the use of "sama", whirling and devotional prayer in the practice of "dhikr", the "tariqa" orders perform Sufi whirling in addition to playing musical instruments, consuming glowing embers, live scorpions and glass, puncturing body parts with needles and spikes, or practicing clairvoyance and levitation.
The dervish practice can be performed by community residents or lay members, members have typically been those of lower classes.
Within Islamic faith, unlike Middle Eastern law, women have equal status to men, allowing women to participate in "dhikr" as dervishes themselves.
Women were received into a "tariqa" order by a male sheikh, but traditionally were instructed to practice the "dhikr" alone or with an established branch of females within a specific order.
Sufi whirling, a worship of "dhikr", became a gender and class neutral practice throughout the Central Islamic region.
The custom of "sama" among Sufi orders has a history of controversy within the Islamic faith.
In one argument, the use of the term "sama" is considered to suggest physically "listening" in a spiritual context.
A differing opinion argues that "sama" is in fact "hearing", as "to hear" can pertain to any sound in addition to any "subtle" sounds of the spiritual realm.
Those in support of "sama" further claim that the term is actually synonymous with "understanding" and therefore recognition and application of the Revelation as well as the act of "attaining higher knowledge."
Sama can also refer to considerate listening to an honest temporal leader who ensures social justice and makes word of God mainstream.The spread of "sama" among Sufi orders began some time around the mid third/ninth century C.E. in Baghdad, eventually finding acceptance and favor in Persian, Turkish and Indian Islam.
The custom of "sama" evolved in practice over time as it complemented Sufi "dhkir", whirling and among some orders dancing and a meal.
Rules of propriety and conditions were adopted upon the widespread concern surrounding the necessity of "sama" with the "dhikr"; in order to distinguish between entertainment and valuable spiritual practice, the "sama" was distinguished as heard from the ego, heart or spirit.
Despite the application of rules, some sheikhs continued to limit or disapprove the practice of "sama".
While controversy continuously questioned the place of "sama" in Sufi orders, the music itself was not affected.
More recently, the custom of "sama" is most commonly performed within a "dhikr" ceremony.
Those in support of "sama" continue to argue that "according to that which it is not "sama" and dance which induce ecstasy, but ecstasy which arouses dance, or furthermore, that "sama" is only a revealing instrument and that it only supplies that which is brought to it by the hearer."
In 2005, UNESCO proclaimed the "Mevlevi Sema Ceremony" of Turkey as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.
Today.
Dervish communities, in the Middle Ages, served a central role in social, religious and political life throughout "central Islamic lands."
Dervish orders were at one time much larger in size than they are today, as the government has taken control over most Dervish monasteries throughout this area.
In 1925, Turkey ordered the dissolution of all Sufi fraternities by decree, the Mevlevi managed to survive among small villages throughout the Middle East.
In 1954, the Turkish government granted the Mevlevi order a special permission to perform ritual whirling practices for tourists during two weeks each year.
Outside of tourist entertainment, Orthodox theologians have now vocally discounted the Dervish practice resulting in "faqirs", or wandering, mendicant dervishes throughout central Islamic regions.
Despite strict government control over Dervish practices, the Mevleviyah order continued its existence in Turkey to this day.
While only men have historically been permitted to take part in the ceremony, some communities now allow women to participate.
Regional and secular forms.
Egyptian tanoura.
In Egypt, the practice of whirling has been adapted as tanoura ( "").
The word "tanoura" or "tannoura" refers to the colorful skirt worn by the whirler, with a color representing each Sufi order.
The word may also refer to the dancer, traditionally a Sufi man.
Tanoura is associated with Sufism and is performed at Sufi festivals, but it is also performed by non-Sufis as a folk dance or concert dance.
Although it is mainly used for visual effects, the dancers also augment their balance with the tanoura, through a dynamic centrifugal effect.
Pakistan.
In Sufi shrines in Pakistan, such as the Lal shrine in Sehwan, Sindh, the practice of Sufi whirling is called "Dhamaal" and is performed to honor Sufi saints, or qalandars.
Unlike the Turkish practice, Dhamaal may be practiced by any devotee – priests as well as pilgrims.
Dhamaal is usually preceded by the beating of a drum (naghara) and ringing of bells, as pilgrims raise their hands, start to skip steps standing at one place and gradually work into a trance as the beats get faster.
As the beats get faster, rhythms change and the drum beats are accompanies by the playing of shehnai.
Practitioners associate the dance with Lal Shahbaz Qalandar and with protests following the Battle of Karbala.
They regard the rhythm of the drum to evoke the rhythm of the creation of the universe, as illustrated in the concept of "Kun Fyakun".
In the West.
The tanoura tradition has attracted some interest from Westerners in the belly dancing community.
These performers include both men and women, solo and in groups.
Such performances may be augmented with pyrotechnics or props, such as veils, wings and ribbons.
The techniques used in Egyptian Tanoura can also be adopted by belly dancers to help with their balance and control dizziness.
Sufi whirling has also been promoted by actor and memoirist Annabelle Gurwitch as a form of stress relief.
Physiology.
A defining feature of whirling is continuous rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise) around a central radical axis while avoiding vertigo.
In untrained dancers, this sustained rotation causes dizziness or motion-induced vertigo.
Training for whirling targets the inner ear, which is responsible for balance functions in humans.
To counteract this effect, whirling dance performers practice various balancing and psychological techniques.
Records.
Guinness World Records for "most Sufi whirls in one hour" were awarded in London in 2012, to Shafik Ibrahim Abd El Hamed in the male category with 2,905 rotations, and Tara Lee Oakley in the female category with 2,191.
These records were surpassed in Zurich in 2015 by Nicole McLaren, with 3,552 rotations.
The longest continuous whirling performance has been recorded at more than four hours.
The most people simultaneously whirling is 755, set in Taiwan in 2011.
Neiye 
The c. 350 BCE Neiye 內業 or Inward Training is the oldest Chinese received text describing Daoist breath meditation techniques and "qi" circulation.
After the "Guanzi", a political and philosophical compendium, included the "Neiye" around the 2nd century BCE, it was seldom mentioned by Chinese scholars until the 20th century, when it was reevaluated as a "proto-Daoist" text that clearly influenced the "Daode jing", "Zhuangzi", and other classics.
"Neiye" traditions also influenced Chinese thought and culture.
For instance, it had the first references to cultivating the life forces "jing" "essence", "qi" "vital energy", and "shen" "spirit", which later became a fundamental concept in Daoist "Neidan" "internal alchemy", as well as the Three Treasures in traditional Chinese medicine.
Book.
The sinologist A. C. Graham regards the "Neiye" as "possibly the oldest 'mystical' text in China" (1989: 100).
The professor of religious studies Harold D. Roth describes it as "a manual on the theory and practice of meditation that contains the earliest references to breath control and the earliest discussion of the physiological basis of self-cultivation in the Chinese tradition" (1991: 611–2), and perhaps the oldest extant text of Daoism (1994: 37).
Title.
The title is a compound of two common Chinese words: "nèi" 内 meaning "inside; inner; internal" and "yè" 業 "work; deed; achievement; production".
In ancient Old Chinese that was used when the "Neiye" was compiled, the two titular component words had complex meanings.
Bernhard Karlgren's classic "Grammata Serica Recensa" dictionary translates "nèi" 內 as "enter; to bring in, to present; take to heart"; and says the early characters for "yè" 業 depicted a "horizontal board of a bell stand or frame", which was used as a phonetic loan character for "initiate; work; action; deed; profession; fortune, inheritance; strong; terrible" (1957: 695e, 640a) 
While many English-language authors transliterate the 內業 title as "Neiye" or "Nei-yeh", some translate it as: 
A. C. Graham's and Harold D. Roth's "Inward Training" is apparently the most common English title, owing to Roth's "Neiye" articles and translation (1991, 1994, 1996, 1997, and 1999).
Literary form.
The "Neiye" 內業 is a collection of poetic verses describing a method of guided breathing meditation and the underlying cosmology of the "Dao" on which it is based.
Roth calls the mystical method "inner cultivation", the goal of which is to directly apprehend this "all-pervading cosmic force" (1999: 11).
The text contains a total of 1,622 characters, and the verses are written almost exclusively in rhymed prose.
Most of the lines of verse are tetrasyllabic, that is, they contain four syllables each of which is represented by one character, but other patterns of five or more syllables sometimes occur.
The rhymes occur most often at the end of every second line (Roth 1999: 12).
Both the "Neiye"'s rhymed literary form and philosophical content are similar to the more renowned "Daode jing", which is about three times longer (Kirkland 2008: 771).
Take for example, Verse 2 (with rhyme words shown in Old Chinese reconstruction) discussing "jing" "vital energy": 
&lt;poem&gt; 
Therefore this vital energy is: 
Bright!—as if ascending the heavens [天 *"ten"]; 
Dark!—as if entering an abyss [淵 *"wen"]; 
Vast!—as if dwelling in an ocean [海 *"xməɣ"]; 
Lofty!—as if dwelling on a mountain peak [屺 *"kiəɣ"].
Therefore this vital energy 
Cannot be halted by force, [力 *"liək"] 
Yet can be secured by inner power [德 *"tək"].
Cannot be summoned by speech, 
Yet can be welcomed by the awareness [意 *"ˑiəɣ"].
Reverently hold onto it and do not lose it: 
This is called "developing inner power" [德 *"tək"].
When inner power develops and wisdom emerges, 
The myriad things will, to the last one, be grasped [得 *"tək"].
(tr. Roth 1999: 48–49) &lt;/poem&gt; 
Scholars infer two kinds of contextual evidence that the redactor of an initial written "Neiye" edition brought together a series of originally distinct verses: the variety of meter and rhyme in the lines, and the two usages of the conjunction "shìgù" 是故 “therefore" (Roth 1999: 14).
Riegel proposes that these poetic features of the "Neiye" would have facilitated memorization and recitation, suggesting that they might have been transmitted orally for a period of time before the compiler assembled and wrote them down. (1978: 148) 
Although extant editions of the "Neiye" text have only two or three general divisions, it is possible to identify distinct units based on semantic, syntactic, and phonological criteria.
Some different proposed textual separations are: fifteen separate verses with some subdivisions (Ma Feibai 馬非百, W. Allyn Rickett 1985–98); eighteen verses plus four subdivisions (Gustav Haloun and Jeffrey Riegel 1978); and twenty-six separate verses (Roth 1999: 14).
Dating.
The date when the "Neiye" was compiled is uncertain.
Rickett dated the text to the late 4th or early 3rd century BCE, Graham to the 4th, and Roth to the mid-4th (Kirkland 1997: 3); it is thus generally dated to around 350–300 BCE (Kirkland 2008: 771).
Campany rejects Roth's arguments for dating the "Neiye" to the 4th century BCE because they are based on his "speculative and wishful assumption" that political considerations were added only later to an "original Dao" (2005: 26).
The problem of the dating of the "Neiye" is connected to some other texts within the "Guanzi".
Four chapters ("piān" 篇) have descriptions of meditation practices: "Xinshu" 心術 "Techniques of the Mind I and II" (chapters 36 and 37), "Baixin" 白心 "The Purified Mind" (38), and "Neiye" 內業 "Inward Training" (49).
The "Guanzi" is a heterogenous collection of writings by diverse Legalist, Confucianist, and Daoist authors; compilation probably began around 300 BCE and material may have been added until 26 BCE when Liu Xiang edited the received text (Roth 1999: 18).
Since these four texts are the only "Guanzi" chapters to mention the significance of breath meditation, researchers tend to consider them together (Roth 1999: 18).
Furthermore, all four exhibit the irregular rhyme patterns thought to be characteristic of the Chu region variety of Chinese (Roth 1994: 11).
Many scholars have debated over the relationship between "Neiye", "Xinshu I and II", and "Baixin".
Most concur that these texts were written by Huang-Lao Daoist philosophers at the Jixia Academy in the Qi capital of Linzi, but many disagree over the dating of the texts and identity of the redactors.
After analyzing the structure and rhetorical characteristics of the "Daode jing", "Neiye", "Xinshu I", and "Baixin", The Chinese linguist William H. Baxter proposed that they constitute a specific literary genre, which emerged from "a distinctive tradition of philosophical verse with strong oral elements and little concept of individual authorship" (1998: 240–243, 249).
In order to estimate the dates of compilation for these "Guanzi" writings about breath circulation techniques, Roth analyzed the linguistic features of the "Neiye", "Xinshu I and II", and "Baixin"; and concluded that the "Neiye" is a genuine 4th-century BCE text while the others are derived from it (1999: 23–25).
The first three works have close conceptual and textual parallels, but the "Baixin"—which is a mostly prose essay on how a sage ruler can apply the meditation techniques to governing—is considered the latest work in the group.
Three types of evidence support the antiquity of the "Neiye".
First, its distinctive literary structure as a composition of originally independent, rhythmic and rhymed verse is a sign of oral transmission before literacy became widespread in the latter half of the 4th century BCE.
Second, the "Neiye" does not contain the kind of sustained argumentation typically found in 3rd-century BCE philosophical essays, and it shows only a loose principle of organization between its verses.
Third, the absence of the correlative cosmology of yin and yang and the Five Phases, characteristic of 3rd-century BCE texts.
Using redaction criticism – analyzing the production a text from how the redactors (editors, compilers) combined and arranged the source materials – Roth found that the "Xinshu II" is an original prose essay in which the redactor deliberately extracted and rearranged "Neiye" verses for the purpose of advocating the political benefits of inner cultivation methods (1994: 34).
It thus complements "Xinshu I" and accounts for the "Guanzi" labeling them as parts of one essay (1999: 26).
More specifically, Roth proposes that the "Neiye"'s exclusively verse format and absence of political thought would support a date of mid-4th century at the latest.
The first part of "Xinshu I" contains verses that are almost as old, but since they begin to advocate applying inner cultivation techniques to the task of governing and show evidence of interaction with rival intellectual positions, he dates them to about 300 BCE.
The commentary contained in the second part of "Xinshu I" shows the influence of the "Daodejing" and so must be dated to a later time after this work became influential in intellectual circles about 250 BCE (1999: 26–27).
A 45-character inscription on a Warring States era jade artifact may possibly be an earlier record of breath meditation than the "Neiye" (Harper 1999: 881).
This rhymed passage entitled "xingqi" 行氣 "circulating the vital breath" was inscribed on a dodecagonal block of jade, with nine trisyllabic phrases describing the stages of breath cultivation.
While the dating is uncertain, estimates range from earlier than 400 BCE (Joseph Needham), 380 BCE (Guo Moruo), to late 4th century BCE (Harper).
In any case, scholars agree that this is the earliest Chinese epigraphical evidence on the practice of breath meditation (Roth 1999: 162).
Basic concepts.
The ancient "Neiye" presents a "seamless web … connecting the psychological, physiological, and spiritual aspects of the human being" (Roth 1999: 106).
It is the earliest known text that explains self-cultivation through daily, practiced regulation of a group of life forces.
Namely, "qi" "vital energy" (the universal force that gives life to all things), "jing" "vital essence" (one's innate reservoir of "qi"), "xin" "heart-mind", "shen" "spirit; spiritual consciousness", "dao" "the Way", and "de" "inner power".
These terms later became keywords in Chinese philosophy, but the "Neiye" sometimes used them idiosyncratically, for instance, "dao" was effectively interchangeable with "shen" and "qi" (Kirkland 2008: 771).
Qi, which Roth translates as "vital energy" or "vital breath", integrates the physical with the psychological.
Kirkland describes "qi" "life-energy" in the "Neiye" as "a powerful salubrious reality" that is present everywhere and within all things (1997: 5).
According to the "Neiye", human beings are made up of systems containing various manifestations of "qi"; the "wǔzàng" 五臟 Five Orbs/Viscera system includes not only the physical organs (lungs, kidneys, liver, gallbladder, and spleen), but also the psychological range of mental and emotional states—presciently similar to the contemporary idea of neural correlates for consciousness (Roth 1999: 41–42).
Jing "vital essence" is a central concept in the "Neiye", with meanings that span from the universal life-giving essence contained in all creatures to the particular physiological substrate that allows sages to achieve profound tranquility.
Within each person, "qi" energy is centered in the "jing" essence, which Roth describes as "the source of the vital energy in human beings [and] the basis of our health, vitality, and psychological well-being" (1999: 42).
Verse 8 provides the following clear equation: "The vital essence ["jing" 精]: it is the essence [精] of the vital energy ["qi" 氣]."
Thus, it is concentrated and subtle form of vital energy (Roth 1999: 101).
The original meaning of "jing" (written 精 with the "rice radical" 米) "finest and purest rice" was a religious concept (Harper 1998: 119).
Pure and refined things were considered as the "stuff of spirits; quintessence; essence", referring either to sacrificial offerings suitable for the gods/spirits or the potency of the spirits themselves.
In later usage "jing" came to mean "germinal essence; energy that nourishes the human body; vitality".
Harper translates this term both as "essence" and "specter, spectral" in the "Neiye" (1998: 155).
The two most important philosophical concepts in the "Neiye" are the closely related notions of the vital essence and the Way.
The power of the Way to generate all things is manifested as the vital essence, which is the procreative principle within all phenomena (Roth 1999: 101).
The first lines of the text compare heavenly and earthly "jing".
&lt;poem&gt;The vital essence of all things: 
It is this that brings them to life.
It generates the five grains below 
And becomes the constellated stars above.
When flowing amid the heavens and earth, 
We call it ghostly and numinous.
When stored within the chests of human beings, 
We call them sages.
(Verse 1, tr. Roth 1999: 46) &lt;/poem&gt; 
By storing "jing" within the heart/mind, one can become sagely.
The sage's cultivation does not occur only at the spiritual level but rather sets into motion physiological changes, causing the human body to become thoroughly transformed and renewed (Yang 2003: 102).
Xin "heart; mind" is regularly translated by Roth as "mind" with a concrete connotation of not just the physical "heart" but also the entire sphere of vital energy that flows through it (1999: 42).
The "xin" is described as the ruling agency in an individual's "biospiritual nexus, i.e., in the entire personal complex of body/mind/heart/spirit" (Kirkland 1997: 6).
The "xin" can become agitated by excessive thought or emotion, which leads to dissipation of one's "jing" 精 "vital essence", and can result in sickness and death.
To preserve health and vitality, the "Neiye" says that "jing" 靜 "stabilizing; calming" the "xin" will draw in the external realities of "shen" and "dao" (Kirkland 2008: 771).
Shen is usually translated as English "spirit; spiritual", but in order to avoid the connotative ambiguities of "spirit", Roth uses "numen; numinous" in reference to a layer of mystical awareness that lies within the human body (1999: 43).
"Shen" comprises perception, cognition, and higher forms of awareness.
The original meaning of "shen" "god; spirit; deity" was also a religious concept.
External spirits were believed to occasionally descend to human beings (particularly shamans), or humans could draw them down with the power of "de" "inner power; virtue" (Harper 1998: 119).
Verse 13 describes the aspects of "shen" "numen; numinous": 
&lt;poem&gt;There is a numinous [mind] naturally residing within [有神自在身]; 
One moment it goes, the next it comes, 
And no one is able to conceive of it.
If you lose it you are inevitably disordered; 
If you attain it you are inevitably well ordered.
Diligently clean out its lodging place [敬除其舍] 
And its vital essence will naturally arrive [精將自來].
Still your attempts to imagine and conceive of it.
Relax your efforts to reflect on and control it.
Be reverent and diligent 
And its vital essence will naturally stabilize.
Grasp it and don't let go 
Then the eyes and ears won't overflow 
And the mind will have nothing else to seek.
When a properly aligned mind resides within you [正心在中], 
The myriad things will be seen in their proper perspective. (tr. Roth 1999: 70) &lt;/poem&gt; 
Verse 14 describes this "shen" "numinous [mind]" as a nondual awareness of the Way: "Within the mind there is yet another mind.
/ That mind within the mind: it is an awareness that precedes words."
(tr. Roth 1999: 72).
This statement means the mind can be divided into two levels: empirical and transcendent.
The former awaits transformation by the latter (Yang 2003: 104).
The "Neiye"'s privately practiced meditation, in which the "shen" settles into the practitioner's body, directly descends from the trance of the professional "wu" "shaman; spirit medium" (Graham 1989: 101).
Dao "the Way" is a well-known Chinese loanword in English meaning "an absolute entity which is the source of the universe" ("OED"), but the ancient "Neiye" sometimes used it as an equivalent of the "qi", "jing", and "shen" that a practitioner works to cultivate (Kirkland 1997: 7–9).
The "Neiye" describes the Way as a force that can enter or leave a person, and by engaging in specific self-cultivation practices one can make it come into direct experience or can keep it from going away (Roth 1999: 43).
&lt;poem&gt;Clear! as though right by your side.
Vague! as though it will not be attained.
Indiscernible! as though beyond the limitless.
The test of this is not far off: 
Daily we make use of its inner power ["de" 德].
The Way is what infuses the body, 
Yet people are unable to fix it in place.
It goes forth but does not return, 
It comes back but does not stay.
Silent! none can hear its sound.
Suddenly stopping! it abides within the mind.
Obscure! we do not see its form.
Surging forth! it arises with us.
We do not see its form, 
We do not hear its sound, 
Yet we can perceive an order to its accomplishments.
We call it "the Way."
(4, tr. Roth 1999: 52) &lt;/poem&gt; 
Thus, the term "dao" refers to a transient reality that a person needs to attract and to retain (Kirkland 1997: 13).
The "Neiye" warns that forceful efforts cannot make the "dao" arrive or stay, only one's "de" "inner power" (see below) can attract it and other life forces (Kirkland 2008: 772).
"Neiye" verse 4 above depicts the Way as the ineffable cosmic power familiar from other early Daoist texts like the "Daodejing", yet it has a much more tangible presence in the "Neiye" (Roth 1999: 102).
Verse 5 says the Way is a constantly moving power that seems to come and go within the human mind.
&lt;poem&gt;The Way has no fixed position; 
It abides within the excellent mind [善心].
When the mind is tranquil and the vital breath is regular [心靜氣理], 
The Way can thereby be halted.
That Way is not distant from us; 
When people attain it they are sustained 
That Way is not separated from us; 
When people accord with it they are harmonious.
Therefore: Concentrated! as though you could be roped together with it.
Indiscernible! as though beyond all locations.
The true state of that Way: 
How could it be conceived of and pronounced upon?
Cultivate your mind, make your thoughts tranquil [修心靜意], 
And the Way can thereby be attained. (tr. Roth 1999: 54) &lt;/poem&gt; 
Although constantly moving in and out of one's mind, the Way can stay within it when one cultivates tranquility through the regular and systematic practice of breathing meditation.
While the Way is always present, one is aware of this presence within the mind only when it is properly cultivated (Roth 1999: 103).
De "inner power" is a basic concept in traditional Daoism meaning "inherent character; inner moral power; virtue; integrity", but the "Neiye" used "de" to mean the "acquisitional agency" through which one can receive "qi", "jing", "shen", and "dao" (Kirkland 1997: 6).
Thus, "de" "inner power" (which is cognate with "de" 得 "get; acquire"), is something that we "acquire" when all elements of the body/heart/mind are peaceful and aligned.
Unlike other Daoist classics such as the "Daodejing" and "Zhuangzi" that describe "de" as intrinsic to everyone, the "Neiye" says one should practice daily self-control of thoughts and actions in order to build up one's "de" (Kirkland 1997: 7).
Inner power is a distinct quality of mental concentration that arises naturally, along with tranquility, through the practice of proper posture and breathing meditation (Roth 1999: 105).
&lt;poem&gt;When your body is not aligned [形不正], 
The inner power will not come.
When you are not tranquil within [中不靜], 
Your mind will not be well ordered.
Align your body, assist the inner power [正形攝德], 
Then it will gradually come on its own.
(Verse 11, tr. Roth 1999: 66) &lt;/poem&gt; 
This inner power can be thought of as a psychological condition of "focused and balanced awareness from which the adept is able to respond spontaneously and harmoniously to whatever arises" (Roth 1999: 126).
"Neiye" physiological concepts developed in the intellectual background of the 4th century BCE, a period when Chinese philosophers, notably the ethical egoist Yang Zhu, first considered the question of maintaining one's own physical wellbeing (Harper 1998: 120).
The chief innovation made in the "Neiye" is equating "jing" vital essence and "qi" vital breath/energy, which unites vital energy and essence with "shen" spirit/numen—thus naturalizing the old religious connotations of "jing" and "shen" into new physical meanings.
This inventive physiological theory merged a person's physical and spiritual components, and made vital breath/energy the source of each.
The "Neiye" opens with the statement that" jing" "vital essence" is the source of life.
Then the text identifies the mind as the "lodging place for the vital essence", defines vital essence as the "essence of vital breath/energy", and links "jing" with the indwelling "shen" "spirit".
"De" "inner power; virtue" serves as the mechanism by which the triad of vital energy, vital essence, and spirit are drawn to the body where they must be stored and concentrated in order to create a wellspring of vitality (Harper 1998: 119).
The "Neiye" introduced the physiological theory that one could transform oneself into a sage through heartmind training that cultivates "qi" vital breath/energy, "jing" vital essence, and "shen" spirit/numen in the body (Harper 1998: 78, 112).
From a modern perspective, these 2500-year-old "Neiye" concepts seem enigmatic; "qi" "vital breath" constitutes both matter and energy, while "xin" "body/heart/mind" or bodymind circumvents Cartesian dualism.
Owing to a semantic gap in the English lexicon, there is no standard word denoting the ancient Chinese "Neiye" worldview that spiritual life involves activities that also have physical components.
Suggested protologisms include "biospiritual" (Kirkland 1997), "physio-spiritual" (Harper 1998),"psychophysiological" (Roth 1991), and "psychospiritual" (Roth 1999).
According to the "Neiye", there is a set of elusive life forces that enter and leave the human body, but will only remain within a person who has transformed him/herself into an efficient receptacle.
For instance, "Cultivate your mind, make your thoughts tranquil, / And the Way can thereby be attained."
(Verse 5), and "Diligently clean out [spirit's] lodging place / And its vital essence will naturally arrive."
(13).
Kirkland says a good analogy for these forces might be radio waves that continually flow through us but can only be utilized by a device that is properly tuned.
Figuratively, we are all radios that were originally fully operational, but now are experiencing electromagnetic interference caused by excessive heart/mind activity, and we need to retune ourselves to eliminate the disturbance and begin functioning properly again (1997: 14).
Practices.
The "Neiye" acclaims a variety of practices and techniques for acquiring, or metaphorically "tuning in" to, the subtle forces of the Way.
Basic daily practices include proper alignment of one's body/heart/mind, breath meditation, and moderation in thinking and eating.
Practicing "zhèng" 正 '"alignment" of bodymind in order to attain "jìng" 靜 "tranquility" (cf. later "jingzuo" "tranquil sitting" meditation) is one of the most important aims in the "Neiye", where the word "zheng" "to rectify; to square up; to center; to align" appears in 9 of the 26 verses and "jing" "still; quiet; calm; tranquil" in 11.
"Fourfold Aligning" is the basic method of "Neiye" practice: "zhengxing" 正形 "aligning the body", "zhengsiti[zhi]" 正四體[肢] "aligning the four limbs", "zhengqi" 正氣 "aligning the vital energy", and "zhengxin" 正心 "aligning the mind" (Roth 1999: 109).
Since the human body is believed to be imbued with "qi" vital energy, the term "zhengxing" refers to aligning or harmonizing the flow of vital energy within the physical form ("xing" 形 literally means "form; shape"), while "zhengxin" refers to aligning the flow of vital energy within the mind (Roth 1991: 612).
"Aligning the body" and "aligning the four limbs" are closely related.
The former appears in Verse 11 (above): "When your body is not aligned [形不正], / The inner power will not come.
/ When you are not tranquil within [中不靜], / Your mind will not be well ordered.
/ "Align your body, assist the inner power [正形攝德], / Then it will gradually come on its own."
The latter alignment of arms and legs creates a figurative "she" 舍 "guest-house; lodging" for "jing" "vital essence" in Verse 8.
&lt;poem&gt;If you can be aligned and be tranquil [能正能靜], 
Only then can you be stable.
With a stable mind at your core [定心在中], 
With the eyes and ears acute and clear, 
And with the four limbs firm and fixed [四枝堅固], 
You can thereby make a lodging place for the vital essence [可以為精舍].
The vital essence: it is the essence of the vital energy.
When the vital energy is guided, it [the vital essence] is generated, 
But when it is generated, there is thought, 
When there is thought, there is knowledge, 
But when there is knowledge, then you must stop.
Whenever the forms of the mind have excessive knowledge, 
You lose your vitality. (tr. Roth 1999: 60)&lt;/poem&gt; 
In both these verses, being aligned precedes being tranquil, and thus developing a stabilized mind.
"Neiye" "alignment" apparently refers to sitting in a steady posture with the limbs aligned or squared up with one another, comparable to the vajrasana posture in Buddhist meditation (Roth 1999: 110).
This "Neiye" metaphor of "make a lodging place for the vital essence" refers to the primary mystical praxis, which Verse 13 (above) symbolically describes, "Diligently clean out its [the bodily "shen"'s] lodging place [敬除其舍] / And its vital essence will naturally arrive [精將自來]".
The method of "cleaning out ["chú" 除 "eliminate; remove; clean out"] the lodging place of the numinous" is essentially an apophatic process in which one "gradually and systematically removes the normal feelings, desires, thoughts, and perceptions that commonly occupy consciousness" (Roth 1999: 134).
"Xinshu I" repeats this "Neiye" metaphor: "The Tao is not far off, but it is hard to reach its limit.
It rests together with man, but it is hard to grasp.
Empty out your desires, and the numen will enter its abode.
If the abode is not thoroughly swept clean, the numen will not remain there."
(tr. Roth 1991: 623).
It also adds recommendations to "open its doors" (the senses), "relinquish selfishness", and "stop talking" in order to give the practitioner "shenming" 神明 "numinous clarity" (Roth 1991: 625).
Systematic breath meditation practices in the "Neiye" usually involve sitting in a stable position, circulating and refining the "qi" "vital breath", in order to produce concentrated "jing" "vital essence", which is thought of as the material counterpart of psychological tranquility.
Since vital essence is expended in everyday activities such perceiving, thinking, and feeling, one should minimize them.
Aligning the body and emptying the mind will maximize physical vitality and psychological well-being (Roth 1999: 126).
"Neiye" Verse 24 describes breath meditation practice in which the adept "shouyi" 守一 "maintains the One" and "yunqi" 運氣 "revolves the "qi"", which brings about a profound tranquility.
&lt;poem&gt;When you enlarge your mind and let go of it, 
When you relax your vital breath and expand it, 
When your body is calm and unmoving: 
And you can maintain the One and discard the myriad disturbances.
You will see profit and not be enticed by it, 
You will see harm and not be frightened by it.
Relaxed and unwound, yet acutely sensitive, 
In solitude you delight in your own person.
This is called "revolving the vital breath": 
Your thoughts and deeds seem heavenly. (24, tr. Roth 1999: 92) &lt;/poem&gt; 
Roth says this ancient reference to "shouyi", which later became a central tenet of Daoist and Chinese Buddhist meditation (Kohn 1989), describes a contemplative technique in which one sits calmly and exclusively concentrates on the Way, which enables one to set aside all the "disturbances of perceptions, thoughts, emotions, and desires that normally fill your conscious mind" (1999: 116).
Verse 17 provides specific details about regularized breath meditation.
Breathing is said to "coil and uncoil" ("zhōu" 周 "encircle; surround" and "kuān" 寬 "let go; release; stretch out; extend") or "contract and expand" ("mì" 密 "snug; condense; squeezed together" and "shū" 舒 "stretch; spread out; expand; unfold"), with coiling/contracting referring to exhalation and uncoiling/expanding to inhalation (Roth 1991: 619).
&lt;poem&gt;For all [to practice] this Way: 
You must coil, you must contract, 
You must uncoil, you must expand, 
You must be firm, you must be regular [in this practice].
Hold fast to this excellent [practice]; do not let go of it.
Chase away the excessive; abandon the trivial.
And when you reach its ultimate limit 
You will return to the Way and its inner power. (18, tr. Roth 1999: 78) &lt;/poem&gt; 
In addition to discussing mystical transformation through vital breath circulation, the "Neiye" recommends moderation in thought and diet so that the vital energy can flow freely and harmony can be achieved (Roth 1991: 619).
For instance, 
&lt;poem&gt;Deep thinking generates knowledge.
Idleness and carelessness generate worry.
Cruelty and arrogance generate resentment.
Worry and grief generate illness.
When illness reaches a distressing degree, you die.
When you think about something and don't let go of it, 
Internally you will be distressed, externally you will be weak.
Do not plan things out in advance 
Or else your vitality will cede its dwelling.
In eating, it is best not to fill up; 
In thinking, it is best not to overdo.
Limit these to the appropriate degree 
And you will naturally reach it [vitality]. (20, tr. Roth 1999: 84) &lt;/poem&gt; 
The "Neiye" also discusses common health concerns such as the "way of eating".
&lt;poem&gt;For all the Way of eating [食之道] is that: 
Overfilling yourself with food will impair your vital energy 
And cause your body to deteriorate.
Overrestricting your consumption causes the bones to wither 
And the blood to congeal.
The mean between overfilling and overrestricting: 
This is called "harmonious completion."
It is where the vital essence lodges 
And knowledge is generated. … (23, tr. Roth 1999: 90)&lt;/poem&gt; 
These holistic descriptions of harmonizing body, mind, and spirit are early references to the practice later called "yǎngshēng" 養生 "nourishing one's vital principle" (Roth 1999: 122).
Influences.
The c. 4th-century "Neiye" had long-reaching effects on Daoism and Chinese culture.
It influenced classic texts such as the "Daodejing" and "Zhuangzi", as well as what later became Daoist meditation, "Neidan" "internal alchemy", "Daoyin", and Daoist diet practices.
It also influenced theories about the Three Treasures ("jīng-qì-shén" 精氣神 "essence, vital energy, and spirit") in traditional Chinese medicine, and may have impacted the Confucian teachings of Mencius (c. 372-c. 289 BCE) about cultivating the "xin" "heartmind" (Kirkland 2008: 771).
Daoism.
The "Neiye" had a unique position in the history of Chinese philosophy.
Compared with other Hundred Schools of Thought texts from the Warring States period (475–221 BCE), the "Neiye" does not mention many basic philosophical theories such as yin and yang (Rickett 1985–98: 155).
The text is unconcerned with political philosophy; unlike the "Daodejing", which contains many passages discussing the problems involved with ruling a state (Kirkland 1997: 10).
Nor does the "Neiye" criticize Confucianism, as the "Daodejing" and "Zhuangzi" frequently do.
The Neiye contains no evidence that its authors or compilers were aware of the teachings from other current philosophical traditions, neither Confucianism, Mohism, Legalism, nor the School of Yin Yang (Kirkland 2008: 772).
Another distinctive feature of the "Neiye" is that it lacks the early Chinese idea of "Tian" "Heaven" as a beneficent agency overseeing and guiding life.
Both the Confucians and the Mohists shared ideas about "Tian" Heaven as the divine ruler and the "Tianzi" Son of Heaven as the earthly ruler (Kirkland 1997: 17).
The character "tian" 天 appears in a number of "Neiye" passages, in which Roth translates it in the naturalistic sense as "the heavens" (for instance, "Bright!—as if ascending the heavens", Verse 2 above) rather than the usual deified "heaven; Heaven" (1999: 43).
To illustrate the c. 4th-century BCE "Neiye"'s effects on early Daoism, examples are given below from the c. 3rd-century BCE "Daodejing" and the c. 3rd/2nd-century BCE "Zhuangzi".
The "Neiye" and "Daodejing" have parallels as well as differences.
Both texts contain teachings that originated in an oral tradition.
The "Neiye", like much of the "Daodejing", is primarily composed in rhymed verse, and some scholars believe that certain sections may have been borrowed from an early Daoist hymn (Rickett 1985–98: 154).
Harper suggests both texts were "canons of physical cultivation theory" meant for recitation by initiates who could have received fuller knowledge of its meaning either orally or in supplementary texts (1987: 561).
Both texts also share a conception of "Dao" "the Way" as the ultimate power through which everything generates and develops (Roth 1999: 145).
Compare how they describe the Way and the "wanwu" 萬物 "myriad things": "The myriad things are generated by it" and "The myriad things are completed by it" ("Neiye" verse 6) and "The Way gives birth to them, nourishes them, matures them, completes them, rests them, rears them, supports them, and protects them" ("Daodejing" chapter 51).
Both texts also similarly describe the concept of "de" "inner power".
In the "Neiye" (verses 4 and 2), "de" is the aspect of the Way that we "daily make use of" and which we develop through refining the "qi" vital breath into the "jing" vital essence through breath meditation.
The "Daodejing" (chapter 55) also links "de" and "jing" comparing one "who is filled with an abundance of inner power" with the newborn babe in whom the vital essence is maximized.
The "Neijing"'s emphasis on the importance of attaining "jing" tranquility through breath meditation is also found in the "Daodejing", where the term occurs in 7 of the 81 chapters, for instance, to "maintain tranquility is the central (practice)" (16, tr. Roth 1999: 147).
The most explicit "Daodejing" reference to practicing breath meditation contains three phrases with close parallels to the "Neiye".
&lt;poem&gt;Amid the daily activity of the psyche, can you embrace the One and not depart from it?
When concentrating your vital breath until it is at its softest, can you be like a child?
Can you sweep clean your Profound Mirror so you are able to have no flaws in it?
In loving the people and governing the state, can you do it without using knowledge?
When the Gates of Heaven open and close, can you become feminine?
In clarifying all within the Four Directions, can you do it without using knowledge? (chapter 10, tr. Roth 1999: 150; cf. Mair 1994: 69) &lt;/poem&gt; 
First, this "Daodejing" term "baoyi" 抱一 "embracing the One" parallels the "Neiye" "zhiyi" 執一 "hold fast to the One" (verse 9, tr. Roth 1999: 62), and both terms refer to retaining a sense of union with the Way in everyday life.
Second, "zhuanqi" 專氣 "concentrating the vital breath (until it is at its softest)" closely resembles "tuanqi" 摶氣 "concentrating your vital breath (as if numinous)" denoting to the practice of breath meditation (19, tr. Roth 1999: 82).
Third, "dichu xuanjian" 滌除玄覽 " sweep clean your Profound Mirror" and the distinctive "Neiye" metaphor "jingchu qi she" 敬除其舍 "diligently clean out its lodging place" (13, tr. Roth 1999: 70) share the same syntax and verb "chu" "eliminate; remove".
These three textual counterparts demonstrate that the redactors of both the "Neiye" and "Daodejing" shared knowledge of traditional proto-Daoist meditation techniques through which one could directly experience the Way and its inner power (Roth 1999: 152).
Notwithstanding these similarities and parallels, there are significant differences between the two texts.
As already mentioned, the "Neiye" contains virtually no political philosophy, which is a major focus in the "Daodejing".
There is no trace in the "Neiye" of many now-famous themes of the "Daodejing", such as "wu" "non-being", "ziran" "naturally; spontaneously", "wuwei" "non-interference", "pu" "uncarved; unhewn", "xian" "transcendent; immortal", and "xu" 虛 "emptiness" (Kirkland 2008: 772–773).
Unlike the "Daodejing" gender-based concepts of the Dao as mother, the Mysterious Female, and "feminine" behaviors such as humility or yielding, the "Neiye" has nothing to say about gender, which hints that women as well as men may have engaged in mediation practices (Kirkland 1997: 16).
In addition, the authors/compilers of the "Zhuangzi" were clearly familiar with "Neiye" inner cultivation practices.
The "Zhuangzi" text contains both weak and strong evidence of meditation techniques shared with the "Neiye".
Some passages contain similar terminology and others use sentences that are almost identical with those in the "Neiye" (Roth 1999: 153).
Here are two examples.
In the first passage, the character Wearcoat (被衣) instructs Gnaw Gap (齧缺) about the Way.
&lt;poem&gt;You must align your body [正汝形], 
Unify your vision, 
And the heavenly harmony will arrive.
Gather in your knowledge, 
Unify your attention, 
And the numinous will enter its lodging place [神將來舍], 
The inner power will beautify you, 
And the Way will reside in you.
You will see things with the eyes of a newborn calf 
And will not seek out their precedents. (22, tr. Roth 1999: 158; cf. Mair 1994: 213–214) &lt;/poem&gt; 
"Zhengxing" 正形 "aligning the body" is a basic "Neiye" practice, and "jing chu qi she" 敬除其舍 "cleaning out the lodging place of the numinous" resembles this "shen jianglai she" 神將來舍 "the numinous will enter its lodging place".
In the second "Zhuangzi" passage, Laozi instructs Nanrong Zhu (南榮趎) about meditation practices by paraphrasing, if not quoting, the "Neiye".
&lt;poem&gt;The practice for guarding vitality [衛生之經]: 
Can you embrace the One [能抱一乎]?
Can you not lose it [能勿失乎]?
Can you not resort to divining by tortoise or milfoil [能無卜筮]?
Yet know good and bad fortune [而知吉凶乎]?
Can you be still?
Can you cease [能止乎能已乎]?
Can you quit (seeking for) it in others [能舍諸人] 
And seek for within yourself [而求諸己乎]?
Can you be casual?
Can you be naive?
Can you be like a child?
The child howls all day but its throat does not become hoarse. (tr. Roth 1999: 159)&lt;/poem&gt; 
These "Zhuangzi" instructions are an almost verbatim repetition of "Neiye" Verse 19.
&lt;poem&gt;By concentrating your vital breath as if numinous, 
The myriad things will all be contained within you.
Can you concentrate?
Can you unite with them [能一乎]?
Can you not resort to divining by tortoise or milfoil [能無卜筮]?
Yet know bad and good fortune [而知吉凶乎]?
Can you stop?
Can you cease [能止乎能已乎]?
Can you not seek it in others [能勿求諸人]?, 
Yet attain it within yourself [而得之己乎]? … (tr. Roth 1999: 82)&lt;/poem&gt; 
Based upon the remarkable correspondences between these contexts, the authors of this "Zhuangzi" chapter were unquestionably familiar with the "Neiye" or a similar text (Roth 1999: 160).
The contents of the "Neiye" are distinct from either the "Daodejing" or the "Zhuangzi", despite the striking similarities among the texts.
Since the "Neiye" was written earlier than the "Daodejing", Kirkland proposes that it could be interpreted as an example of the earliest known Daoist teachings.
Since the compilers of the "Daodejing" were clearly interested in the same social and political issues that concerned members of other philosophical schools, one could reasonably characterize the teachings of the "Neiye" as "original Daoism," and the teachings of the "Daodejing" as "applied Daoism."
Although both texts apparently developed from the same general tradition, the "Neiye" compilers were primarily interested in self-cultivation practices, the "Daodejing" compilers were also interested in the broader issues of living in human society (Roth 1997: 18–19).
Mencius.
There is evidence that the "Neiye" also influenced the teachings of Mencius (c. 370-c. 290 BCE) on cultivating the "xin" heartmind and building up "qi", which later developed into Neo-Confucian ideals of self-cultivation (Kirkland 2008: 771).
In the "Mencius", Mencius tells his disciple Gongsun Chou 公孫丑, "At forty, I attained to an unperturbed mind ["budong xin" 不動心]" adding that attaining it is not difficult and another disciple Gaozi achieved it at a younger age.
Mencius also says, "I am good at nourishing my flood-like "ch'i" ["haoran zhi qi" 浩然之氣]".
When asked what that means, he explains, 
A hard thing to speak of.
It is the sort of "ch'i" which is utmost in vastness, utmost in firmness.
If by uprightness you nourish it and do not interfere with it, it stuffs the space between heaven and earth.
It is the sort of "ch'i" which matches the right with the Way; without these it starves.
It is generated by accumulation of rightdoing, it is not that by sporadic rightdoing one makes a grab at it.
If anything in conduct is dissatisfying to the heart it starves.
That is why I say that [Gaozi] has never understood the right, because he thinks it external.
There must be work for it, but do not adjust its course; do not let your heart forget it, but do not help it to grow. (2A.2, tr. Graham 1989: 127, cf. Legge 1875: 165)  
Mencius's description of a sage's "qi" vital energy as "haoran" 浩然 "flood-like" was likely taken from this "Neiye" passage: 
&lt;poem&gt;For those who preserve and naturally generate vital essence 
On the outside a calmness will flourish.
Stored inside, we take it to be the well spring.
Floodlike, it harmonizes and equalizes [浩然和平] 
And we take it to be the fount of the vital energy. (15, tr. Roth 1999: 74) &lt;/poem&gt; 
Graham dates the "Neiye" from the 4th century BCE, and says its practices may predate the hypothetical split between Confucianism and Daoism (1989: 100).
Another "Neiye"-"Mencius" textual parallel exists between "By concentrating your vital breath as if numinous, / The myriad things will all be contained within you [摶氣如神萬物備存]."
(19, tr. Roth 1999: 82, see "Zhuangzi" above) and "Mencius said, 'The myriad things are all here at my disposal in myself [萬物皆備於我矣].
There is no greater joy than to look back into oneself and find integrity'."
(7A/4, tr. Graham 1989: 127, cf. Legge 1875: 345) 
Both the "Neiye" and "Mencius" assume that one is born with an inherently perfect heartmind, and when one becomes confused that perfection is lost, but one can return to the original state of heart/mind by allowing an inherent harmony to replace the confusion.
Kirkland reasons that since these ideas seem more integral to the teachings of the "Neiye", it is logical to conclude that the ideas, if not the text itself, may have been known to Mencius or at least to his text's compilers (1997: 3, 11).
Excavated texts.
The c. 4th century BCE "Neiye" is connected with a corpus of 2nd century BCE medical and physical cultivation texts that archaeologists discovered in Western Han dynasty tombs.
The c. 168 BCE Mawangdui Silk Texts, excavated in 1973 near Changsha, Hunan, include several previously-unknown medical texts, such as the "Wushi'er Bingfang" "Recipes for Fifty-Two Ailments" and "Shiwen" 十問 "Ten Questions".
The c. 186 BCE Zhangjiashan Han bamboo texts, excavated in 1983 near Linyi, Hubei, include additional writings on medicine and health.
One of the most widely known Mawangdui silk texts is the "Daoyin tu" 導引圖 "Drawings of Guiding and Pulling" that illustrates 44 sitting and standing "daoyin" exercises.
The psychophysiological cultivation practices in the "Neiye" and the Mawangdui and Zhangjiashan texts have numerous parallels.
They share technical vocabulary for breath cultivation, particularly the three basic elements of human physiology: "qi" vital energy, "jing" vital essence, and "shen" spirit.
The texts also similarly describe circulating the vital energy in a stable, sitting posture with the spine erect (Roth 1999: 110, 168).
Furthermore, the "Neiye" and the Mawangdui Four Texts manuscript share a rhyme scheme associated with the state of Chu, and contain identical passages, thus indicating "an affinity that is too close to be a matter of chance" (Rickett 1993: 248–249).
However, the "Neiye" and the excavated texts give different purposes for practicing inner cultivation.
The Mawangdui and Zhangjiashan manuscripts are primarily concerned with goals of better health and longer life; although the "Neiye" occasionally mentions the physical benefits of breath cultivation, its goals are more psychological and spiritual (Roth 1999: 169).
For example, the Mawangdui text that most closely resembles the "Neiye" is the "Shiwen" Ten Questions.
While both mention "tuanqi" 摶氣 "concentrating your vital breath", it is done in order to attain the Way in the "Neiye" but to achieve longevity in the "Shiwen" (19, tr. Roth 1999: 82).
Both texts describe "jing" as being like a "quanyuan" 泉原 "wellspring", but in the "Neiye" vital essence is generated in order to attain tranquility (15, Roth 1999: 74), while in the "Shiwen" it is generated by "sucking in vital energy" and circulating it into the extremities (Roth 1999: 169).
Unlike the "Neiye" that discourses on philosophical and mystical concepts of human physiology, the Mawangdui and Zhangjiashan texts focus on teaching practical techniques for bodily care and long life.
Based on the "Neiye" text, Harper thinks that Warring States cultivation theory and practice was an esoteric tradition with few actual practitioners.
The Mawangdui and Zhangjiashan texts suggest that physical cultivation was popular in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE (1998: 126).
While the excavated texts do not mention how many people practiced the techniques and recipes, the literature was clearly available and represented a kind of "baseline macrobiotic hygiene for the elite" (Harper 1998: 114).
Beat (acoustics) 
In acoustics, a beat is an interference pattern between two sounds of slightly different frequencies, "perceived" as a periodic variation in volume whose rate is the difference of the two frequencies.
With tuning instruments that can produce sustained tones, beats can be readily recognized.
Tuning two tones to a unison will present a peculiar effect: when the two tones are close in pitch but not identical, the difference in frequency generates the beating.
The volume varies like in a tremolo as the sounds alternately interfere constructively and destructively.
As the two tones gradually approach unison, the beating slows down and may become so slow as to be imperceptible.
As the two tones get further apart, their beat frequency starts to approach the range of human pitch perception, the beating starts to sound like a note, and a combination tone is produced.
This combination tone can also be referred to as a missing fundamental, as the beat frequency of any two tones is equivalent to the frequency of their implied fundamental frequency.
Mathematics and physics of beat tones.
This phenomenon is best known in acoustics or music, though it can be found in any linear system: "According to the law of superposition, two tones sounding simultaneously are superimposed in a very simple way: one adds their amplitudes".
If a graph is drawn to show the function corresponding to the total sound of two strings, it can be seen that maxima and minima are no longer constant as when a pure note is played, but change over time: when the two waves are nearly 180 degrees out of phase the maxima of one wave cancel the minima of the other, whereas when they are nearly in phase their maxima sum up, raising the perceived volume.
It can be proven with the help of a sum-to-product trigonometric identity (see List of trigonometric identities) that the envelope of the maxima and minima form a wave whose frequency is half the difference between the frequencies of the two original waves.
Consider two sine waves of unit amplitude: 
If the two original frequencies are quite close (for example, a difference of approximately twelve hertz), the frequency of the cosine of the right side of the expression above, that is , is often too low to be perceived as an audible tone or pitch.
Instead, it is perceived as a periodic variation in the amplitude of the first term in the expression above.
It can be said that the lower frequency cosine term is an "envelope" for the higher frequency one, i.e. that its amplitude is modulated.
The frequency of the modulation is , that is, the average of the two frequencies.
It can be noted that every second burst in the modulation pattern is inverted.
Each peak is replaced by a trough and vice versa.
However, because the human ear is not sensitive to the phase of a sound, only its amplitude or intensity, only the magnitude of the envelope is heard.
Therefore, subjectively, the frequency of the envelope seems to have twice the frequency of the modulating cosine, which means the audible beat frequency is: 
This can be seen on the adjacent diagram.
A physical interpretation is that when 
the two waves are in phase and they interfere constructively.
When it is zero, they are out of phase and interfere destructively.
Beats occur also in more complex sounds, or in sounds of different volumes, though calculating them mathematically is not so easy.
For a human ear to hear beat phenomena, the ratio of frequencies should be less than formula_4 or else the brain perceives them as two different frequencies.
Beating can also be heard between notes that are near to, but not exactly, a harmonic interval, due to some harmonic of the first note beating with a harmonic of the second note.
For example, in the case of perfect fifth, the third harmonic (i.e. second overtone) of the bass note beats with the second harmonic (first overtone) of the other note.
As well as with out-of tune notes, this can also happen with some correctly tuned equal temperament intervals, because of the differences between them and the corresponding just intonation intervals: see Harmonic series (music)#Harmonics and tuning.
Binaural beats.
A binaural beat is an auditory illusion perceived when two different pure-tone sine waves, both with frequencies lower than 1500 Hz, with less than a 40 Hz difference between them, are presented to a listener dichotically (one through each ear).
For example, if a 530 Hz pure tone is presented to a subject's right ear, while a 520 Hz pure tone is presented to the subject's left ear, the listener will perceive the auditory illusion of a third tone, in addition to the two pure-tones presented to each ear.
The third sound is called a binaural beat, and in this example would have a perceived pitch correlating to a frequency of 10 Hz, that being the difference between the 530 Hz and 520 Hz pure tones presented to each ear.
Binaural-beat perception originates in the inferior colliculus of the midbrain and the superior olivary complex of the brainstem, where auditory signals from each ear are integrated and precipitate electrical impulses along neural pathways through the reticular formation up the midbrain to the thalamus, auditory cortex, and other cortical regions.
Some claimed benefits of binaural beats therapy may include: reduced stress, reduced anxiety, increased focus, increased concentration, increased motivation, increased confidence, and deeper meditation.
Research is inconclusive about the clinical benefits of binaural beat therapy; it has been argued that it is best not to replace traditional treatments for stress and anxiety with this type of intervention until conclusive evidence is presented.
There are no known side effects to listening to binaural beats, although lengthy exposure to sounds at or above 85 decibels can cause hearing loss over time.
This is roughly the level of noise produced by heavy traffic.
Uses.
Musicians commonly use interference beats objectively to check tuning at the unison, perfect fifth, or other simple harmonic intervals.
Piano and organ tuners even use a method involving counting beats, aiming at a particular number for a specific interval.
The composer Alvin Lucier has written many pieces that feature interference beats as their main focus.
Italian composer Giacinto Scelsi, whose style is grounded on microtonal oscillations of unisons, extensively explored the textural effects of interference beats, particularly in his late works such as the violin solos "Xnoybis" (1964) and "L'âme ailée / L'âme ouverte" (1973), which feature them prominently (Scelsi treated and notated each string of the instrument as a separate part, so that his violin solos are effectively quartets of one-strings, where different strings of the violin may be simultaneously playing the same note with microtonal shifts, so that the interference patterns are generated).
Composer Phill Niblock's music is entirely based on beating caused by microtonal differences.
Computer engineer Toso Pankovski invented a method based on auditory interference beating to screen participants in online auditory studies for headphones and dichotic context (whether the stereo channels are mixed or completely separated).
Meditation and pain 
Meditation and pain is the study of the physiological mechanisms underlying meditation-specifically its neural components- that implicate it in the reduction of pain perception.
Meditation is a behavioral method that has been used for several thousand years to monitor and regulate emotion and attention.
Broadly speaking, meditation can be categorized into one of four modes (formal practices): focused attention, open monitoring, and compassion or love-kindness practices.
In addition, there are sub-variations of each of the aforementioned practices that exist, such as prayer and zen.
Pain is defined as an unpleasant sensory or emotional experience that points to possible or actual tissue damage.
The mechanisms underlying pain have been studied in order to develop methods to alleviate chronic pain.
Research on meditation has shown that it involves specific brain regions that reduce overall pain perception.
Neural mechanisms.
Several studies using meditation experts as subjects have shown that meditative practices impact several regions of the brain.
Studies using functional and structural MRI studies have shown increased activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of individuals engaging in mindfulness meditation.
Additionally, functional changes in the pre-frontal cortex (PFC) as well as activity in nociceptive processing have been observed in neuroimaging studies on meditation.
Meta-analysis research using fMRI on the various modes of meditation has shown activation in the pre-motor cortex, basal ganglia, and insular cortex- regions associated with the reward pathways of the brain as well as motor control.
Activation of the precentral gyrus, midbrain, inferior parietal lobule, precuneus, and hippocampus have also been correlated with meditation using PET scans and single photon emission computed tomography.
Moreover, in a study using experienced meditators, the findings showed increased cortical thickness in the PFC. 
Increased activation in the PFC has been correlated with chronic pain.
In a study comparing the MRI scans of chronic lower back pain patients before and after treatment to their healthy counterparts, patients with chronic pain exhibited thinner PFCs than the control.
After treatment, chronic lower back patients showed increased thickness in the PFC which decreased pain perception and physical disability.
Additional brain regions are involved in pain perception in what is referred to as the 'pain matrix'.
The pain matrix includes the primary somatosensory cortex (SI), insula, ACC, and thalamus.
Reduction of pain perception via mediation is mediated by the interconnected brain pathways between pain perception and meditation.
These intersections are what contribute to the reduction in perceived pain via mediation.
In a study using MEG and fMRI on a yoga master, researchers found that MEG recordings showed higher peaks of alpha waves in meditators as opposed to non-meditators in the parietal, occipital, and temporal regions; and fMRI images showed changes in the thalamus and SI regions.
The resulting findings showed a reduction in pain perception, which is consistent in studies where researchers found deactivation of the thalamus in experienced meditators.
A study recorded the response of thermal pain stimuli in experienced and novice meditators.
Researchers found that long term meditators showed lower responses in the PFC and ACC, and that after 5 months of training, the control also experienced decreased responses in those same areas.
As a result, reduction in pain perception is attributed to a decrease in brain regions involving the pain network.
A study using event-related potentials (ERP) showed that the meditation group exhibited decreased activation in the SI and posterior insula compared to a healthy control, which led to a reduction in pain perception.
This is mediated by the fact that pain is a result of activation of the insula and SI, so a deactivation of these regions as a result of meditation reduces pain perception.
Mandala 
A mandala (, ) is a geometric configuration of symbols.
In various spiritual traditions, mandalas may be employed for focusing attention of practitioners and adepts, as a spiritual guidance tool, for establishing a sacred space and as an aid to meditation and trance induction.
In the Eastern religions of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Shinto it is used as a map representing deities, or especially in the case of Shinto, paradises, kami or actual shrines.
A mandala generally represents the spiritual journey, starting from outside to the inner core, through layers.
Hinduism.
In Hinduism, a basic mandala, also called a "yantra", takes the form of a square with four gates containing a circle with a center point.
Each gate is in the general shape of a T. Mandalas often have radial balance.
A "yantra" is similar to a mandala, usually smaller and using a more limited colour palette.
It may be a two- or three-dimensional geometric composition used in "sadhanas", puja or meditative rituals, and may incorporate a mantra into its design.
It is considered to represent the abode of the deity.
Each "yantra" is unique and calls the deity into the presence of the practitioner through the elaborate symbolic geometric designs.
According to one scholar, "Yantras function as revelatory symbols of cosmic truths and as instructional charts of the spiritual aspect of human experience" 
Many situate "yantras" as central focus points for Hindu tantric practice.
"Yantras" are not representations, but are lived, experiential, nondual realities.
As Khanna describes: 
The term 'mandala' appears in the Rigveda as the name of the sections of the work, and Vedic rituals use mandalas such as the Navagraha mandala to this day.
Buddhism.
Vajrayana.
In Vajrayana Buddhism, mandalas have been developed also into sandpainting.
They are also a key part of Anuttarayoga Tantra meditation practices.
Visualisation of Vajrayana teachings.
The man mandala can be shown to represent in visual form the core essence of the Vajrayana teachings.
The mandala represents the nature of the Pure Land, Enlightened mind.
An example of this type of mandala is "Vajrabhairava mandala" a silk tapestry woven with gilded paper depicting lavish elements like crowns and jewelry, which gives a three-dimensional effect to the piece.
Mount Meru.
A mandala can also represent the entire universe, which is traditionally depicted with Mount Meru as the axis mundi in the center, surrounded by the continents.
One example is the "Cosmological Mandala with Mount Meru", a silk tapestry from the Yuan dynasty that serves as a diagram of the Tibetan cosmology, which was given to China from Nepal and Tibet.
Wisdom and impermanence.
In the mandala, the outer circle of fire usually symbolises wisdom.
The ring of eight charnel grounds represents the Buddhist exhortation to be always mindful of death, and the impermanence with which "samsara" is suffused: "such locations were utilized in order to confront and to realize the transient nature of life".
Described elsewhere: "within a flaming rainbow nimbus and encircled by a black ring of dorjes, the major outer ring depicts the eight great charnel grounds, to emphasize the dangerous nature of human life".
Inside these rings lie the walls of the mandala palace itself, specifically a place populated by deities and Buddhas.
Five Buddhas.
One well-known type of mandala is the mandala of the "Five Buddhas", archetypal Buddha forms embodying various aspects of enlightenment.
Such Buddhas are depicted depending on the school of Buddhism, and even the specific purpose of the mandala.
A common mandala of this type is that of the Five Wisdom Buddhas (a.k.a. Five "Jinas"), the Buddhas Vairocana, Aksobhya, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha and Amoghasiddhi.
When paired with another mandala depicting the Five Wisdom Kings, this forms the Mandala of the Two Realms.
Practice.
Mandalas are commonly used by tantric Buddhists as an aid to meditation.
The mandala is "a support for the meditating person", something to be repeatedly contemplated to the point of saturation, such that the image of the mandala becomes fully internalised in even the minutest detail and can then be summoned and contemplated at will as a clear and vivid visualized image.
With every mandala comes what Tucci calls "its associated liturgy ... contained in texts known as tantras", instructing practitioners on how the mandala should be drawn, built and visualised, and indicating the mantras to be recited during its ritual use.
By visualizing "pure lands", one learns to understand experience "itself" as pure, and as the abode of enlightenment.
The protection that we need, in this view, is from our own minds, as much as from external sources of confusion.
In many tantric mandalas, this aspect of separation and protection from the outer samsaric world is depicted by "the four outer circles: the purifying fire of wisdom, the vajra circle, the circle with the eight tombs, the lotus circle".
The ring of "vajras" forms a connected fence-like arrangement running around the perimeter of the outer mandala circle.
As a meditation on impermanence (a central teaching of Buddhism), after days or weeks of creating the intricate pattern of a sand mandala, the sand is brushed together into a pile and spilled into a body of running water to spread the blessings of the mandala.
Kværne in his extended discussion of sahaja, discusses the relationship of sadhana interiority and exteriority in relation to mandala thus: 
Offerings.
A "mandala offering" in Tibetan Buddhism is a symbolic offering of the entire universe.
Every intricate detail of these mandalas is fixed in the tradition and has specific symbolic meanings, often on more than one level.
Whereas the above mandala represents the pure surroundings of a Buddha, this mandala represents the universe.
This type of mandala is used for the mandala-offerings, during which one symbolically offers the universe to the Buddhas or to one's teacher.
Within Vajrayana practice, 100,000 of these mandala offerings (to create merit) can be part of the preliminary practices before a student even begins actual tantric practices.
This mandala is generally structured according to the model of the universe as taught in a Buddhist classic text the "Abhidharma-kośa", with Mount Meru at the centre, surrounded by the continents, oceans and mountains, etc. 
Theravada Buddhism.
Various Mandalas are described in many Pali Buddhist texts.
Some of the examples of the Theravada Buddhist Mandalas are: 
In Sigālovāda Sutta, Buddha describes the relationships of a common lay persons in Mandala style.
Shingon Buddhism.
One Japanese branch of Mahayana Buddhism – Shingon Buddhism – makes frequent use of mandalas in its rituals as well, though the actual mandalas differ.
When Shingon's founder, Kukai, returned from his training in China, he brought back two mandalas that became central to Shingon ritual: the Mandala of the Womb Realm and the Mandala of the Diamond Realm.
These two mandalas are engaged in the "abhiseka" initiation rituals for new Shingon students, more commonly known as the ().
A common feature of this ritual is to blindfold the new initiate and to have them throw a flower upon either mandala.
Where the flower lands assists in the determination of which tutelary deity the initiate should follow.
Sand mandalas, as found in Tibetan Buddhism, are not practiced in Shingon Buddhism.
Nichiren Buddhism.
The mandala in Nichiren Buddhism is a (), which is a paper hanging scroll or wooden tablet whose inscription consists of Chinese characters and medieval-Sanskrit script representing elements of the Buddha's enlightenment, protective Buddhist deities, and certain Buddhist concepts.
Called the "Gohonzon", it was originally inscribed by Nichiren, the founder of this branch of Japanese Buddhism, during the late 13th Century.
The "Gohonzon" is the primary object of veneration in some Nichiren schools and the only one in others, which consider it to be the supreme object of worship as the embodiment of the supreme Dharma and Nichiren's inner enlightenment.
The seven characters Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō, considered to be the name of the supreme Dharma, as well as the invocation that believers chant, are written down the center of all Nichiren-sect "Gohonzons", whose appearance may otherwise vary depending on the particular school and other factors.
Pure Land Buddhism.
Mandalas have sometimes been used in Pure Land Buddhism to graphically represent Pure Lands, based on descriptions found in the "Larger Sutra" and the "Contemplation Sutra".
The most famous mandala in Japan is the Taima mandala, dated to about 763 CE.
The Taima mandala is based on the "Contemplation Sutra", but other similar mandalas have been made subsequently.
Unlike mandalas used in Vajrayana Buddhism, it is not used as an object of meditation or for esoteric ritual.
Instead, it provides a visual representation of the Pure Land texts, and is used as a teaching aid.
Also in Jodo Shinshu Buddhism, Shinran and his descendant, Rennyo, sought a way to create easily accessible objects of reverence for the lower-classes of Japanese society.
Shinran designed a mandala using a hanging scroll, and the words of the "nembutsu" () written vertically.
This style of mandala is still used by some Jodo Shinshu Buddhists in home altars, or "butsudan".
Bodhimandala.
Bodhimaṇḍala is a term in Buddhism that means "circle of awakening".
Sand mandalas.
Sand mandalas are colorful mandalas made from sand that are ritualistically destroyed.
They originated in India in the 8th-12th century but are now practiced in Tibetan Buddhism.
Each mandala is dedicated to specific deities.
In Buddhism Deities represent states of the mind to be obtained on the path to enlightenment, the mandala itself is representative of the deities palace which also represents the mind of the deity.
Each mandala is a pictorial representation of a tantra. for the process of making Sand mandalas they are created by monks that have trained for 3-5 years in a monastery.
These sand mandalas are made to be destroyed to symbolize impermanence, the Buddhist belief that death is not the end, and that one's essence will always return to the elements.
It is also related to the belief that one should not become attached to anything.
To create these mandalas, the monks first create a sketch, then take colorful sand traditionally made from powdered stones and gems into copper funnels called Cornetts and gently tap sand out of them to create the sand mandala.
Each color represents attributes of deities.
While making the mandalas the monks will pray and meditate, each grain of sand represents a blessing.
Monks will travel to demonstrate this art form to people, often in museums.
Mesoamerican civilizations.
Mayan "Tzolk'in".
The Maya civilization tended to present calendars in a form similar to a mandala.
It is similar in form and function to the "Kalachakra" (Wheel of Time) sand paintings of Tibetan Buddhists.
Maya symbolism was later used in the Dreamspell calendar, developed by José Argüelles.
Sometimes described as an authentic Mayan mandala, it is "inspired by" elements of the 260-day Tzolk'in calendar (as opposed to the 365-day Haabʼ calendar).
Aztec Sun Stone.
The Sun Stone is thought to be a ceremonial representation of the entire universe as seen by the Aztec religious class, in some ways resembling a mandala.
The earliest interpretations of the stone relate to its use as a calendar.
In 1792, two years after the stone's unearthing, Mexican anthropologist Antonio de León y Gama wrote a treatise on the Aztec calendar using the stone as its basis.
Some of the circles of glyphs are the glyphs for the days of the month.
The four symbols included in the Ollin glyph represent the four past suns that the Mexica believed the earth had passed through.
Another aspect of the stone is its religious significance.
One theory is that the face at the center of the stone represents Tonatiuh, the Aztec deity of the sun; it is for this reason that the stone became known as the "Sun Stone."
Richard Townsend proposed a different theory, claiming that the figure at the center of the stone represents Tlaltecuhtli, the Mexica earth deity who features in Mexica creation myths.
Modern archaeologists, such as those at the National Anthropology Museum in Mexico City, believe it is more likely to have been used primarily as a ceremonial basin or ritual altar for gladiatorial sacrifices than as an astrological or astronomical reference.
Yet another characteristic of the stone is its possible geographic significance.
The four points may relate to the four corners of the earth or the cardinal points.
The inner circles may express space as well as time.
Lastly, there is the political aspect of the stone.
It may have been intended to show Tenochtitlan as the center of the world and therefore, as the center of authority.
Townsend argues in favor of this idea, claiming that the small glyphs of additional dates amongst the four previous suns - 1 Flint ("Tecpatl"), 1 Rain ("Atl"), and 7 Monkey ("Ozomahtli") – represent matters of historical importance to the Mexica state.
He posits, for example, that 7 Monkey represents the significant day for the cult of a community within "Tenochtitlan".
His claim is further supported by the presence of Mexica ruler Moctezuma II's name on the work.
Christianity.
The Cosmati pavements, including that at Westminster Abbey, are geometric supposedly mandala-like mosaic designs from thirteenth century Italy.
The Great Pavement at Westminster Abbey is believed to embody divine and cosmic geometries as the seat of enthronement of the monarchs of England.
Similarly, many of the Illuminations of Hildegard von Bingen can be used as mandalas, as well as many of the images of esoteric Christianity, as in Christian Hermeticism, Christian Alchemy, and Rosicrucianism.
Alchemist, mathematician and astrologer John Dee developed a geometric symbol which he called the "Sigillum Dei" (Seal of God) manifesting a universal geometric order which incorporated the names of the archangels, derived from earlier forms of the "clavicula salomonis" or key of Solomon.
The Layer Monument, an early 17th-century marble mural funerary monument at the Church of Saint John the Baptist, Maddermarket, Norwich, is a rare example of Christian iconography absorbing alchemical symbolism to create a mandala in Western funerary art.
Western psychological interpretations.
The re-introduction of mandalas into modern Western thought is largely credited to psychologist Carl Gustav Jung.
In his exploration of the unconscious through art, Jung observed the common appearance of a circle motif across religions and cultures.
He hypothesized that the circle drawings reflected the mind's inner state at the moment of creation and were a kind of symbolic archetype in the universal subconscious.
Familiarity with the philosophical writings of India prompted Jung to adopt the word "mandala" to describe these drawings created by himself and his patients.
In his autobiography, Jung wrote: 
Jung claimed that the urge to make mandalas emerges during moments of intense personal growth.
He further hypothesized their appearance indicated a "profound re-balancing process" is underway in the psyche; the result of the process would be a more complex and better integrated personality.
American art therapist Joan Kellogg later created the MARI card test, a free response measure, based on Jung's work.
Transpersonal psychologist David Fontana proposed that the symbolic nature of a mandala may help one "to access progressively deeper levels of the unconscious, ultimately assisting the meditator to experience a mystical sense of oneness with the ultimate unity from which the cosmos in all its manifold forms arises."
In architecture.
Buddhist architecture often applied mandala as the blueprint or plan to design Buddhist structures, including temple complex and stupas.
A notable example of mandala in architecture is the 9th century Borobudur in Central Java, Indonesia.
It is built as a large stupa surrounded by smaller ones arranged on terraces formed as a stepped pyramid, and when viewed from above, takes the form of a giant tantric Buddhist mandala, simultaneously representing the Buddhist cosmology and the nature of mind.
Other temples from the same period that also have mandala plans include Sewu, Plaosan and Prambanan.
Similar mandala designs are also observable in Cambodia, Thailand and Myanmar.
In science.
Circular diagrams are often used in phylogenetics, especially for the graphical representation of phylogenetic relationships.
Evolutionary trees often encompass numerous species that are conveniently shown on a circular tree, with images of the species shown on the periphery of a tree.
Such diagrams have been called phylogenetic mandalas.
In art.
Mandala as an art form first appeared in Buddhist art that were produced in India during the first century B.C.E.
These can also be seen in Rangoli designs in Indian households.
In New Age, the mandala is a diagram, chart or geometric pattern that represents the cosmos metaphysically or symbolically; a time-microcosm of the universe, but it originally meant to represent wholeness and a model for the organizational structure of life itself, a cosmic diagram that shows the relation to the infinite and the world that extends beyond and within various minds &amp; bodies.
In archaeology.
One of the most intense archaeological discoveries in recent years that could redefine the history of eastern thought and tradition of mandala is the discovery of five giant mandalas in the valley of Manipur, India, made with Google Earth imagery.
Located in the paddy field in the west of Imphal, the capital of Manipur, the Maklang geoglyph is perhaps the world's largest mandala built entirely of mud.
The site wasn't discovered until 2013 as its whole structure could only be visible via Google Earth satellite imagery.
The whole paddy field, locally known as Bihu Loukon, is now protected and announced as historical monument and site by the government of Manipur in the same year.
The site is situated 12 km aerial distance from Kangla with the GPS coordinates of 24° 48' N and 93° 49' E.
It covers a total area of around 224,161.45 square meters.
This square mandala has four similar protruding rectangular ‘gates’ in the cardinal directions guarded each by similar but smaller rectangular ‘gates’ on the left and right.
Within the square there is an eight petalled flower or rayed-star, recently called as Maklang ‘Star fort’ by the locals, in the centre covering a total area of around 50,836.66 square meters.
The discovery of other five giant mandalas in the valley of Manipur is also made with Google Earth.
The five giant mandalas, viz., Sekmai mandala, Heikakmapal mandala, Phurju twin mandalas and Sangolmang mandala are located on the western bank of the Iril River.
Another two fairly large mandala shaped geoglyph at Nongren and Keinou are also reported from Manipur valley, India, in 2019.
They are named as Nongren mandala and Keinou mandala.
In politics.
The "Rajamandala" (or "Raja-mandala"; circle of states) was formulated by the Indian author Kautilya in his work on politics, the "Arthashastra" (written between 4th century BCE and 2nd century BCE).
It describes circles of friendly and enemy states surrounding the king's state.
In historical, social and political sense, the term "mandala" is also employed to denote traditional Southeast Asian political formations (such as federation of kingdoms or vassalized states).
It was adopted by 20th century Western historians from ancient Indian political discourse as a means of avoiding the term 'state' in the conventional sense.
Not only did Southeast Asian polities not conform to Chinese and European views of a territorially defined state with fixed borders and a bureaucratic apparatus, but they diverged considerably in the opposite direction: the polity was defined by its centre rather than its boundaries, and it could be composed of numerous other tributary polities without undergoing administrative integration.
Empires such as Bagan, Ayutthaya, Champa, Khmer, Srivijaya and Majapahit are known as "mandala" in this sense.
In contemporary use.
Fashion designer Mandali Mendrilla designed an interactive art installation called Mandala of Desires (Blue Lotus Wish Tree) made in peace silk and eco friendly textile ink, displayed at the China Art Museum in Shanghai in November 2015.
The pattern of the dress was based on the Goloka Yantra mandala, shaped as a lotus with eight petals.
Visitors were invited to place a wish on the sculpture dress, which will be taken to India and offered to a genuine living Wish Tree.
Implicate and explicate order 
Implicate order and explicate order are ontological concepts for quantum theory coined by theoretical physicist David Bohm during the early 1980s.
They are used to describe two different frameworks for understanding the same phenomenon or aspect of reality.
In particular, the concepts were developed in order to explain the bizarre behaviors of subatomic particles which quantum physics describes and predicts with elegant precision but struggles to explain.
In Bohm's "Wholeness and the Implicate Order", he used these notions to describe how the appearance of such phenomena might appear differently, or might be characterized by, varying principal factors, depending on contexts such as scales.
The implicate (also referred to as the "enfolded") order is seen as a deeper and more fundamental order of reality.
In contrast, the explicate or "unfolded" order includes the abstractions that humans normally perceive.
As he wrote:  
Overview.
The notion of implicate and explicate orders emphasizes the primacy of structure and process over individual objects.
The latter are seen as mere approximations of an underlying process.
In this approach, quantum particles and other objects are understood to have only a limited degree of stability and autonomy.
Bohm believed that the weirdness of the behavior of quantum particles is caused by unobserved forces, maintaining that space and time might actually be derived from an even deeper level of objective reality.
In the words of F. David Peat, Bohm considered that what we take for reality are "surface phenomena, explicate forms that have temporarily unfolded out of an underlying implicate order."
That is, the implicate order is the ground from which reality emerges.
The implicate order as an algebra.
Bohm, his co-worker Basil Hiley, and other physicists of Birkbeck College worked toward a model of quantum physics in which the implicate order is represented in the form of an appropriate algebra or other pregeometry.
They considered spacetime itself as part of an explicate order that is connected to an implicate order that they called "pre-space."
The spacetime manifold and the properties of locality and nonlocality all arise from an order in such pre-space.
A.
M.
Frescura and Hiley suggested that an implicate order could be carried by an algebra, with the explicate order being contained in the various representations of this algebra.
In analogy to Alfred North Whitehead's notion of "actual occasion," Bohm considered the notion of "moment" – a moment being a not entirely localizable event, with events being allowed to overlap  and being connected in an overall implicate order: 
Bohm emphasized the primary role of the implicate order's structure: 
The explicate order and quantum entanglement.
Central to Bohm's schema are correlations between observables of entities which seem separated by great distances in the explicate order (such as a particular electron here on earth and an alpha particle in one of the stars in the Abell 1835 galaxy, then a possible candidate for farthest galaxy from Earth known to humans), manifestations of the implicate order.
Within quantum theory, there is entanglement of such objects.
This view of order necessarily departs from any notion which entails signalling, and therefore causality.
The correlation of observables does not imply a causal influence, and in Bohm's schema, the latter represents 'relatively' independent events in spacetime; and therefore explicate order.
A common grounding for consciousness and matter.
The implicate order represents the proposal of a general metaphysical concept in terms of which it is claimed that matter and consciousness might both be understood, in the sense that it is proposed that both matter and consciousness: (i) enfold the structure of the whole within each region, and (ii) involve continuous processes of enfoldment and unfoldment.
For example, in the case of matter, entities such as atoms may represent continuous enfoldment and unfoldment which manifests as a relatively stable and autonomous entity that can be observed to follow a relatively well-defined path in spacetime.
In the case of consciousness, Bohm pointed toward evidence presented by Karl Pribram that memories may be enfolded within every region of the brain rather than being localized (for example, in particular regions of the brain, cells, or atoms).
Bohm went on to say: As in our discussion of matter in general, it is now necessary to go into the question of how in consciousness the explicate order is what is manifest ... the manifest content of consciousness is based essentially on memory, which is what allows such content to be held in a fairly constant form.
Of course, to make possible such constancy it is also necessary that this content be organized, not only through relatively fixed association but also with the aid of the rules of logic, and of our basic categories of space, time, causality, universality, etc. ... there will be a strong background of recurrent, stable, and separable features, against which the transitory and changing aspects of the unbroken flow of experience will be seen as fleeting impressions that tend to be arranged and ordered mainly in terms of the vast totality of the relatively static and fragmented content of [memories].
Bohm also claimed that "as with consciousness, each moment has a certain explicate order, and in addition it enfolds all the others, though in its own way.
So the relationship of each moment in the whole to all the others is implied by its total content: the way in which it 'holds' all the others enfolded within it."
Bohm characterises consciousness as a process in which at each moment, content that was previously implicate is presently explicate, and content which was previously explicate has become implicate.
One may indeed say that our memory is a special case of the process described above, for all that is recorded is held enfolded within the brain cells and these are part of matter in general.
The recurrence and stability of our own memory as a relatively independent sub-totality is thus brought about as part of the very same process that sustains the recurrence and stability in the manifest order of matter in general.
It follows, then, that the explicate and manifest order of consciousness is not ultimately distinct from that of matter in general.
Analogies.
Ink droplet analogy.
Bohm also used the term "unfoldment" to characterise processes in which the explicate order becomes relevant (or "relevated").
Bohm likens unfoldment also to the decoding of a television signal to produce a sensible image on a screen.
The signal, screen, and television electronics in this analogy represent the implicate order, while the image produced represents the explicate order.
He also uses an example in which an ink droplet can be introduced into a highly viscous substance (such as glycerine), and the substance rotated very slowly, such that there is negligible diffusion of the substance.
In this example, the droplet becomes a thread, which in turn eventually becomes invisible.
However, by rotating the substance in the reverse direction, the droplet can essentially reform.
When it is invisible, according to Bohm, the order of the ink droplet as a pattern can be said to be "implicate" within the substance.
In another analogy, Bohm asks us to consider a pattern produced by making small cuts in a folded piece of paper and then, literally, unfolding it.
Widely separated elements of the pattern are, in actuality, produced by the same original cut in the folded piece of paper.
Here, the cuts in the folded paper represent the implicate order, and the unfolded pattern represents the explicate order.
Holograms and implicate order.
Bohm employed the hologram as a means of characterising implicate order, noting that each region of a photographic plate in which a hologram is observable contains within it the whole three-dimensional image, which can be viewed from a range of perspectives.
That is, each region contains a whole and undivided image.
In Bohm's words: 
There is the germ of a new notion of order here.
This order is not to be understood solely in terms of a regular arrangement of objects (e.g., in rows) or as a regular arrangement of events (e.g., in a series).
Rather, a total order is contained, in some implicit sense, in each region of space and time.
Now, the word 'implicit' is based on the verb 'to implicate'.
This means 'to fold inward' ... so we may be led to explore the notion that in some sense each region contains a total structure 'enfolded' within it".
Bohm noted that, although the hologram conveys undivided wholeness, it is nevertheless static.
In this view of order, laws represent invariant relationships between explicate entities and structures, and thus Bohm maintained that, in physics, the explicate order generally reveals itself within well-constructed experimental contexts as, for example, in the sensibly observable results of instruments.
With respect to implicate order, however, Bohm asked us to consider the possibility instead "that physical law should refer primarily to an order of undivided wholeness of the content of description similar to that indicated by the hologram rather than to an order of analysis of such content into separate parts...".
Implicate order in art.
In the work "Science, Order, and Creativity" (Bohm and Peat, 1987), examples of implicate orders in science are laid out, as well as implicate orders which relate to painting, poetry and music.
Bohm and Peat emphasize the role of orders of varying complexity, which influence the perception of a work of art as a whole.
They note that implicate orders are accessible to human experience.
They refer, for instance, to earlier notes which reverberate when listening to music, or various resonances of words and images which are perceived when reading or hearing poetry.
Christopher Alexander discussed his work in person with Bohm, and pointed out connections among his work and Bohm's notion of an implicate order in "The Nature of Order".
Bohm features as a fictional character in the novel "The Wave" by British author Lochlan Bloom.
The novel includes multiple narratives and explores many of the concepts of Bohm's work on implicate and explicate orders.
Challenges to some generally prevailing views.
In proposing this new notion of order, Bohm explicitly challenged a number of tenets that he believed are fundamental to much scientific work: 
Bohm's proposals have at times been dismissed largely on the basis of such tenets.
His paradigm is generally opposed to reductionism, and some view it as a form of ontological holism.
On this, Bohm noted of prevailing views among physicists that "the world is assumed to be constituted of a set of separately existent, indivisible, and unchangeable 'elementary particles', which are the fundamental 'building blocks' of the entire universe ... there seems to be an unshakable faith among physicists that either such particles, or some other kind yet to be discovered, will eventually make possible a complete and coherent explanation of everything" ().
In Bohm's conception of order, primacy is given to the undivided whole, and the implicate order inherent within the whole, rather than to parts of the whole, such as particles, quantum states, and continua.
This whole encompasses all things, structures, abstractions, and processes, including processes that result in (relatively) stable structures as well as those that involve a metamorphosis of structures or things.
In this view, parts may be entities normally regarded as physical, such as atoms or subatomic particles, but they may also be abstract entities, such as quantum states.
Whatever their nature and character, according to Bohm, these parts are considered in terms of the whole, and in such terms, they constitute relatively separate and independent "sub-totalities."
The implication of the view is, therefore, that nothing is "fundamentally" separate or independent.
, said: "The new form of insight can perhaps best be called Undivided Wholeness in Flowing Movement.
This view implies that flow is in some sense prior to that of the ‘things’ that can be seen to form and dissolve in this flow."
According to Bohm, a vivid image of this sense of analysis of the whole is afforded by vortex structures in a flowing stream.
Such vortices can be relatively stable patterns within a continuous flow, but such an analysis does not imply that the flow patterns have any sharp division, or that they are literally separate and independently existent entities; rather, they are most fundamentally undivided.
Thus, according to Bohm’s view, the whole is in continuous flux, and hence is referred to as the holomovement (movement of the whole).
Quantum theory and relativity theory.
A key motivation for Bohm in proposing a new notion of order was the well-known incompatibility of quantum theory with relativity theory. summarised the state of affairs he perceived to exist: 
...in relativity, movement is continuous, causally determinate and well defined, while in quantum mechanics it is discontinuous, not causally determinate and not well-defined.
Each theory is committed to its own notions of essentially static and fragmentary modes of existence (relativity to that of separate events connectible by , and quantum mechanics to a well-defined quantum state).
One thus sees that a new kind of theory is needed which drops these basic commitments and at most recovers some essential features of the older theories as abstract forms derived from a deeper reality in which what prevails is unbroken wholeness.
Bohm maintained that relativity and quantum theories are in basic contradiction in these essential respects, and that a new concept of order should begin with that toward which both theories point: undivided wholeness.
This should not be taken to mean that he advocated such powerful theories be discarded.
He argued that each was relevant in a certain context—i.e., a set of interrelated conditions within the explicate order—rather than having unlimited scope, and that apparent contradictions stem from attempts to overgeneralize by superposing the theories on one another, implying greater generality or broader relevance than is ultimately warranted.
Thus, argued: "... in sufficiently broad contexts such analytic descriptions cease to be adequate ... 'the law of the whole' will generally include the possibility of describing the 'loosening' of aspects from each other, so that they will be relatively autonomous in limited contexts ... however, any form of relative (and ) is ultimately limited by holonomy, so that in a broad enough context such forms are seen to be merely aspects, relevated in the holomovement, rather than disjoint and separately existent things in interaction."
Hidden variable theory.
Before developing his "implicit order" approach, Bohm had proposed a hidden variable theory of quantum physics (see Bohm interpretation).
According to Bohm, a key motivation for doing so had been purely to show the possibility of such theories.
On this, said, "... it should be kept in mind that before this proposal was made there had existed the widespread impression that no conception of any hidden variable at all, not even if it were abstract and hypothetical, could possibly be consistent with the quantum theory."
also claimed that "the demonstration of the possibility of theories of hidden variables may serve in a more general philosophical sense to remind us of the unreliability of conclusions based on the assumption of the complete universality of certain features of a given theory, however general their domain of validity seems to be."
Another aspect of Bohm's motivation had been to point out a confusion he perceived to exist in quantum theory.
On the dominant approaches in quantum theory, he said: "...we wish merely to point out that this whole line of approach re-establishes at the abstract level of statistical potentialities the same kind of analysis into separate and autonomous components in interaction that is denied at the more concrete level of individual objects" ().
Qigong 
Qigong (), qi gong, chi kung, chi 'ung, or chi gung () is a system of coordinated body-posture and movement, breathing, and meditation used for the purposes of health, spirituality, and martial-arts training.
With roots in Chinese medicine, philosophy, and martial arts, "qigong" is traditionally viewed by the Chinese and throughout Asia as a practice to cultivate and balance "qi" (pronounced approximately as "chee"), translated as "life energy".
"Qigong" practice typically involves moving meditation, coordinating slow-flowing movement, deep rhythmic breathing, and a calm meditative state of mind.
People practice "qigong" throughout China and worldwide for recreation, exercise, relaxation, preventive medicine, self-healing, alternative medicine, meditation, self-cultivation, and training for martial arts.
Etymology.
"Qigong" (Pinyin), "ch'i kung" (Wade-Giles), and "chi gung" (Yale) are Romanized words for two Chinese characters: qì ('／') and gōng ().
"Qi" (or "chi") primarily means air, gas or breath but is often translated as a metaphysical concept of 'vital energy', referring to a supposed energy circulating through the body; though a more general definition is universal energy, including heat, light, and electromagnetic energy; and definitions often involve breath, air, gas, or the relationship between matter, energy, and spirit.
"Qi" is the central underlying principle in traditional Chinese medicine and martial arts.
"Gong" (or "kung") is often translated as cultivation or work, and definitions include practice, skill, mastery, merit, achievement, service, result, or accomplishment, and is often used to mean gongfu (kung fu) in the traditional sense of achievement through great effort.
The two words are combined to describe systems to cultivate and balance life energy, especially for health and wellbeing.
The term "qigong" as currently used was promoted in the late 1940s through the 1950s to refer to a broad range of Chinese self-cultivation exercises, and to emphasize health and scientific approaches, while de-emphasizing spiritual practices, mysticism, and elite lineages.
History and origins.
With roots in ancient Chinese culture dating back more than 2,000 years, a wide variety of "qigong" forms have developed within different segments of Chinese society: in traditional Chinese medicine for preventive and curative functions; in Confucianism to promote longevity and improve moral character; in Taoism and Buddhism as part of meditative practice; and in Chinese martial arts to enhance self defending abilities.
Contemporary "qigong" blends diverse and sometimes disparate traditions, in particular the Taoist meditative practice of "internal alchemy" (Neidan ), the ancient meditative practices of "circulating "qi"" ("xingqi" ) and "standing meditation" (Zhan zhuang ), and the slow gymnastic breathing exercise of "guiding and pulling" (Daoyin ).
Traditionally, "qigong" was taught by master to students through training and oral transmission, with an emphasis on meditative practice by scholars and gymnastic or dynamic practice by the working masses.
Starting in the late 1940s and the 1950s, the mainland Chinese government tried to integrate disparate "qigong" approaches into one coherent system, with the intention of establishing a firm scientific basis for "qigong" practice.
In 1949, Liu Guizhen established the name "Qigong" to refer to the system of life-preserving practices that he and his associates developed, based on Dao yin and other philosophical traditions.
This attempt is considered by some sinologists as the start of the modern or scientific interpretation of "qigong".
During the Great Leap Forward (1958–1963) and the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), "qigong", along with other traditional Chinese medicine, was under tight control with limited access among the general public, but was encouraged in state-run rehabilitation centers and spread to universities and hospitals.
After the Cultural Revolution, "qigong", along with t'ai chi, was popularized as daily morning exercise practiced en masse throughout China.
Popularity of "qigong" grew rapidly during the Deng and Jiang eras after Mao Zedong's death in 1976 through the 1990s, with estimates of between 60 and 200 million practitioners throughout China.
Along with popularity and state sanction came controversy and problems: claims of extraordinary abilities bordering on the supernatural, pseudoscience explanations to build credibility, a mental condition labeled "qigong" deviation, formation of cults, and exaggeration of claims by masters for personal benefit.
In 1985, the state-run National Qigong Science and Research Organization was established to regulate the nation's "qigong" denominations.
In 1999, in response to widespread revival of old traditions of spirituality, morality, and mysticism, and perceived challenges to State control, the Chinese government took measures to enforce control of public "qigong" practice, including shutting down "qigong" clinics and hospitals, and banning groups such as Zhong Gong and Falun Gong.
Since the 1999 crackdown, "qigong" research and practice have only been officially supported in the context of health and traditional Chinese medicine.
The Chinese Health Qigong Association, established in 2000, strictly regulates public "qigong" practice, with limitation of public gatherings, requirement of state approved training and certification of instructors, and restriction of practice to state-approved forms.
Through the forces of migration of the Chinese diaspora, tourism in China, and globalization, the practice of "qigong" spread from the Chinese community to the world.
Today, millions of people around the world practice "qigong" and believe in the benefits of "qigong" to varying degrees.
Similar to its historical origin, those interested in qigong come from diverse backgrounds and practice it for different reasons, including for recreation, exercise, relaxation, preventive medicine, self-healing, alternative medicine, self-cultivation, meditation, spirituality, and martial arts training.
Overview.
Practices.
"Qigong" comprises a diverse set of practices that coordinate body (), breath (), and mind () based on Chinese philosophy.
Practices include moving and still meditation, massage, chanting, sound meditation, and non-contact treatments, performed in a broad array of body postures.
"Qigong" is commonly classified into two foundational categories: 1) dynamic or active "qigong" ("dong gong"), with slow flowing movement; and 2) meditative or passive "qigong" ("jing gong"), with still positions and inner movement of the breath.
From a therapeutic perspective, "qigong" can be classified into two systems: 
1) internal "qigong", which focuses on self-care and self-cultivation, and; 
2) external "qigong", which involves treatment by a therapist who directs or transmits "qi".
As moving meditation, "qigong" practice typically coordinates slow stylized movement, deep diaphragmatic breathing, and calm mental focus, with visualization of guiding "qi" through the body.
While implementation details vary, generally "qigong" forms can be characterized as a mix of four types of practice: dynamic, static, meditative, and activities requiring external aids.
Forms.
There are numerous "qigong" forms. 75 ancient forms that can be found in ancient literature and also 56 common or contemporary forms have been described in a "qigong" compendium.
The list is by no means exhaustive.
Many contemporary forms were developed by people who had recovered from their illness after "qigong" practice.
Most of the "qigong" forms come under the following categories: 
Development of "health "qigong"".
In 1995, there was Qigong Talent Bank, an organization of Science Research of Chinese Qigong, functioning as network system of the senior Chinese qigong talents in China.
In order to promote "qigong" exercises in a standardised and effective way with a scientific approach, The Chinese Health Qigong Association (CHQA) appointed panels of Qigong experts, Chinese medicine doctors and sport science professors from different hospitals, universities and "qigong "lineage across China to research and develop new sets of "qigong" exercises.
In 2003 the CHQA officially promoted a new system called "health "qigong"", which consisted of four newly developed health "qigong" forms: 
In 2010, the Chinese Health Qigong Association officially introduced five additional health "qigong" forms: 
Other commonly practised "qigong" styles and forms include: 
Techniques.
Whether viewed from the perspective of exercise, health, philosophy, or martial arts training, several main principles emerge concerning the practice of qigong: 
Additional principles: 
Advanced goals: 
The most advanced practice is generally considered to be with little or no motion.
Traditional and classical theory.
Over time, five distinct traditions or schools of "qigong" developed in China, each with its own theories and characteristics: Chinese Medical Qigong, Daoist Qigong, Buddhist Qigong, Confucian Qigong, and Martial Qigong.
All of these "qigong" traditions include practices intended to cultivate and balance "qi".
Traditional Chinese medicine.
The theories of ancient Chinese "qigong" include the Yin-Yang and Five Phases Theory, Essence-"Qi"-Spirit Theory, Zang-Xiang Theory, and Meridians and "Qi"-Blood Theory, which have been synthesized as part of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).
TCM focuses on tracing and correcting underlying disharmony, in terms of deficiency and excess, using the complementary and opposing forces of yin and yang (), to create a balanced flow of "qi".
"Qi" is believed to be cultivated and stored in three main dantian energy centers and to travel through the body along twelve main meridians (Jīng Luò ), with numerous smaller branches and tributaries.
The main meridians correspond to twelve main organs ) (Zàng fǔ ).
"Qi" is balanced in terms of yin and yang in the context of the traditional system of Five Phases (Wu xing ).
A person is believed to become ill or die when "qi" becomes diminished or unbalanced.
Health is believed to be returned by rebuilding "qi", eliminating "qi" blockages, and correcting "qi" imbalances.
These TCM concepts do not translate readily to modern science and medicine.
Daoism.
In Daoism, various practices now known as Daoist "qigong" are claimed to provide a way to achieve longevity and spiritual enlightenment, as well as a closer connection with the natural world.
For instance, the Ming dynasty compendium "Chifeng sui", written by a Daoist ascetic, lists various "qigong"-based "longevity methods".
Buddhism.
In Buddhism meditative practices now known as Buddhist "qigong" are part of a spiritual path that leads to spiritual enlightenment or Buddhahood.
Confucianism.
In Confucianism practices now known as Confucian "qigong" provide a means to become a Junzi () through awareness of morality.
Contemporary qigong.
In contemporary China, the emphasis of "qigong" practice has shifted away from traditional philosophy, spiritual attainment, and folklore, and increasingly to health benefits, traditional medicine and martial arts applications, and a scientific perspective.
"Qigong" is now practiced by millions worldwide, primarily for its health benefits, though many practitioners have also adopted traditional philosophical, medical, or martial arts perspectives, and even use the long history of "qigong" as evidence of its effectiveness.
Contemporary Chinese medical qigong.
"Qigong" has been recognized as a "standard medical technique" in China since 1989, and is sometimes included in the medical curriculum of major universities in China.
The 2013 English translation of the official Chinese Medical Qigong textbook used in China defines CMQ as "the skill of body-mind exercise that integrates body, breath, and mind adjustments into one" and emphasizes that "qigong" is based on "adjustment" (tiao , also translated as "regulation", "tuning", or "alignment") of body, breath, and mind.
As such, "qigong" is viewed by practitioners as being more than common physical exercise, because "qigong" combines postural, breathing, and mental training in one to produce a particular psychophysiological state of being.
While CMQ is still based on traditional and classical theory, modern practitioners also emphasize the importance of a strong scientific basis.
According to the 2013 CMQ textbook, physiological effects of "qigong" are numerous, and include improvement of respiratory and cardiovascular function, and possibly neurophysiological function.
Conventional medicine.
Especially since the 1990s, conventional or mainstream Western medicine often strives to heed the model of evidence-based medicine, EBM, which demotes medical theory, clinical experience, and physiological data to prioritize the results of controlled, and especially randomized, clinical trials of the treatment itself.
Although some clinical trials support qigong's effectiveness in treating conditions diagnosed in Western medicine, the quality of these studies is mostly low and, overall, their results are mixed.
Integrative, complementary, and alternative medicine.
Integrative medicine (IM) refers to "the blending of conventional and complementary medicines and therapies with the aim of using the most appropriate of either or both modalities to care for the patient as a whole", whereas complementary is using a non-mainstream approach together with conventional medicine, while alternative is using a non-mainstream approach in place of conventional medicine.
"Qigong" is used by integrative medicine practitioners to complement conventional medical treatment, based on complementary and alternative medicine interpretations of the effectiveness and safety of "qigong".
Scientific basis.
Scientists interested in "qigong" have sought to describe or verify the effects of "qigong", to explore mechanisms of effects, to form scientific theory with respect to "qigong", and to identify appropriate research methodology for further study.
In terms of traditional theory, the existence of "qi" has not been independently verified in an experimental setting.
In any case, some researches have reported effects on pathophysiological parameters of biomedical interest.
Practitioners, uses and cautions.
Recreation and popular use.
People practice "qigong" for many different reasons, including for recreation, exercise and relaxation, preventive medicine and self-healing, meditation and self-cultivation, and training for martial arts.
Practitioners range from athletes to people with disabilities.
Because it is low impact and can be done lying, sitting, or standing, "qigong" is accessible for people with disabilities, seniors, and people recovering from injuries.
Therapeutic use.
Therapeutic use of "qigong" is directed by TCM, CAM, integrative medicine, and other health practitioners.
In China, where it is considered a "standard medical technique", "qigong" is commonly prescribed to treat a wide variety of conditions, and clinical applications include hypertension, coronary artery disease, peptic ulcers, chronic liver diseases, diabetes mellitus, obesity, menopause syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, insomnia, tumors and cancer, lower back and leg pain, cervical spondylosis, and myopia.
Outside China "qigong" is used in integrative medicine to complement or supplement accepted medical treatments, including for relaxation, fitness, rehabilitation, and treatment of specific conditions.
However, there is no high-quality evidence that "qigong" is actually effective for these conditions.
Based on systematic reviews of clinical research, there is insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of using "qigong" as a therapy for any medical condition.
Safety and cost.
"Qigong" is generally viewed as safe.
No adverse effects have been observed in clinical trials, such that "qigong" is considered safe for use across diverse populations.
Cost for self-care is minimal, and cost efficiencies are high for group delivered care.
Typically the cautions associated with "qigong" are the same as those associated with any physical activity, including risk of muscle strains or sprains, advisability of stretching to prevent injury, general safety for use alongside conventional medical treatments, and consulting with a physician when combining with conventional treatment.
Clinical research.
Overview.
Although there is ongoing clinical research examining the potential health effects of "qigong", there is little financial or medical incentive to support high-quality research, and still only a limited number of studies meet accepted medical and scientific standards of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
Clinical research concerning "qigong" has been conducted for a wide range of medical conditions, including bone density, cardiopulmonary effects, physical function, falls and related risk factors, quality of life, immune function, inflammation, hypertension, pain, and cancer treatment.
Systematic reviews.
A 2009 systematic review on the effect of "qigong" exercises on reducing pain concluded that "the existing trial evidence is not convincing enough to suggest that internal qigong is an effective modality for pain management."
A 2010 systematic review of the effect of "qigong" exercises on cancer treatment concluded "the effectiveness of qigong in cancer care is not yet supported by the evidence from rigorous clinical trials."
A separate systematic review that looked at the effects of qigong exercises on various physiological or psychological outcomes found that the available studies were poorly designed, with a high risk of bias in the results.
Therefore, the authors concluded, "Due to limited number of RCTs in the field and methodological problems and high risk of bias in the included studies, it is still too early to reach a conclusion about the efficacy and the effectiveness of qigong exercise as a form of health practice adopted by the cancer patients during their curative, palliative, and rehabilitative phases of the cancer journey."
A 2011 overview of systematic reviews of controlled clinical trials, Lee et al. concluded that "the effectiveness of qigong is based mostly on poor quality research" and "therefore, it would be unwise to draw firm conclusions at this stage."
Although a 2010 comprehensive literature review found 77 peer-reviewed RCTs, Lee et al.'s overview of systematic reviews as to particular health conditions found problems like sample size, lack of proper control groups, with lack of blinding associated with high risk of bias.
A 2015 systematic review of the effect of "qigong" exercises on cardiovascular diseases and hypertension found no conclusive evidence for effect.
Also in 2015, a systemic review into the effects on hypertension suggested that it may be effective, but that the evidence was not conclusive because of the poor quality of the trials it included, and advised more rigorous research in the future.
Another 2015 systematic review of "qigong" on biomarkers of cardiovascular disease concluded that some trials showed favorable effects, but concludes, "Most of the trials included in this review are likely to be at high risk of bias, so we have very low confidence in the validity of the results.
Mental health.
Many claims have been made that "qigong" can benefit or ameliorate mental health conditions, including improved mood, decreased stress reaction, and decreased anxiety and depression.
Most medical studies have only examined psychological factors as secondary goals, although various studies have shown decreases in cortisol levels, a chemical hormone produced by the body in response to stress.
China.
Basic and clinical research in China during the 1980s was mostly descriptive, and few results were reported in peer-reviewed English-language journals.
"Qigong" became known outside China in the 1990s, and clinical randomized controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of "qigong" on health and mental conditions began to be published worldwide, along with systematic reviews.
Challenges.
Most existing clinical trials have small sample sizes and many have inadequate controls.
Of particular concern is the impracticality of double blinding using appropriate sham treatments, and the difficulty of placebo control, such that benefits often cannot be distinguished from the placebo effect.
Also of concern is the choice of which "qigong" form to use and how to standardize the treatment or amount with respect to the skill of the practitioner leading or administering treatment, the tradition of individualization of treatments, and the treatment length, intensity, and frequency.
Meditation and self-cultivation applications.
"Qigong" is practiced for meditation and self-cultivation as part of various philosophical and spiritual traditions.
As meditation, "qigong" is a means to still the mind and enter a state of consciousness that brings serenity, clarity, and bliss.
Many practitioners find "qigong", with its gentle focused movement, to be more accessible than seated meditation.
"Qigong" for self-cultivation can be classified in terms of traditional Chinese philosophy: Daoist, Buddhist, and Confucian.
Martial arts applications.
The practice of "qigong" is an important component in both internal and external style Chinese martial arts.
Focus on "qi" is considered to be a source of power as well as the foundation of the internal style of martial arts (Neijia).
T'ai Chi Ch'uan, Xing Yi Quan, and Baguazhang are representative of the types of Chinese martial arts that rely on the concept of "qi" as the foundation.
Extraordinary feats of martial arts prowess, such as the ability to withstand heavy strikes (Iron Shirt, ) and the ability to break hard objects (Iron Palm, ) are abilities attributed to "qigong" training.
T'ai Chi Ch'uan and "qigong".
"T'ai Chi Ch'uan" (Taijiquan) is a widely practiced Chinese internal martial style based on the theory of taiji, closely associated with "qigong", and typically involving more complex choreographed movement coordinated with breath, done slowly for health and training, or quickly for self-defense.
Many scholars consider t'ai chi ch'uan to be a type of "qigong", traced back to an origin in the seventeenth century.
In modern practice, "qigong" typically focuses more on health and meditation rather than martial applications, and plays an important role in training for t'ai chi ch'uan, in particular used to build strength, develop breath control, and increase vitality ("life energy").
Egonomics 
"At the core of Egonomics is the idea that within each individual exists two selves: the past or future self and the present self, constantly at odds, leading to a sort of cognitive dissonance between the two.
Both selves exist within us and are equally valid, but aren’t always active at the same time.
It’s a natural and ongoing conflict between immediate desire and long-term desires, we call longing."
Egonomics is the pursuit of awareness of that longing.
(Gaurav, 2022)  
Overview.
‘Egonomics’, coined by Thomas Schelling in his paper “Egonomics, or the Art of Self-Management”, is a theory which builds upon the observation that individuals place too much emphasis on attaining short-term gratification at the expense of realising future benefits.
The novel insight of Schelling’s paper comes from his theoretical framing of this fact, proposing that there is a conflict between different ‘selves’ within the mind of the decision maker.
From this, Schelling proposed a set of self-management solutions to overcome this problem.
This understanding of egonomics has been important in the development of economics and psychology and behavioural economics.
Egonomics' theoretical basis.
The key theory which supports Schelling’s work is that of time inconsistency.
Schelling summarises what time inconsistency problem is in the following quote: 
"What I have in mind is an act or decision that a person takes [based upon] preferences [that] differ from what they were earlier...If the person could make the final decision about that action at the earlier time, precluding a later change in mind, he would make a different choice ...
(Schelling, 1978) 
This framework is used by Schelling to explain the reasons for the prevalence of phenomena like smoking or the high failure rate of diets.
According to egonomics, although most people acknowledge dieting leads to individual benefits (such as improved health), this benefit is realised far in the future from the decision to start dieting.
In addition, dieting imposes immediate costs on the individual (such as the opportunity cost of not eating sugary foods).
Since individuals often prioritise short term concerns over long term ones, they will ignore self-acknowledged long-term benefits of dieting because of short term temptations.
In turn, this leads them to break their diets, even though their optimal decision is to continue with it.
The ‘self’ which makes this irrational decision is what Schelling refers to as the wayward self.
Only after the diet is broken to individuals recognise the mistake of this ‘other self’ and regret their decision.
Schelling characterises this as the straight self.
Modern understanding of egonomics.
Shelling’s theoretical framework for understanding egonomics has been updated by Chatterjee and Krishna (2009).
They draw inspiration from Schelling’s ‘dual self’ categorisation but use this to demonstrate how an individual could rationally prioritise current benefits at the expense of those in the future, even if future benefits were greater in absolute terms.
This departs from Schelling’s idea that short-term thinking is totally irrational behaviour.
The authors redefine these two selves as being in a ‘hot state’ and a ‘cold state’, referring to Schelling’s wayward and straight definitions respectively.
They propose that the extent to which individuals prioritise current consumptions depends on both the future benefit’s size and how far in the future they’re realised.
They model this through the incorporation of a discount factor (δ).
This represents the loss in utility of the future benefit to the individual because of the time they must wait to attain it.
Accordingly, even if in the future the benefit from dieting may be larger than that of breaking it, if the future benefit is distant enough or too small, individuals could rationally choose the smaller but immediate option.
It is important to note though that when this future arrives, Chatterjee and Krishna’s updated theory still concurs with Shelling’s conclusion that the individual wishes they had been patient.
There has also been significant literature seeking to define a quantitative value for this discount factor (Giwa et al, 2021), but most studies have found its size depends on the context in question and the cultural background of the individual (Ishii et al, 2017).
This paper finds this is especially true when comparing W.E.I.R.D. (western, educated, industrialised, rich and democratic) societies (American) to non-W.E.I.R.D. societies (Japan).
This is an active area of research in both economics and psychology.
Incorporation into modern literature.
Psychology.
Salas-Morellon et al (2021) demonstrate the prevalence of time inconsistencies among our closest evolutionary relatives (bonobos, orangutans, and gorillas), suggesting that time inconsistency ‘is part of our evolutionary heritage’.
Hayden (2018) outlines an ultimate reason for the evolutionary selection of time inconsistent preferences observed by Schelling, while also explaining why this adaption is no longer optimal in modern society.
He argues time inconsistency, or impatience, was evolutionarily selected for because in a world of insecurity (or ‘bounded optimality’), there was often little evolutionary benefits of patience because individuals would often not survive long enough to realise them.
Due to greater security in the modern world, now individuals are more likely to realise the benefits of greater patience.
This means that evolved impatience is not as beneficial as it once was.
Economics.
Harstad (2020) identifies time inconsistency, the theory central to egonomics, as a key factor in explaining the underinvestment in greener technologies by politicians today.
He argues that rational individuals would invest more in green technologies than the current amount due to the costs of not doing so, but an underappreciation of the future costs and the significant political costs of doing so ensure that politicians continue to underinvest.
Egonomics' Solutions.
Egonomics not only seeks to understand time inconsistencies, but also propose solutions to overcome issues relating to time inconsistencies.
Schelling suggested a number of strategies for dealing with this issue.
These included precommitment, use of bright line rules, delay tactics, or creating a pre-arranged deal between selves.
There has been significant academic debate since Schelling’s initial recommendations.
Most notably, Duckworth et al (2014) noted the distinction between proactive and reactive strategies.
Proactive strategies are instances where control strategies are implemented in anticipation of a situation whereas reactive ones are only implemented once there is an immediate need for them.
The authors favour proactive strategies because they can encourage a ‘self-control cycle’, whereby early exercises of self-control lead to more in the future.
Indeed, Duckworth (2016) show proactive self-control strategies lead to better grades amongst students than reactive strategies.
Example Of Proactive Self-control Strategy.
Precommitment is the most common tool advanced within egonomics.
Elster’s Theory (1985) states that precommitment can help humans ‘achieve rationality by indirect means’ as it limits the potential for temptation, as demonstrated in ‘The Ulysses Problem’.
This prevents them from succumbing to short term temptations and attaining the desired outcome.
This is also shown in recent work by Dresser (2021).
Problems.
Dresser (2021) cite ethical problems related to precommitment devices, specifically within medical contexts such as the Opioid Crisis.
Relating to preventative medicine, she notes issues around informed consent and the ability of individuals to compel their doctor to cease the precommitment agreement.
However, Dineen (2021) explains how the same commitment device helps doctors when patients refuse lifesaving treatment.
This topic is still hotly debated within the literature.
Gnosis (chaos magic) 
In chaos magic, gnosis or the gnostic state refers to an altered state of consciousness in which a person's mind is focused on only one point, thought, or goal and all other thoughts are thrust out.
The gnostic state is used to bypass the "filter" of the conscious mind – something thought to be necessary for working most forms of magic.
Since it takes years of training to master this sort of Zen-like meditative ability, chaos magicians employ a variety of other ways to attain a "brief 'no-mind' state" in which to work magic.
Etymology.
"Gnosis" is the common Greek noun for knowledge (γνῶσις, "gnôsis", f.).
A related term is the adjective "gnostikos", "cognitive", a reasonably common adjective in Classical Greek.
Plato uses the plural adjective γνωστικοί – "gnostikoi" and the singular feminine adjective γνωστικὴ ἐπιστήμη – "gnostike episteme" in his "Politikos" where "Gnostike episteme" was also used to indicate one's aptitude.
Chaos magic.
According to chaos magic, successfully executing an act of magic is dependent on bypassing the conscious mind.
To achieve this, it is necessary to enter into an altered state of consciousness in which thoughts are stilled, and awareness is held on a single point.
Only then will the ritual, sigil or working flow unimpeded into the unconscious, from where it works its effects.
Without any etymological justification, the earliest texts on chaos magic, "Liber Null" (1978) and "The Book of Results" (1978), both refer to this state of one-pointedness as "gnosis": 
The particular state of mind required has a name in every tradition: No-mind.
Stopping the internal dialogue, passing through the eye of the needle, "ain" or nothing, "samadhi", or onepointedness.
In this book it will be known as "Gnosis".
It is an extension of the magical trance by other means.
In asserting the necessity of attaining such a state, the earliest chaos magicians were following the example set by artist and occultist Austin Osman Spare.
In Spare's magical system, magic was thought to operate by using symbols to communicate "desire" to something Spare termed "Kia" (a sort of universal mind, of which individual human consciousnesses are aspects) via the "passage" of the unconscious.
These desires would then grow, unconsciously, into "obsessions", which would culminate in magical results occurring in reality.
Aleister Crowley had also argued that the key to magic was an altered state of consciousness, whether attained through meditation, sexual practices or the use of drugs.
However, the real breakthrough of the early chaos magicians was the realisation that there are many states of exhaustion, arousal or inhibition that cause consciousness to briefly "blink", sidestepping the need for years of meditative attainment.
Three main types of gnosis are described in chaos magic texts: 
Chu (Taoism) 
Chu (, ) is a Daoist name used for various religious practices including communal "chu" (Kitchen) banquet rituals in Way of the Celestial Masters liturgy, the legendary "xingchu" (行廚, Mobile Kitchen) associated with Daoist "xian" ("transcendents; 'immortals'"), and "wuchu" (五廚, Five Kitchens) representing the "wuzang" (五臟, Five Viscera) in "neidan" meditation techniques.
Terminology.
"Chú" ("kitchen; to cook; a cook") can be written with three Chinese characters 廚, 㕑, and 厨.
The common traditional Chinese character 廚 combines the "house radical" 广 with a phonetic indicator "shù" 尌 (joining "zhù" 壴 "drum" and "cùn" 寸 "hand"); and the variant traditional character 㕑 has "cliff radical" 厂 instead of 广.
The simplified Chinese character 厨 omits the 士 element in 壴, leading to a "graphic folk etymology" of "A 厂 'room' for cooking 豆 'beans' with your 寸 'hands'."
(Bishop 2016).
The Chinese logograph 廚 was anciently used as a loan character for "chú" 櫥 (with the "wood radical" 木, "cabinet") or "chú" 幮 ("cloth radical" 巾, "a screen used for a temporary kitchen").
The Modern Standard Chinese lexicon uses "chu" in many compound words, for instance, "chúfáng" (廚房 with 房 "room", "kitchen"), "chúshī" (廚師 with 師 "master", "cook; chef"), "chúdāo" (廚刀 with 刀 "knife", "kitchen knife"), and "páochú" (庖廚 with 庖 "kitchen", meaning "kitchen").
In Daoist specialized vocabulary, "chu" names a Kitchen-feast communal meal, and sometimes has a technical meaning of "magic", "used to designate the magical recipes through which one becomes invisible" (Maspero 1981: 290).
The extensive semantic field of "chu" can be summarized in some key Daoist expressions: ritual banquets, communion with divinities, granaries ("zang" 藏, a word that also denotes the viscera), visualization of the Five Viscera ("wuzang" 五臟, written with the "flesh radical" ⺼), and abstention from cereals ("bigu"), and other food proscriptions (Mollier 2008a: 279).
According to Daoist classics, when "bigu" "grain avoidance" techniques were successful, "xingchu" (行廚, Mobile Kitchens or "tianchu" (天廚, Celestial Kitchens) were brought in gold and jade vessels by the "yunü" (玉女, Jade Women) and "jintong" (金僮, Golden Boys), associated with the legendary Jade Emperor (Despeux 2008: 233–234).
Chinese Buddhist terminology applies "chu" (廚, cf. 櫥 "cabinet") "kitchen; kitchen cupboard" to denote the "cabinet for an image or relic of the Buddhas", translating Sanskrit "bhakta-śālā" "food-hall" or "mahânasa" "kitchen" (Digital Dictionary of Buddhism).
In Chinese astronomy, "Tiānchú" (天廚, Celestial Kitchen) is the name of an asterism in the constellation Draco, located next to "Tiānbàng" (天棓, Celestial Flail), and "Nèichú" (內廚, Inner Kitchen).
Translations.
There is no standard English translation for either Daoist "chu" (廚, Kitchen) or "xingchu" (行廚, Mobile Kitchen).
The former is rendered as: 
These Anglophone scholars render Chinese "chu" as either English "kitchen" ("a room for preparing food"), optionally clarified with "K-", -"festival" or -"feast", or "cuisine" ("a characteristic style of cooking, often associated with a place of origin").
The latter follows Francophone sinologists, for instance Maspero (1971) and Mollier (1999), who accurately translated Chinese "chu" as French "cuisine" ("kitchen; cooking") and "xingchu" as "cuisine de voyage" ("travel kitchen").
Although English "kitchen" and French "cuisine" are doublets deriving from Latin "cocīna" ("cooking; kitchen"), they are false friends with significant semantic differences between English "kitchen" and "cuisine".
Chinese usually translates English "kitchen" as chúfáng (廚房, "kitchen") and "cuisine" as "pēngrèn" (烹飪, "art of cooking").
The term "xingchu" (行廚) has been translated as 
Joseph Needham calls Ware's "Traveling Canteen" a "bizarre translation" (1976: 29).
While Maspero uniquely interprets the "xing" (行) in "xingchu" as a verb ("to perform"), the other scholars read it as a modifier ("to go; to move") translated as "traveling", "mobile", or "movable" (cf. "movable feast").
The "chu" noun in "xingchu" is translated as English "kitchen", "cuisine", or "canteen".
However, the latter ambiguous word has several meanings besides "canteen" ("a cafeteria or snack bar provided by an organization"), "canteen" ("a small water bottle"), and British English "canteen" ("a case or box containing a cutlery set").
To further complicate translating "xingchu", "travelling canteen" was the 18th-century equivalent of a picnic basket.
In modern terms, the "xingchu" is comparable with a mobile kitchen (Sivin's translation), military field kitchen, food truck, or food cart.
"Chu" Kitchen feast.
The "chu" (廚, Kitchen), also known as "fushi" (福食, "good luck meal"), was a religious banquet that usually involved preliminary fasting and purification before consuming a meal of vegetarian food and Chinese wine.
The banquet was hosted by families on the occasion of births and deaths, prepared for a ritually-fixed number of parishioners, and accompanied by specific ritual gifts to the Daoist priest.
Although the Kitchen Feast became a regular element of organized Daoist religious traditions, scholars do not know the date when it was introduced into the liturgy.
One early textual record is the c. 499 "Zhen'gao" saying that Xu Mi (許谧, 303–376) offered a Kitchen meal to five persons (Stein 1979: 57).
These communal "chu" Kitchen banquets have a pre-Daoist antecedent in popular Chinese folk religion: the term "chu" was anciently used for the ceremonial meals organized by communities to honor the "she" (社, God of the Soil).
Although orthodox Daoists criticized, and sometimes banned, these "chuhui" (廚會, "cuisine congregations") for making immoral animal sacrifices, they nevertheless perpetuated the custom by adapting and codifying it (Mollier 2008a: 279).
"Chu" kitchen-feasts have many features in common with another Daoist ritual meal, the "zhāi" (齋, "fast; purification; retreat"), and the two are frequently treated as having the same functions.
The 7th-century Daoist "Zhaijielu" (齋戒錄, Records of Fasting) suggested that "zhai" were anciently called "shehui" (社會, "festival gatherings of the soil god"—now the modern Chinese word for "society"), which was later changed into "zhaihui" (齋會) (Stein 1979: 75).
The Way of the Celestial Masters religion, founded by Zhang Daoling in 142 CE, celebrated "chu" kitchen festivals at New Year and the annual "sanhui" (三會, Three Assemblies), which were major Daoist festivals held in the first, seventh, and tenth lunar months, when believers assembled at their local parish to report any births, deaths, or marriages, so that the population registers could be updated.
Parishioners who had reason to celebrate on these occasions would host a "chu" feast for other members of the community in proportion to the significance of their auspicious event and their means.
Accounts of these banquets "emphasize both the sharing of food and the affirmation of the unique, religious merit-based social order of the Daoist community" (Kleeman 2008: 839–840).
The "chu" sacrament had three levels of banquets and ritual gifts, depending upon what the family was celebrating.
For the birth of a boy, the "shangchu" (上廚, Superior Ceremony of the Kitchen) was a banquet offered to the priest and ten members of the parish, with gifts to the priest of a hundred sheets of paper, a pair of ink brushes, an inkstick, and an ink scraper.
For the birth of a girl, it was the less expensive "zhongchu" (中廚, Middle Ceremony of the Kitchen) with a banquet for five parishioners, and the gifts, which the parents had to provide within one month following the birth, were a mat, a wastebasket, and a broom.
For the death of a family member, the "xiachu" (下廚, Inferior Ceremony of the Kitchen), also called "jiechu" (解廚, Kitchen of Deliverance), is not described in Daoist texts, and we only know that the rival Buddhist polemicists claimed it was a "great orgy" (Maspero 1981: 290).
The anti-Daoist "Erjiaolun" (二教論, Essay on Two Religions) by the Buddhist monk Dao'an (312–385) said "chu" kitchen-feasts were intended to bring about "jiěchú" (解除, "liberation and elimination") from pollution and sins, which were connected with the soil god and tombs (Stein 1979: 71).
The parallel passage in the 6th-century "Bianhuolun" (辯惑論, Essay on Debating Doubts) uses the homophonous graphic variant of "jiěchú" (解廚, "liberation kitchen"), thus connecting both "chú" "kitchen" and "chú" "liberation" to non-Daoist gods of the soil (Stein 1979: 74).
Daoist sources record that the people invited to a "chu" Kitchen feast would first observe a period of purification that included fasting and abstention from sex.
Kitchen rituals lasted for one, three, or seven days.
Participants consumed exclusively vegetarian food and moderate amounts of wine, which was considered as a mandatory element of the banquet (Mollier 2008a: 279).
For the Superior Kitchens five "sheng" of wine (about a liter) per person was planned, for the Middle Kitchens, four "sheng", and for the Inferior Kitchen three.
The participants "must have departed a bit happy, but not drunk."
(Maspero 1981: 290).
The leftovers were given to other parishioners who could thereby share in the ritual.
Besides annual festivals on fixed dates like the Three Assemblies, "chu" Kitchen ceremonies were also performed in special circumstances, particularly when there was disease, sin, or death pollution.
They were believed to have exorcistic and salvific powers and to confer good luck or merit upon the adepts (Mollier 2008a: 279).
Kitchen ceremonies often involved Daoist ritual "jiao" (醮, "offerings") of cakes and pieces of fabric in order to obtain particular favors, such as petitions for recovery from illnesses, prayers for rain in time of drought, and thanksgivings for favors received.
An altar was laid out in the open air, and the priest recited prayers (Maspero 1981: 34–35).
Ge Hong's c. 318 "Baopuzi" (see below) mentions profligately expensive "chu" Kitchen Feasts in contrasting heterodox "yaodao" (妖道, "demonic cults"), which involved sacrificing animals to gods who enjoyed their blood, with the "Lijia dao" (李家道, Way of the Li Family) (Stein 1979: 56).
The context praises the contemporary charlatan healer Li Kuan (李寬) for not following the ancient tradition of animal sacrifice, while blaming him for extravagance.
The more than a hundred ways for dealing with demons [諸妖道百餘種] all call for slaying living creatures so that their blood may be drunk.
Only the doctrine of the Lis [李家道] is slightly different.
Yet, though it does no butchering, whenever its "good-luck food" is served [每供福食], it includes varieties of mixtures without limit.
In planning the meal, one strives for sumptuousness, and the rarest things must be purchased.
Several dozen may work in the kitchen [或數十人廚], and costs for food can run high indeed.
In turn, these are not completely disinterested affairs, and they might well be classed with things to be forbidden. (tr. Ware 1966: 158)  
"Xingchu" Mobile Kitchen traditions.
In Daoist hagiographies and stories, the esoteric ability to summon a "xingchu" (行廚, Mobile Kitchen) was a standard trope for the powers of a "xian" transcendent.
The "xingchu", which Campany called a "curious business" (2002: 29), was a sumptuous banquet of rare delicacies, exotic foods, and wines that could be instantly served up by spirits anywhere on command.
The tradition of "xingchu" "meditational cuisines" or "contemplative cuisines" seems to have developed in a parallel and complementary manner to the "chu" "communal cuisine liturgy" (Mollier 2008a: 280).
"Xian" transcendents were portrayed as eschewing what counted in China as ordinary foods, especially grains (see "bigu"), and instead eating superior, longevity-inducing substitutes such as sesame seeds and "lingzhi" mushrooms, typically found in distant and legendary places removed from the heartland of agriculture-based Chinese civilization.
Transcendents were frequently depicted as winged beings able to fly long distances rapidly and summoning a "xingchu" banquet at will eliminated the need to travel across the world and heavens in order to obtain rare foodstuffs of immortality (Campany 2005: 46–47).
The Jin Dynasty Daoist scholar Ge Hong compiled the two primary sources of information about "xingchu" Mobile Kitchens, the "Baopuzi" and "Shenxian zhuan".
Ge portrayed adepts seeking "xian"-hood as avoiding ordinary food such as grains, instead eating "rare, exotic foodstuffs from the far reaches of the cosmos", marvelous products conveying the "numinous power" suggested by their peculiarity.
"The ability to command at will a spirit-hosted serving of exotic food and drink in elegant vessels may seem trivial, but when one recalls that many Daoist scriptures prohibit the feasting on sacrificial meats and liquors enjoyed by the aristocracy, and that many adepts did their work on mountains and were isolated from agricultural communities and markets, the practice assumes a more serious aspect."
(Campany 2002: 221) 
Baopuzi.
The c. 318 CE "Inner Chapters" of the "Baopuzi" (Master Who Embraces Simplicity) have nine occurrences of the word "xingchu" (行廚, Mobile Kitchen).
Seven of them are in contexts of alchemical medicines and elixirs, most of which have poisonous toxic heavy metal ingredients.
The "Baopuzi" uses two related verbs for beckoning a Mobile Kitchen: "zhì" (至, "arrive at; reach; come") and "zhì" (致, "cause to arrive at; get to; come to").
The other two "xingchu" usages are in proper names of a Daoist amulet and book, the "Xingchu fu" (行廚符, Amulet of the Traveling Kitchen), and the "Xingchu jing" (行廚經, Scripture of the Traveling Kitchen).
The "Baopuzi" also lists another book titled "Riyue chushi jing" (日月廚食經, Scripture of the Kitchen Meals of the Sun and the Moon) (19, Ware 1966: 384, 380, 381).
Three of the seven "Baopuzi" elixirs are said to have dual purpose usages, long-term consumption is said to grant "xian" transcendence, including the ability to summon "xingchu", and short-term consumption provides a panacea—specifically for eliminating the Three Corpses or Three Worms, demons that live within the human body and hasten their host's death, and the Nine Worms or Nine Vermin, broadly meaning internal worms and parasites.
First, the "Xian Menzi dan" (羡門子丹, Master Xian Men's Elixir) is prepared from wine and cinnabar.
"After it has been taken for one day the Three Worms and all illnesses are immediately purged from the patient.
If taken for three years, it will confer geniehood and one is sure to be served by two fairies, who can be employed to summon the Traveling Canteen [可役使致行廚]."
(4, tr. Ware 1966: 84; cf. Campany 2002: 290).
Second, a list of methods for eating and drinking realgar says, "In each case it confers Fullness of Life; all illnesses are banished; the Three Corpses drop from the body; scars disappear; gray hair tums black; and lost teeth are regenerated.
After a thousand days, fairies [translating "yunu" 玉女 Jade Maiden] will come to serve you and you can use them to summon the Traveling Canteen [以致行廚]."
(11, tr. Ware 1966: 188).
Third, consuming pure, unadulterated lacquer will put a man in communication with the gods and let him Enjoy Fullness of Life.
When eaten with pieces of crab in mica or jade water, "The Nine Insects will then drop from you, and the bad blood will leave you through nose-bleeds.
After a year, the six-"chia" gods and the Traveling Canteen will come to you [一年六甲行廚至也]."
(11, tr. Ware 1966: 190).
This "liujia" (六甲, Six "Jia" Gods) and the "liuyin" (六陰, Six Yin) below refer to astrological Dunjia divination.
An alternate translation is "the six "jia" and the traveling canteen will arrive" (Campany 2002: 75), 
The remaining four "Baopuzi" formulas are said to create stronger and more versatile elixirs.
Fourth, the "Jiuguang dan" (九光丹, Ninefold Radiance Elixir) is made by processing certain unspecified ingredients with the "wushi" (五石, Five Minerals, see Cold-Food Powder), i.e., cinnabar, realgar, purified potassium alum, laminar malachite, and magnetite (Needham et al. 1976: 86).
Each mineral is put through five alchemical cycles and assumes five hues, so that altogether twenty-five hues result, each with specific powers, for example, the blue elixir will revive a recently deceased person.
"If you wish to summon the Traveling Canteen [欲致行廚], smear your left hand with a solution of black elixir; whatever you ask for will be at your beck and call, and everything you mention will arrive without effort.
You will be able to summon any thing or any creature in the world."
(tr. Ware 1966: 82–83, noting "fragrant foods served in plates of gold and cups of jade").
Fifth, the "Baopuzi" quotes from "Shennong sijing" (神農四經, Shennong's Four Classics), "Medicines of the highest type put the human body at ease and protract life so that people ascend and become gods in heaven, soar up and down in the air, and have all the spirits at their service.
Their bodies grow feathers and wings, and the Traveling Canteen comes whenever they wish [行廚立至]."
(11, tr. Ware 1966: 177).
Sixth, the method of Wu Chengzi (務成子) compounds alchemical gold from realgar, yellow sand, and mercury, and then forms it into small pills.
Coating the pills with different substances will produce magical effects, for instance, if one is smeared with ram's blood and thrown into a stream, "the fish and the dragons will come out immediately, and it will be easy to catch them."
And, "If it is coated with hare's blood and placed in a spot belonging to the Six Yin, the Traveling Canteen and the fairies will appear immediately and place themselves at your disposal [行廚玉女立至], to a total of sixty or seventy individuals."
(16, tr. Ware 1966: 276).
Seventh, Liu Gen (劉根, or Liu Jun'an 劉君安), who Ware wrongly identifies as the Daoist prince and author Liu An (劉安, Campany 2002: 248), learned the art of metamorphosis from an alchemical text attributed to the Mohist founder Mozi, the "Mozi wuxing ji" (墨子五行記, Master Mo's Records of the Five Phases), and successfully used its medicines and amulets, "By grasping a pole he becomes a tree.
He plants something, and it immediately produces edible melons or fruit.
He draws a line on the ground, and it becomes a river; he piles up dirt and it becomes a hill.
He sits down and causes the Traveling Canteen to arrive [坐致行廚]."
(19, tr. Ware 1966: 316).
Shenxian zhuan.
The c. 318 "Shenxian zhuan" (Hagiographies of Divine Transcendents) uses "xingchu" (行廚, Mobile Kitchen) six times.
The hagiography of Wang Yuan gives a detailed description of summoning a "xingchu".
Other adepts who are also said to have this ability include Li Gen, Liu Jing, Zuo Ci, Liu Zheng, and Taixuan nü (Campany 2002: 222).
First, the hagiography of Wang Yuan (王遠) and Magu (Cannabis Maiden) says Wang was a Confucianist scholar who quit his official post during the reign (146–168 CE) of Emperor Huan of Han and went into the mountains to study Daoist techniques.
Wang achieved "xian" transcendence through "shijie" "liberation by means of a simulated corpse", described with the traditional cicada metaphor, his "body disappeared; yet the cap and garments were completely undisturbed, like a cicada shell."
During his travels, Wang met the peasant Cai Jing (蔡經), whose physiognomy indicated he was destined to become a transcendent, so Wang took him on as a disciple, taught him the basic techniques, and left.
Soon afterwards Cai also used alchemical "shijie" liberation, his body became extremely hot, and his flesh and bones melted away for three days.
"Suddenly he had vanished.
When his family looked inside the blanket, only his outer skin was left, intact from head to foot, like a cicada shell."
(tr. Campany 2002: 260).
After Cai had been gone for "over a decade", he unexpectedly returned home, looking like a young man, announced to his family that Lord Wang would visit on the "seventh day of the seventh month" (later associated with the Cowherd and Weaver Girl lovers' festival), and ordered them to "prepare great quantities of food and drink to offer to his attendants."
When Wang Yuan and his heavenly entourage arrived on the auspicious "double-seven" day, he invited his old friend Magu to join their celebration because it had been over five hundred years since she had been "in the human realm."
When the Cannabis Maiden and her attendants arrived at Cai's household, 
She appeared to be a handsome woman of eighteen or nineteen; her hair was done up, and several loose strands hung down to her waist.
Her gown had a pattern of colors, but it was not woven; it shimmered, dazzling the eyes, and was indescribable – it was not of this world.
She approached and bowed to Wang, who bade her rise.
When they were both seated, they called for the travelling canteen [坐定召進行廚].
The servings were piled up on gold platters and in jade cups without limit.
There were rare delicacies, many of them made from flowers and fruits, and their fragrance permeated the air inside [Cai's home] and out.
When the meat was sliced and served, [in flavor] it resembled broiled "mo" and was announced as "kirin" meat. (tr. Campany 2002: 262)  
Compare Maspero's translation, "everyone steps forth to 'perform the Kitchen'" (1981: 291).
Guo Pu's commentary to the "Classic of Mountains and Seas" described the "mò" (貘, giant panda) as "bear-like, black and white, and metal-eating" (tr. Harper 2013: 216); and the mystical "qilin" beast is sometimes identified as a Chinese unicorn (Penny 2008: 731).
Wang Yuan then announced to the Cai family that he had brought some exceptional wine from the Tianchu (天廚, Heavenly Kitchen) asterism.
I wish to present you all with a gift of fine liquor.
This liquor has just been produced by the celestial kitchens.
Its flavor is quite strong, so it is unfit for drinking by ordinary people; in fact, in some cases it has been known to burn people's intestines.
You should mix it with water, and you should not regard this as inappropriate."
With that, he added a "dou" of water to a "sheng" of liquor, stirred it, and presented it to the members of Cai Jing's family.
On drinking little more than a "sheng" of it each, they were all intoxicated.
After a little while, the liquor was all gone. (tr. Campany 2002: 263)  
In traditional Chinese units of measurement, a "dǒu" ( 斗) was approximately equivalent to 10 liters and a "shēng" 升) approximately 1 liter.
Second, the "Shenxian zhuan" narrative of Li Gen (李根) says he studied under Wu Dawen (吳大文) and obtained a method for producing alchemical gold and silver.
Li Gen could transform himself [into other forms] and could enter water and fire [without harm].
He could sit down and cause the traveling canteen to arrive, and with it could serve twenty guests [坐致行廚能供二十人].
All the dishes were finely prepared, and all of them contained strange and marvelous foods from the four directions, not things that were locally available. (tr. Campany 2002: 219)  
Third, Liu Jing (劉京) was an official under Emperor Wen of Han (r. 180–157 BCE) who "abandoned the world and followed Lord Zhang 張君 of Handan to study the Way."
By using methods for subsisting on "efflorescence of vermilion" pills [朱英丸] and "cloud-mother [mica]" pills, Liu "lived to be one hundred thirty years old.
To look at him, one would judge him to be a person in his thirties."
He could also foretell the auspiciousness of future events. (tr. Campany 2002: 249).
The Shangqing (Supreme Purity) tradition "Han Wu Di neizhuan" (漢武帝内傳, Esoteric Traditions of Han Emperor Wu), which was written between 370 and 500, has some later accretions that resemble "Shenxian zhuan" (Campany 2002: 76).
The passage about Liu Jing says, 
Later he served Ji Zixun [薊子訓, i.e., Ji Liao 薊遼] as his teacher.
Zixun transmitted to him all the secret essentials of the Five Thearchs, Numinous Flight ("lingfei", 靈飛), the six "jia" spirits, the Twelve Matters ("shier shi" 十二事), and the Perfected Forms of the Ten Continents of Divine Transcendents (shenxian shizhou zhenxiang 神仙十洲真形).
Liu Jing practiced them all according to the instructions, and they were mightily efficacious.
He could summon ghosts and spirits, immediately cause wind and rain to arise, cause the traveling canteen to arrive [名致行廚], and appear and disappear at will.
He also knew the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of people's future affairs and of particular days. (tr. Campany 2002: 449)  
Fourth, the transcendent Zuo Ci (左慈) was a "fangshi" ("method master") famous for his abilities at divination, "fenshen" multilocation, and shapeshifting (Pregadio 2008: 1305), 
Seeing that the fortunes of the Han house were about to decline, he sighed and said, "As we move into this declining [astral] configuration, those who hold eminent offices are in peril, and those of lofty talent will die.
Winning glory in this present age is not something to be coveted."
So he studied arts of the Dao.
He understood particularly well [how to summon] the six "jia" spirits, how to dispatch ghosts and other spirits, and how to sit down and call for the traveling canteen [坐致行廚]. (tr. Campany 2002: 279)  
Fifth, the "Shenxian zhuan" says that Liu Zheng (劉政) used the same alchemical text attributed to Mozi that the "Baopuzi" says was used by Liu Gen (劉根, or Liu Jun'an 劉君安, see Campany 2002: 240–249).
Later he arranged [a copy of] Master Mo's Treatise on the Five Phases ("Mozi wuxing ji" 墨子五行記) and, [based on it], ingested "efflorescence of vermilion" pills.
He lived for more than one hundred eighty years, and his complexion was that of a youth.
He could transform himself into other shapes and conceal his form; multiply one person into a hundred or a hundred into a thousand or a thousand into ten thousand; conceal a military force of three brigades by forming them into a forest or into birds and beasts, so that they could easily take their opponents' weapons without their knowledge.
Further, he was capable of planting fruits of all types and causing them immediately to flower and ripen so as to be ready to eat.
He could sit down and cause the traveling canteen to arrive [生致行廚], setting out a complete meal for up to several hundred people.
His mere whistling could create a wind to set dust swirling and blow stones about. (tr. Campany 2002: 322)  
Transcendental whistling was an ancient Daoist yogic technique.
Sixth, the brief hagiography of the female transcendent Taixuan nü (太玄女, Woman of the Grand Mystery) says.
The Woman of the Grand Mystery was surnamed Zhuan 顓 and named He 和.
While still young, she was bereaved of her husband, so she practiced the Way.
Disciplining herself in the arts of the Jade Master, (Yuzi) she could sit down and cause the traveling canteen to arrive [坐致行廚], and there was no sort of transformation she could not accomplish. (tr. Campany 2002: 367).
In addition, the "Shenxian zhuan" hagiography for Mao Ying (茅盈) describes what sounds like a "xingchu" without using the name (Campany 2002: 328).
After twenty years studying the Dao, Mao Ying returned home to his parents and announced that he had been commanded to enter heaven and become a transcendent.
The people of his home village came to give him a going-away party, and Mao said, 
"I am touched by your sincere willingness to send me off, and I deeply appreciate your intention.
But please come empty-handed; you need not make any expenditure.
I have a means whereby to provide a feast for us all."
On the appointed day, the guests all arrived, and a great banquet was held.
Awnings of blue brocade were spread out, and layers of white felt were spread out beneath them.
Rare delicacies and strange fruits were piled up and arrayed.
Female entertainers provided music; the sounds of metal and stone mingled together, and the din shook Heaven and Earth; it could be heard from several "li" away.
Of the more than one thousand guests present that day, none failed to leave intoxicated and sated. (tr. Campany 2002: 327)  
Mao Ying and his brothers Mao Gu (茅固) and Mao Zhong (茅衷) are considered of the founders of the Shangqing School of Daoism.
Shangqing Daoists took the stock literary phrase "zuo zhi xingchu" (坐致行廚)—used above in the "Baopuzi" for Liu Gen, "sits down and causes the Traveling Canteen to arrive" (tr. Ware), and in the "Shenxian zhuan" for Li Gen, Zuo Ci, and Taixuan nü, "sit down and cause the traveling canteen to arrive" (tr. Campany)—and actualized it as a visualization technique for "making the movable cuisines come [while] sitting [in meditation]" (tr. Mollier).
"This method, accessible only to the initiate who possessed the proper series of talismans ("fu" 符) and had mastered certain visualization techniques, conferred powers to become invisible, to cause thunder, and to call for rain."
This form of sitting meditation was so popular during the Tang period that Chinese Esoteric Buddhism also adopted it.
(Mollier 2008a: 280) 
"Wuchu" Five Kitchens meditation.
Following upon the Celestial Masters liturgical Kitchen feasts and "xian" transcendents' Mobile Kitchens, the third stage of Daoist "chu" traditions was the Tang dynasty (618–907) "wǔchú" (五廚, Five Kitchens) contemplation technique, which recast the concept of ritual banquets in terms of psychophysiological "neidan" Internal Alchemy (Verellen 2004: 351).
In Chinese cosmological wuxing Five Phases correspondence theory, the "wuchu" Five Kitchens or "wuzang" (五臟, Five Viscera / Orbs) system includes not only the physiological internal organs (lungs, kidneys, liver, gallbladder, and spleen), but also the associated psychological range of mental and emotional states (Roth 1999: 41–42).
The 735 "Wuchu jing" (五廚經, Scripture of the Five Kitchens), which poetically describes a visualization practice for circulating "qi" energies through the Five Viscera, was so popular that Tang Buddhists forged the esoteric "Sānchú jīng" (三廚經, Sutra of the Three Kitchens) based on the Daoist text (Mollier 2008b: 1051).
There are two extant editions of "Wuchu jing" (translated by Kohn 2010: 198–206).
First, the 763 Tang "Daozang" (Daoist Canon) edition titled "Laozi shuo Wuchu jing zhu" (老子說五廚經, Commentary to the Scripture of the Five Kitchens as Revealed by Laozi) contains a preface dated 735 and a commentary, both signed by Yin Yin (尹愔, d. 741).
The reduplicatedly named Yin Yin was a prominent Daoist and Confucian scholar under Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (r. 712–756), and abbot of the Suming guan (肅明觀, Abbey of Reviving Light) temple in the capital Chang'an.
The late Tang Celestial Master Zhao Xianfu (趙仙甫, fl. 732) also wrote a commentary (Verellen 2004: 351).
Second, the 1019 "Yunji Qiqian" (Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel) anthology edition titled "Wuchu jing qifa" (五廚經氣法, Energetic Methods of the Scripture of the Five Kitchens), also includes Yin's commentary, with slight variations, such as noting the text was presented to the emperor in 736 (Verellen 2004: 351).
The "qi" "energetic" methods of the text are recommended by Sima Chengzhen (司馬承禎, 647–735) in his "Fuqi jingyi lun" (服氣精義論, Essay on the Essential Meaning of Breath Ingestion) text on physical self-cultivation (Mollier 2008b: 1051).
Although the presence of Yin's preface might suggest a Tang date for the "Wuchu jing", the origins of this text may be much earlier.
Ge Hong's c. 318 "Baopuzi" mentions a "Xingchu jing" (行廚經, Scripture of the Movable Kitchens) and a "Riyue chushi jing" (日月廚食經, Scripture of the Kitchen Meals for the Sun and the Moon), which could be the ancestors of the received texts (Mollier 2008b: 1051).
The c. 905 "Daojiao lingyan ji" (道教靈驗記, Record of Daoist Miracles), written by the Daoist priest, author, and court official Du Guangting, says a Buddhist monk fraudulently transformed the "Wuchu jing" Scripture of the Five Kitchens into the "Sanchu jing" (三廚經, Sutra of the Three Kitchens).
Du records that the Chinese Buddhist canon of the Tang period contained a text titled "Fo shuo san tingchu jing" (佛說三停廚經, Sutra of the Three Interrupted Kitchens, Preached by the Buddha) (Verellen I992: 248–249).
According to Du Guangting, the monk Xingduan (行端), who had "a presumptuous and fraudulent disposition", saw that the widely circulated Daoist "Wuchu jing" consisted of five stanzas ("jì" 偈, ""gatha"; poetic verse; versified utterance") of incantations ("zhòu" 咒, ""mantra"; religious incantation; mystical invocation"), rearranged them, and expanded the title into "Fo shuo san tingchu jing" (佛說三停廚經).
"The five incantations he turned into 'five sutras spoken by Tathagata,' and at the end he added a hymn.
The additional phrases amounted to no less than a page."
Verellen suggests that the scripture, with its "Buddho-Daoist content and quasi-magical use", originated as a late Six Dynasties (220–589) Tantric "zhoujing" (咒經, "incantations scripture", cf. the "Divine Incantations Scripture").
(Verellen, 1992: 250–51).
Du Guangting gives a lengthy narrative about the Daoist miracle involving supernatural retribution for Xingduan's forgery.
One day after the monk had already given several copies of the altered scripture to others, a "divine being eight or nine feet tall" and holding a sword reprimands him for the counterfeiting and brandishes his sword to strike the monk.
As Xingduan "wards off the blow with his hand, several fingers are lopped off", he begs for mercy, and the Daoist deity agrees to spare his life if he retrieves and destroys all the fakes.
Xingduan and his companions search everywhere for the texts, but can only find half of them, the remainder having already been carried abroad by Buddhist monks.
Xingduan prepares ten fresh copies of the original scripture, offers incense, repents, and burns the altered copies.
Then the divine being reappears and announces: "Having vilified the sage's text, restitution won't save you—you do not deserve to escape death", the monk falls prostrate and dies on the spot (Verellen 1992: 251).
In the present day, early copies of this apocryphal Buddhist sutra have been preserved.
Four textual versions were discovered in the Chinese Dunhuang manuscripts, two versions, dated 1099 and 1270, are kept in the Japanese Mount Kōya manuscripts.
In addition, the modern Japanese Taishō Tripiṭaka canon includes the text (Mollier 2009: 26–28).
The highly abstract "Wuchu jing" mystical poem comprises five stanzas consisting of four five-character lines each.
The "Yunqi qiqian" edition shows that the five stanzas were associated with the Five Directions of space: east (lines 1–4), south (lines 5–8), north (lines 9–12), west (lines 13–16), and center (lines 17–20) (Verellen 2004: 351).
For example, the first four lines (tr. Kohn 2010: 200–201): 
The content of the "Wuchu jing" guides adepts toward a detached mental state of non-thinking and equanimity.
The Five Kitchens refer to "neidan" Internal Alchemy ""qi"-processing on a subtle-body level", and signify the energetic, transformative power of the Five Viscera (Kohn 2010: 71).
Yin Yin's introduction says, 
As long as you dwell in the "qi" of universal oneness [一氣] and in the harmony of cosmic peace [泰和], the five organs [五臟] are abundant and full and the five spirits [五神] are still and upright.
"When the five organs are abundant, all sensory experiences are satisfied; when the five spirits are still, all cravings and desires are eliminated.
This scripture expounds on how the five organs taking in "qi" is like someone looking for food in a kitchen.
Thus, its title: "Scripture of the Five Kitchens."
(tr. Kohn 2010: 200)  
Commenting on Yin's interpretation, Du Guangting claims more explicitly that practicing this scripture will enable an adept to stop eating.
(Verellen 2004: 352) 
Techniques in the "Wuchu jing" (, "Scripture of the Five Kitchens") mainly involve visualizing the Five Viscera of the body and chanting incantations.
These methods supposedly allow the adept to obtain satisfaction and harmony, and, after some years of training, even transcendence (Mollier 2008a: 279–280).
Despite this concern with the human body, the text strongly emphasizes mental restructuring over physical practices, saying that "accumulating cultivation will not get you to detachment" and that methods of ingestion are ultimately useless.
However, reciting the scripture is beneficial, especially if combined with mental and ethical practices, so that "you will easily get the true essentials of cultivating the body-self and protecting life."
More specifically, chanting the text one hundred times and practicing the harmonization of the five "qi" allows adepts to abstain from grain and eliminate hunger (Mollier 1999: 62–63).
Many present-day Daoists consider the "Wuchu jing" as a talismanic text to be chanted for protection (Kohn 2010: 71).
Ahimsa, Cheltenham 
Ahimsa is a heritage-listed residence and meditation meeting place located at 67 Cobran Road, Cheltenham, Hornsby Shire, New South Wales, Australia.
It was designed by and built by Marie Byles during 1937.
It is also known as Ahimsa, The Hut of Happy Omen and Sentosa.
The property is owned by the National Trust of Australia (NSW).
It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 March 2002.
History.
In 1935 Marie Beuzeville Byles purchased of land on the outskirts of Cheltenham.
A few years later she designed and built a small one-bedroom house.
Perched on a large rock and built of unpainted fibro, oiled timber, random rubble and with a roof glazed terracotta the structure melds well with its bushland setting.
Except for a vegetable garden near the house, the remainder of the site was left in its native state.
Marie Byles shared with Walter Burley Griffin and his business partner and fellow architect, Eric Nicholls the objective of integrating structures with the natural landscape and vegetation.
Although there is no documented record to prove that Griffin's work influenced her, it seems highly likely that she was favorably impressed by the houses he designed for her friends and sought to incorporate some of their qualities into "Ahimsa".
Marie Byles was not an architect and, not surprisingly, her work as a designer is less accomplished than Griffin's.
Some specific differences are that he preferred flat roofs while her house has a more conventional terracotta pitched roof; Griffin experimented with prefabricated building materials where as Marie used fibro (even in the 1930s this was a very conventional material); but they shared the goal of building small scale, understated and low cost houses which fitted unobtrusively into the Australian bush.
Born in England in 1900, Byles studied law at The University of Sydney graduating in 1924 to become the first woman in NSW to practice as a solicitor.
She was a remarkable woman who was passionately involved in preserving wilderness areas.
She was a keen mountaineer and travelled to Norway, China, Canada and New Zealand in search of unclimbed peaks.
In 1938 she led an all women team in an attempt to scale a peak, Mount Sansate in Western China.
The expedition failed due to adverse weather conditions.
In Australia her determined, active nature led her to become an early lobbyist for what we now know as national parks.
Byles was one of the early members of The Sydney Bushwalker's Club and was responsible for drawing the attention of the NSW Lands Department to the wilderness area around Maitland Bay on the central coast north of Sydney.
She was appointed Trustee of Bouddi National Park and organised working bees amongst the bushwalkers to maintain the area.
The Beecroft-Cheltenham Civic Trust was established by her as a "non-progress association" which worked for the closure of roads in the area and the planting of native trees and shrubs.
She worked with the Bradley sisters (Joan and Eileen) to rid the bush of weeds around her property, and practiced organic gardening techniques all her life.
She always slept outside on an open verandah, never drove a car, and walked everywhere, usually with a rucksack.
In 1941 while on a bushwalk, where one of the members was taken ill, Byles shouldered his pack, his carriers and her own, and in consequence her feet were permanently damaged.
From that time onwards she could manage short bushwalks only, and mountain climbing became impossible.
Always interested in eastern religions, in particular the ideas of Gandhi, her disability gave her more time to research and write.
In the late 1940s she took up medication and later traveled to India and Burma to undergo instruction.
In the 1950s Byles built a hut in her garden called the Hut of Happy Omen, which she made available to meditation groups.
By this time she had adopted the most ascetic form of South East Asian Buddhism.
The name Ahimsa is derived from Gandhi's teachings and means peace or non-violence.
One night in 1966, while sleeping on her open verandah Byles was physically assaulted and sustained serious injuries including a fractured skull.
She declined to charge her assailant.
After a period of convalescence she returned to live alone on the estate still sleeping out in the open air.
Miss Byles gave up her legal practice in 1970, four years after the attack.
In 1970 Miss Byles gave the property to the National Trust of Australia, remaining in residence as Honorary Curator.
Concerned that the one-bedroom house might be too small for her successor, she developed a plan for an addition comprising a one room detached pavilion.
Marie Byles died at "Ahimsa" on 21 November 1979.
Description.
Ahimsa has an area of and is contiguous with a much larger area of bushland, Pennant Hills Park, to the north.
The vegetation is described as dry sclerophyll (hard leafed) bushland on Sydney sandstone and is typical of the flora associated with the Northern Hills District of Sydney.
The northwest, northeast and part of the southeast boundaries are delimited by unmade road reserves, Malton Road (part) and Lyne Road (also known as Cobram Road).
It is located on a small ridge, formerly and unofficially called Native Rose Ridge, on the inside of a sharp curve in a creek draining the Beecroft Cheltenham area.
This creek subsequently joins Devlins Creek.
The upper parts of "Ahimsa" are relatively flat but the groundslopes off in a series of small Hawkesbury Sandstone cliffs in a north by north-west direction to the fire trail and towards Pennant Hills Park.
There are many flat sandstone outcrops and small cliffs.
The buildings include "Ahimsa", The Hut of Happy Omen, the toilets, which were all built before the land was sold to the Trust, Sentosa, a detached bedsitter which was approved in principle in November 1975.
A carport was built onto The Hut in 1977.
"Ahimsa" is a small one-bedroom house built of unpainted fibro, oiled timber and random rubble with a pitched roof of glazed terracotta.
There is a brick fireplace in the living room and a large north-facing open verandah looking over the gully.
The Hut of Happy Omen is basically an open shed built of unpainted fibro with a roof of corrugated fibro.
At some time it has been extended to incorporate a kitchenette and a shower stall.
Sentosa is an open plan bedsitter also constructed of fibro with a skillion roof of corrugated fibro.
Marie Byles' design principles are best expressed in this quotation from her: 'No Painting whatever anywhere - Any woodwork to be treated with linseed raw oil (saves unkeep): External walls are to be fibro; Corrugated (sic) fibro (long experience has shown fiber to be lasting, with no upkeep).'
Paths were made by volunteers and Marie Byles' bushwalking friends.
Condition.
As at 27 June 2000, the physical condition was good.
Modifications and dates.
An absorption trench was constructed in 1975 to contain surface run off from properties adjacent to "Ahimsa" as the Trust was afraid that excessive run off would encourage weed growth.
One cave has been altered and an attractive two-metre high Hawkesbury Sandstone retaining wall was constructed many years ago near the path from the northern gate.
Despite her wish that no plants foreign to it, even from other parts of Australia, should be planted several native plants not indigenous to Ahimsa have been planted.
Heritage listing.

Falun Gong 
Falun Gong (, ) or Falun Dafa (; ) is a new religious movement.
Falun Gong was founded by its leader Li Hongzhi in China in the early 1990s.
Falun Gong has its global headquarters in Dragon Springs, a compound in Deerpark, New York, near the residence of Li Hongzhi.
Falun Gong administers a variety of outreach organizations in the United States and elsewhere, including the dance troupe Shen Yun.
They are known for their views against the Chinese Communist Party and their anti-evolutionary stance.
They also operate Epoch Media Group, which is known for its subsidiaries, New Tang Dynasty Television and "The Epoch Times" newspaper.
The latter has been broadly noted as a politically far-right media entity, and it has received significant attention in the United States for promoting conspiracy theories, such as QAnon and anti-vaccine misinformation, and producing advertisements for former U.S. President Donald Trump.
It has also drawn attention in Europe, promoting far-right politicians, primarily in France and Germany.
Falun Gong emerged toward the end of China's ""qigong" boom"—a period that saw a proliferation of similar practices of meditation, slow-moving energy exercises and regulated breathing.
Falun Gong combines meditation and qigong exercises with a moral philosophy.
The practice emphasizes morality and the cultivation of virtue, and identifies as a practice of the Buddhist school, though its teachings also incorporate elements drawn from Taoist traditions.
Through moral rectitude and the practice of meditation, practitioners of Falun Gong aspire to eliminate attachments, and ultimately to achieve spiritual enlightenment.
Although practice initially enjoyed support from Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials, by the mid-to-late 1990s negative coverage of Falun Gong began to appear in state-run media.
Practitioners usually responded by picketing the source involved, and controversy and tension continued to build.
The scale of protests grew until April 1999, when over 10,000 Falun Gong practitioners gathered near the central government compound in Beijing to request legal recognition and freedom from state interference.
This demonstration is widely seen as catalyzing the persecution that followed.
On 20 July 1999, the CCP leadership initiated a nationwide crackdown and multifaceted propaganda campaign directed against the practice.
It blocked Internet access to websites that mention Falun Gong, and in October 1999 it declared Falun Gong a "heretical organization" that threatened social stability.
Falun Gong practitioners in China are reportedly subject to a wide range of human rights abuses: hundreds of thousands are estimated to have been imprisoned extrajudicially, and practitioners in detention are subject to forced labor, psychiatric abuse, torture, and other coercive methods of thought reform at the hands of Chinese authorities. , human rights groups estimated that at least 2,000 Falun Gong practitioners had died within China as a result of abuse in custody.
Data from within China suggests that millions continued to practice Falun Gong there in spite of the persecution.
Outside of China, Falun Gong is practiced in over 70 countries, with estimates on the number of adherents ranging from roughly 40,000 to several hundreds of thousands.
Beliefs and practices.
Central teachings.
Falun Gong aspires to enable the practitioner to ascend spiritually through moral rectitude and the practice of a set of exercises and meditation.
The three stated tenets of the belief are truthfulness (), compassion (), and forbearance ().
These principles have been repeated by Falun Gong members to outsiders as a tactic for evading deeper inquiry, and followers have been instructed by Li to lie about the practice.
Together these principles are regarded as the fundamental nature of the cosmos, the criteria for differentiating right from wrong, and are held to be the highest manifestations of the Tao.
Adherence to and cultivation of these virtues is regarded as a fundamental part of Falun Gong practice.
In Zhuan Falun (), the foundational text published in 1995, Li Hongzhi writes "It doesn't matter how mankind's moral standard changes[...]
The nature of the cosmos doesn't change, and it is the only standard for determining who's good and who's bad.
So to be a cultivator you have to take the nature of the cosmos as your guide for improving yourself."
Practice of Falun Gong consists of two features: performance of the exercises, and the refinement of one's (moral character, temperament).
In Falun Gong's central text, Li states that "includes virtue (which is a type of matter), it includes forbearance, it includes awakening to things, it includes giving up things—giving up all the desires and all the attachments that are found in an ordinary person—and you also have to endure hardship, to name just a few things."
The elevation of one's moral character is achieved, on the one hand, by aligning one's life with truth, compassion, and tolerance; and on the other, by abandoning desires and "negative thoughts and behaviors, such as greed, profit, lust, desire, killing, fighting, theft, robbery, deception, jealousy, etc." 
Among the central concepts found in the teachings of Falun Gong is the existence of 'Virtue' () and 'Karma' ().
The former is generated through doing good deeds and suffering, while the latter is accumulated through doing wrong deeds.
A person's ratio of karma to virtue is said to determine their fortunes in this life or the next.
While virtue engenders good fortune and enables spiritual transformation, an accumulation of karma results in suffering, illness, and alienation from the nature of the universe.
Spiritual elevation is achieved through the elimination of negative karma and the accumulation of virtue.
Practitioners believe that through a process of moral cultivation, one can achieve Tao and obtain special powers and a level of divinity.
Falun Gong's teachings posit that human beings are originally and innately good—even divine—but that they descended into a realm of delusion and suffering after developing selfishness and accruing karma.
The practice holds that reincarnation exists and that different people's reincarnation processes are overseen by different gods.
To re-ascend and return to the "original, true self", Falun Gong practitioners are supposed to assimilate themselves to the qualities of truthfulness, compassion and tolerance, let go of "attachments and desires" and suffer to repay karma.
Traditional Chinese cultural thought and modernity are two focuses of Li Hongzhi's teachings.
Falun Gong echoes traditional Chinese beliefs that humans are connected to the universe through mind and body, and Li seeks to challenge "conventional mentalities", concerning the nature and genesis of the universe, time-space, and the human body.
The practice draws on East Asian mysticism and traditional Chinese medicine, criticizes the purportedly self-imposed limits of modern science, especially evolution, and views traditional Chinese science as an entirely different, yet equally valid ontological system.
Li says that he is a being who has come to help humankind from the destruction it could face as the result of rampant evil.
When asked if he was a human being, Li replied "You can think of me as a human being."
Exercises.
In addition to its moral philosophy, Falun Gong consists of four standing exercises and one sitting meditation.
The exercises are regarded as secondary to moral elevation, though are still an essential component of Falun Gong cultivation practice.
The first exercises, called "Buddha Stretching a Thousand Arms", are intended to facilitate the free flow of energy through the body and open up the meridians.
The second exercise, "Falun Standing Stance", involves holding four static poses—each of which resembles holding a wheel—for an extended period.
The objective of this exercise is to "enhances wisdom, increases strength, raises a person's level, and strengthens divine powers".
The third, "Penetrating the Cosmic Extremes", involves three sets of movements, which aim to enable the expulsion of bad energy (e.g., pathogenic or black ) and the absorption of good energy into the body.
Through practice of this exercise, the practitioner aspires to cleanse and purify the body.
The fourth exercise, "Falun Cosmic Orbit", seeks to circulate energy freely throughout the body.
Unlike the first through fourth exercises, the fifth exercise is performed in the seated lotus position.
Called "Reinforcing Supernatural Powers", it is a meditation intended to be maintained as long as possible.
Falun Gong exercises can be practiced individually or in group settings, and can be performed for varying lengths of time in accordance with the needs and abilities of the individual practitioner.
Porter writes that practitioners of Falun Gong are encouraged to read Falun Gong books and practice its exercises on a regular basis, preferably daily.
Falun Gong exercises are practiced in group settings in parks, university campuses, and other public spaces in over 70 countries worldwide, and are taught for free by volunteers.
In addition to five exercises, in 2001 another meditation activity was introduced called "sending righteous thoughts", which is intended to reduce persecution on the spiritual plane.
Discussions of supernatural skills also feature prominently within the movement, and the existence of these skills gained a level of mainstream acceptance in China's scientific community in the 1980s.
Falun Gong's teachings hold that practitioners can acquire supernatural skills through a combination of moral cultivation, meditation and exercises.
These include—but are not limited to—precognition, clairaudience, telepathy, and divine sight (via the opening of the third eye or celestial eye).
However, Falun Gong stresses that these powers can be developed only as a result of moral practice, and should not be pursued or casually displayed.
According to David Ownby, Falun Gong teaches that "pride in one's abilities, or the desire to show off, are marks of dangerous attachments", and Li warns his followers not to be distracted by the pursuit of such powers.
Social practices.
Falun Gong differentiates itself from Buddhist monastic traditions in that it places great importance on participation in the secular world.
Falun Gong practitioners are required to maintain regular jobs and family lives, to observe the laws of their respective governments, and are instructed not to distance themselves from society.
An exception is made for Buddhist Bhikkhus and Bhikkhunīs, who are permitted to continue a monastic lifestyle while practicing Falun Gong.
As part of its emphasis on ethical behavior, Falun Gong's teachings prescribe a strict personal morality for practitioners.
They are expected to do good deeds, and conduct themselves with patience and forbearance when encountering difficulties.
For instance, Li stipulates that a practitioner of Falun Gong must "not hit back when attacked, not talk back when insulted."
In addition, they must "abandon negative thoughts and behaviors", such as greed, deception, jealousy, etc.
The teachings contain injunctions against smoking and the consumption of alcohol, as these are considered addictions that are detrimental to health and mental clarity.
Practitioners of Falun Gong are forbidden to kill living things—including animals for the purpose of obtaining food—though they are not required to adopt a vegetarian diet.
In addition to these things, practitioners of Falun Gong must abandon a variety of worldly attachments and desires.
In the course of cultivation practice, the student of Falun Gong aims to relinquish the pursuit of fame, monetary gain, sentimentality, and other entanglements.
Li's teachings repeatedly emphasize the emptiness of material pursuits; although practitioners of Falun Gong are not encouraged to leave their jobs or eschew money, they are expected to give up the psychological attachments to these things.
Similarly, sexual desire and lust are treated as attachments to be discarded, but Falun Gong students are still generally expected to marry and have families.
All sexual relations outside the confines of monogamous, heterosexual marriage are regarded as immoral.
Li Hongzhi taught that homosexuality makes one "unworthy of being human", creates bad karma, and is comparable to organized crime.
He also taught that "disgusting homosexuality shows the dirty abnormal psychology of the gay who has lost his ability of reasoning".
Li additionally stated in a 1998 speech in Switzerland that the gods' "first target of annihilation would be homosexuals".
Although gay, lesbian, and bisexual people may practice Falun Gong, founder Li stated that they must "give up the bad conduct" of all same-sex sexual activity.
Falun Gong's cosmology includes the belief that different ethnicities each have a correspondence to their own heavens, and that individuals of mixed race lose some aspect of this connection.
Falun Gong doctrine counsels against participation in political or social issues.
Excessive interest in politics is viewed as an attachment to worldly power and influence, and Falun Gong aims for transcendence of such pursuits.
According to Hu Ping, "Falun Gong deals only with purifying the individual through exercise, and does not touch on social or national concerns.
It has not suggested or even intimated a model for social change.
Many religions[...] pursue social reform to some extent[...] but there is no such tendency evident in Falun Gong."
Texts.
Li Hongzhi authored the first book of Falun Gong teachings in April 1993; titled "China Falun Gong", or simply "Falun Gong", it is an introductory text that discusses , Falun Gong's relationship to Buddhism, the principles of cultivation practice, and the improvement of moral character ().
The book also provides illustrations and explanations of the exercises and meditation.
The main body of teachings is articulated in the book "Zhuan Falun", published in Chinese in January 1995.
The book is divided into nine "lectures", and was based on edited transcriptions of the talks Li gave throughout China in the preceding three years.
Falun Gong texts have since been translated into an additional 40 languages.
In addition to these central texts, Li has published several books, lectures, articles and books of poetry, which are made available on Falun Gong websites.
The Falun Gong teachings use numerous untranslated Chinese religious and philosophical terms, and make frequent allusion to characters and incidents in Chinese folk literature and concepts drawn from Chinese popular religion.
This, coupled with the literal translation style of the texts, which imitate the colloquial style of Li's speeches, can make Falun Gong scriptures difficult to approach for Westerners.
Symbols.
The main symbol of the practice is the (Dharma wheel, or in Sanskrit).
In Buddhism, the represents the completeness of the doctrine.
To "turn the wheel of dharma" () means to preach the Buddhist doctrine, and is the title of Falun Gong's main text.
Despite the invocation of Buddhist language and symbols, the law wheel as understood in Falun Gong has distinct connotations, and is held to represent the universe.
It is conceptualized by an emblem consisting of one large and four small (counter-clockwise) swastika symbols, representing the Buddha, and four small Taiji (yin-yang) symbols of the Daoist tradition.
Dharma-ending period.
Li situates his teaching of Falun Gong amidst the "Dharma-ending period" (, ), described in Buddhist scriptures as an age of moral decline when the teachings of Buddhism would need to be rectified.
The current era is described in Falun Gong's teachings as the " rectification" period (, which might also be translated as "to correct the dharma"), a time of cosmic transition and renewal.
The process of rectification is necessitated by the moral decline and degeneration of life in the universe, and in the post-1999 context, the persecution of Falun Gong by the Chinese government has come to be viewed as a tangible symptom of this moral decay.
Through the process of the rectification, life will be reordered according to the moral and spiritual quality of each, with good people being saved and ascending to higher spiritual planes, and bad ones being eliminated or cast down.
In this paradigm, Li assumes the role of rectifying the Dharma by disseminating through his moral teachings.
Some scholars, such as Maria Hsia Chang and Susan Palmer, have described Li's rhetoric about the " rectification" and providing salvation "in the final period of the Last Havoc" as apocalyptic.
However, Benjamin Penny, a professor of Chinese history at the Australian National University, argues that Li's teachings are better understood in the context of a "Buddhist notion of the cycle of the Dharma or the Buddhist law".
Richard Gunde wrote that, unlike apocalyptic groups in the West, Falun Gong does not fixate on death or the end of the world, and instead "has a simple, innocuous ethical message".
Li Hongzhi does not discuss a "time of reckoning", and has rejected predictions of an impending apocalypse in his teachings.
Categorization.
Scholars overwhelmingly describe Falun Gong as a new religious movement.
The organization is regularly featured in handbooks of new religious movements.
While commonly described by scholars as a new religious movement, adherents may reject this term.
Falun Gong is a multifaceted discipline that means different things to different people, ranging from a set of physical exercises for the attainment of better health and a praxis of self-transformation, to a moral philosophy and a new knowledge system.
In the cultural context of China, Falun Gong is generally described either as a system of qigong, or a type of "cultivation practice" ("xiulian"), a process by which an individual seeks spiritual perfection, often through both physical and moral conditioning.
Varieties of cultivation practice are found throughout Chinese history, spanning Buddhist, Daoist, and Confucian traditions.
Benjamin Penny writes "the best way to describe Falun Gong is as a cultivation system.
Cultivation systems have been a feature of Chinese life for at least 2,500 years."
Qigong practices can also be understood as a part of a broader tradition of "cultivation practice".
In the West, Falun Gong is frequently classified as a religion on the basis of its theological and moral teachings, its concerns with spiritual cultivation and transformation, and its extensive body of scripture.
Falun Gong practitioners themselves have sometimes disavowed this classification, however.
This rejection reflects the relatively narrow definition of "religion" ("zongjiao") in contemporary China.
According to David Ownby, religion in China has been defined since 1912 to refer to "world-historical faiths" that have "well-developed institutions, clergy, and textual traditions"—namely, Buddhism, Daoism, Islam, Protestantism, and Catholicism.
Moreover, if Falun Gong had described itself as a religion in China, it likely would have invited immediate suppression.
These historical and cultural circumstances notwithstanding, the practice has often been described as a form of Chinese religion.
Organization.
As a matter of doctrinal significance, Falun Gong is intended to be "formless", having little to no material or formal organization.
Practitioners of Falun Gong cannot collect money or charge fees, conduct healings, or teach or interpret doctrine for others.
There are no administrators or officials within the practice, no system of membership, and no churches or physical places of worship.
In the absence of membership or initiation rituals, Falun Gong practitioners can be anyone who chooses to identify themselves as such.
Students are free to participate in the practice and follow its teachings as much or as little as they like, and practitioners do not instruct others on what to believe or how to behave.
Spiritual authority is vested exclusively in the teachings of founder Li Hongzhi.
But organizationally Falun Gong is decentralized, and local branches and assistants are afforded no special privileges, authority, or titles.
Volunteer "assistants" or "contact persons" do not hold authority over other practitioners, regardless of how long they have practiced Falun Gong.
Li's spiritual authority within the practice is absolute, yet the organization of Falun Gong works against totalistic control, and Li does not intervene in the personal lives of practitioners.
Falun Gong practitioners have little to no contact with Li, except through the study of his teachings.
There is no hierarchy in Falun Gong to enforce orthodoxy, and little or no emphasis is given on dogmatic discipline; the only thing emphasized is the need for strict moral behavior, according to Craig Burgdoff, a professor of religious studies.
To the extent that organization is achieved in Falun Gong, it is accomplished through a global, networked, and largely virtual online community.
In particular, electronic communications, email lists and a collection of websites are the primary means of coordinating activities and disseminating Li Hongzhi's teachings.
Outside Mainland China, a network of volunteer 'contact persons', regional Falun Dafa Associations and university clubs exist in approximately 80 countries.
Li Hongzhi's teachings are principally spread through the Internet.
In most mid- to large-sized cities, Falun Gong practitioners organize regular group meditation or study sessions in which they practice Falun Gong exercises and read Li Hongzhi's writings.
The exercise and meditation sessions are described as informal groups of practitioners who gather in public parks—usually in the morning—for one to two hours.
Group study sessions typically take place in the evenings in private residences or university or high school classrooms, and are described by David Ownby as "the closest thing to a regular 'congregational experience'" that Falun Gong offers.
Individuals who are too busy, isolated, or who simply prefer solitude may elect to practice privately.
When there are expenses to be covered (such as for the rental of facilities for large-scale conferences), costs are borne by self-nominated and relatively affluent individual members of the community.
Within China.
In 1993, the Beijing-based Falun Dafa Research Society was accepted as a branch of the state-run China Qigong Research Society (CQRS), which oversaw the administration of the country's various qigong schools, and sponsored activities and seminars.
As per the requirements of the CQRS, Falun Gong was organized into a nationwide network of assistance centers, "main stations", "branches", "guidance stations", and local practice sites, mirroring the structure of the qigong society or even of the Communist Party itself.
Falun Gong assistants were self-selecting volunteers who taught the exercises, organized events, and disseminated new writings from Li Hongzhi.
The Falun Dafa Research Society provided advice to students on meditation techniques, translation services, and coordination for the practice nationwide.
Following its departure from the CQRS in 1996, Falun Gong came under increased scrutiny from authorities and responded by adopting a more decentralized and loose organizational structure.
In 1997, the Falun Dafa Research Society was formally dissolved, along with the regional "main stations".
Yet practitioners continued to organize themselves at local levels, being connected through electronic communications, interpersonal networks and group exercise sites.
Both Falun Gong sources and Chinese government sources claimed that there were some 1,900 "guidance stations" and 28,263 local Falun Gong exercise sites nationwide by 1999, though they disagree over the extent of vertical coordination among these organizational units.
In response to the persecution that began in 1999, Falun Gong was driven underground, the organizational structure grew yet more informal within China, and the internet took precedence as a means of connecting practitioners.
Following the persecution of Falun Gong in 1999, Chinese authorities sought to portray Falun Gong as a hierarchical and well-funded organization.
James Tong writes that it was in the government's interest to portray Falun Gong as highly organized in order to justify its repression of the group: "The more organized the Falun Gong could be shown to be, then the more justified the regime's repression in the name of social order was."
He concluded that Party's claims lacked "both internal and external substantiating evidence", and that despite the arrests and scrutiny, the authorities never "credibly countered Falun Gong rebuttals".
Dragon Springs compound.
Falun Gong operates out of Dragon Springs, a 400-acre compound located in Deerpark, New York.
Falun Gong founder and leader Li Hongzhi resides near the compound, along with "hundreds" of Falun Gong adherents.
Members of Falun Gong extension Shen Yun live and rehearse in the compound, which also contains schools and temples.
The compound is registered as a church, Dragon Springs Buddhist, which gives it tax exemptions and greater privacy.
Scholar Andrew Junker noted that in 2019, near Dragon Springs, in Middletown, was an office for the Falun Gong media extension "The Epoch Times", which published a special local edition.
The compound has been a point of controversy among former residents.
According to NBC News: 
[F]our former compound residents and former Falun Gong practitioners who spoke to NBC News... said that life in Dragon Springs is tightly controlled by Li, that internet access is restricted, the use of medicines is discouraged, and arranged relationships are common.
Two former residents on visas said they were offered to be set up with U.S. residents at the compound.
Tiger Huang, a former Dragon Springs resident who was on a United States student visa from Taiwan, said she was set up on three dates on the compound, and she believed her ability to stay in the United States was tied to the arrangement.
"The purpose of setting up the dates was obvious", Huang said.
Her now-husband, a former Dragon Springs resident, confirmed the account.
Huang said she was told by Dragon Springs officials her visa had expired and was told to go back to Taiwan after months of dating a nonpractitioner in the compound.
She later learned that her visa had not expired when she was told to leave the country.
Acquired by Falun Gong in 2000, the site is closed to visitors and features guarded gates, has been a point of contention for some Deer Park residents concerned.
In 2019, Falun Gong requested to expand the site, wishing to add a 920-seat concert hall, a new parking garage, a wastewater treatment plant and a conversion of meditation space into residential space large enough to bring the total residential capacity to 500 people.
These plans met with opposition from the Delaware Riverkeeper Network regarding the wastewater treatment facility and the elimination of local wetlands, impacting local waterways such as the Basher Kill and Neversink River.
Local residents opposed the expansion because it would increase traffic and reduce the rural character of the area.
Falun Gong adherents living in the area have claimed that they have experienced discrimination from local residents.
After visiting in 2019, Junker noted that "the secrecy of Dragon Springs was obvious and a source of tension for the town."
Junker adds that, Dragon Springs's website says its restricted access is for security reasons, and that the site claims the compound contains orphans and refugees .
Demography.
Prior to July 1999, official estimates placed the number of Falun Gong practitioners at 70 million nationwide, rivaling membership in the Communist Party.
By the time of the persecution on 22 July 1999, most Chinese government numbers said the population of Falun Gong was between 2 and 3 million, though some publications maintained an estimate of 40 million.
Most Falun Gong estimates in the same period placed the total number of practitioners in China at 70 to 80 million.
Other sources have estimated the Falun Gong population in China to have peaked between 10 and 70 million practitioners.
The number of Falun Gong practitioners still practicing in China today is difficult to confirm, though some sources estimate that tens of millions continue to practice privately.
Demographic surveys conducted in China in 1998 found a population that was mostly female and elderly.
Of 34,351 Falun Gong practitioners surveyed, 27% were male and 73% female.
Only 38% were under 50 years old.
Falun Gong attracted a range of other individuals, from young college students to bureaucrats, intellectuals and Party officials.
Surveys in China from the 1990s found that between 23 and 40% of practitioners held university degrees at the college or graduate level—several times higher than the general population.
Falun Gong is practiced by tens, and possibly hundreds, of thousands outside China, with the largest communities found in Taiwan and North American cities with large Chinese populations, such as New York and Toronto.
Demographic surveys by Palmer and Ownby in these communities found that 90% of practitioners are ethnic Chinese.
The average age was approximately 40.
Among survey respondents, 56% were female and 44% male; 80% were married.
The surveys found the respondents to be highly educated: 9% held PhDs, 34% had master's degrees, and 24% had a bachelor's degree.
As of 2008, the most commonly reported reasons for being attracted to Falun Gong were intellectual content, cultivation exercises, and health benefits.
Non-Chinese Falun Gong practitioners tend to fit the profile of "spiritual seekers"—people who had tried a variety of qigong, yoga, or religious practices before finding Falun Gong.
According to sociologist Richard Madsen, who specializes in studying modern Chinese culture, Chinese scientists with doctorates from prestigious American universities who practice Falun Gong claim that modern physics (for example, superstring theory) and biology (specifically the pineal gland's function) provide a scientific basis for their beliefs.
From their point of view, "Falun Dafa is knowledge rather than religion, a new form of science rather than faith".
History inside China.
1992–1996.
Li Hongzhi introduced Falun Gong to the public on 13 May 1992, in Changchun, Jilin Province.
Several months later, in September 1992, Falun Gong was admitted as a branch of qigong under the administration of the state-run China Qigong Scientific Research Society (CQRS).
Li was recognized as a qigong master, and was authorized to teach his practice nationwide.
Like many "qigong" masters at the time, Li toured major cities in China from 1992 to 1994 to teach the practice.
He was granted a number of awards by PRC governmental organizations.
According to David Ownby, Professor of History and Director of the Center for East Asian Studies at the Université de Montréal, Li became an "instant star of the qigong movement", and Falun Gong was embraced by the government as an effective means of lowering health care costs, promoting Chinese culture, and improving public morality.
In December 1992, for instance, Li and several Falun Gong students participated in the Asian Health Expo in Beijing, where he reportedly "received the most praise [of any qigong school] at the fair, and achieved very good therapeutic results", according to the fair's organizer.
The event helped cement Li's popularity, and journalistic reports of Falun Gong's healing powers spread.
In 1993, a publication of the Ministry of Public Security praised Li for "promoting the traditional crime-fighting virtues of the Chinese people, in safeguarding social order and security, and in promoting rectitude in society."
Falun Gong had differentiated itself from other "qigong" groups in its emphasis on morality, low cost, and health benefits.
It rapidly spread via word-of-mouth, attracting a wide range of practitioners from all walks of life, including numerous members of the Chinese Communist Party.
From 1992 to 1994, Li did charge fees for the seminars he was giving across China, though the fees were considerably lower than those of competing qigong practices, and the local qigong associations received a substantial share.
Li justified the fees as being necessary to cover travel costs and other expenses, and on some occasions, he donated the money earned to charitable causes.
In 1994, Li ceased charging fees altogether, thereafter stipulating that Falun Gong must always be taught for free, and its teachings made available without charge (including online).
Although some observers believe Li continued to earn substantial income through the sale of Falun Gong books, others dispute this, asserting that most Falun Gong books in circulation were bootleg copies.
With the publication of the books "Falun Gong" and "Zhuan Falun", Li made his teachings more widely accessible.
"Zhuan Falun", published in January 1995 at an unveiling ceremony held in the auditorium of the Ministry of Public Security, became a best-seller in China.
In 1995, Chinese authorities began looking to Falun Gong to solidify its organizational structure and ties to the party-state.
Li was approached by the Chinese National Sports Committee, Ministry of Public Health, and China Qigong Science Research Association (CQRS) to jointly establish a Falun Gong association.
Li declined the offer.
The same year, the CQRS issued a new regulation mandating that all qigong denominations establish a Communist Party branch.
Li again refused.
Tensions continued to mount between Li and the CQRS in 1996.
In the face of Falun Gong's rise in popularity—a large part of which was attributed to its low cost—competing "qigong" masters accused Li of undercutting them.
According to Schechter, the "qigong" society under which Li and other "qigong" masters belonged asked Li to hike his tuition, but Li emphasized the need for the teachings to be free of charge.
In March 1996, Falun Gong withdrew from the CQRS in response to mounting disagreements, after which time it operated outside the official sanction of the state.
Falun Gong representatives attempted to register with other government entities, but were rebuffed.
Li and Falun Gong were then outside the circuit of personal relations and financial exchanges through which masters and their "qigong" organizations could find a place within the state system, and also the protections this afforded.
1996–1999.
Falun Gong's departure from the state-run CQRS corresponded to a wider shift in the government's attitudes towards qigong practices.
As qigong's detractors in government grew more influential, authorities began attempting to rein in the growth and influence of these groups, some of which had amassed tens of millions of followers.
In the mid-1990s the state-run media began publishing articles critical of qigong.
Falun Gong was initially shielded from the mounting criticism, but following its withdrawal from the CQRS in March 1996, it lost this protection.
On 17 June 1996, the "Guangming Daily", an influential state-run newspaper, published a polemic against Falun Gong in which its central text, "Zhuan Falun", was described as an example of "feudal superstition".
The author wrote that the history of humanity is a "struggle between science and superstition", and called on Chinese publishers not to print "pseudo-scientific books of the swindlers".
The article was followed by at least twenty more in newspapers nationwide.
Soon after, on 24 July, the Central Propaganda Department banned all publication of Falun Gong books (though the ban was not consistently enforced).
The state-administered Buddhist Association of China also began issuing criticisms of Falun Gong, urging lay Buddhists not to take up the practice.
The events were an important challenge to Falun Gong, and one that practitioners did not take lightly.
Thousands of Falun Gong followers wrote to "Guangming Daily" and to the CQRS to complain against the measures, claiming that they violated Hu Yaobang's 1982 'Triple No' directive, which prohibited the media from either encouraging or criticizing qigong practices.
In other instances, Falun Gong practitioners staged peaceful demonstrations outside media or local government offices to request retractions of perceived unfair coverage.
The polemics against Falun Gong were part of a larger movement opposing qigong organizations in the state-run media.
Although Falun Gong was not the only target of the media criticism, nor the only group to protest, theirs was the most mobilized and steadfast response.
Many of Falun Gong's protests against negative media portrayals were successful, resulting in the retraction of several newspaper stories critical of the practice.
This contributed to practitioners' belief that the media claims against them were false or exaggerated, and that their stance was justified.
In June 1998, He Zuoxiu, an outspoken critic of qigong and a fierce defender of Marxism, appeared on a talk show on Beijing Television and openly disparaged "qigong" groups, making particular mention of Falun Gong.
Falun Gong practitioners responded with peaceful protests and by lobbying the station for a retraction.
The reporter responsible for the program was reportedly fired, and a program favorable to Falun Gong was aired several days later.
Falun Gong practitioners also mounted demonstrations at 14 other media outlets.
In 1997, The Ministry of Public Security launched an investigation into whether Falun Gong should be deemed xie jiao (, "heretical teaching").
The report concluded that "no evidence has appeared thus far".
The following year, however, on 21 July 1998, the Ministry of Public Security issued Document No. 555, "Notice of the Investigation of Falun Gong".
The document asserted that Falun Gong is a "heretical teaching", and mandated that another investigation be launched to seek evidence in support of the conclusion.
Falun Gong practitioners reported having phone lines tapped, homes ransacked and raided, and Falun Gong exercise sites disrupted by public security agents.
In this time period, even as criticism of qigong and Falun Gong mounted in some circles, the practice maintained a number of high-profile supporters in the government.
In 1998, Qiao Shi, the recently retired Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, initiated his own investigation into Falun Gong.
After months of investigations, his group concluded that "Falun Gong has hundreds of benefits for the Chinese people and China, and does not have one single bad effect."
In May of the same year, China's National Sports Commission launched its own survey of Falun Gong.
Based on interviews with over 12,000 Falun Gong practitioners in Guangdong province, they stated that they were "convinced the exercises and effects of Falun Gong are excellent.
It has done an extraordinary amount to improve society's stability and ethics."
The practice's founder, Li Hongzhi, was largely absent from the country during the period of rising tensions with the government.
In March 1995, Li had left China to first teach his practice in France and then other countries, and in 1998 obtained permanent residency in the United States.
By 1999, estimates provided by the State Sports Commission suggested there were 70 million Falun Gong practitioners in China.
An anonymous employee of China's National Sports Commission, was at this time quoted in an interview with U.S. News &amp; World Report as speculating that if 100 million had taken up Falun Gong and other forms of qigong there would be a dramatic reduction of health care costs and that "Premier Zhu Rongji is very happy about that."
Tianjin and Zhongnanhai protests.
By the late 1990s, the Communist Party's relationship to the growing Falun Gong movement had become increasingly tense.
Reports of discrimination and surveillance by the Public Security Bureau were escalating, and Falun Gong practitioners were routinely organizing sit-in demonstrations responding to media articles they deemed to be unfair.
The conflicting investigations launched by the Ministry of the Public Security on one side and the State Sports Commission and Qiao Shi on the other spoke of the disagreements among China's elites on how to regard the growing practice.
In April 1999, an article critical of Falun Gong was published in Tianjin Normal University's "Youth Reader" magazine.
The article was authored by physicist He Zuoxiu who, as Porter and Gutmann indicate, is a relative of Politburo member and public security secretary Luo Gan.
The article cast qigong, and Falun Gong in particular, as superstitious and harmful for youth.
Falun Gong practitioners responded by picketing the offices of the newspaper requesting a retraction of the article.
Unlike past instances in which Falun Gong protests were successful, on 22 April the Tianjin demonstration was broken up by the arrival of three hundred riot police.
Some of the practitioners were beaten, and forty-five arrested.
Other Falun Gong practitioners were told that if they wished to appeal further, they needed to take the issue up with the Ministry of Public Security and go to Beijing to appeal.
The Falun Gong community quickly mobilized a response, and on the morning of 25 April, upwards of 10,000 practitioners gathered near the central appeals office to demand an end to the escalating harassment against the movement, and request the release of the Tianjin practitioners.
According to Benjamin Penny, practitioners sought redress from the leadership of the country by going to them and, "albeit very quietly and politely, making it clear that they would not be treated so shabbily."
They sat or read quietly on the sidewalks surrounding the Zhongnanhai.
Five Falun Gong representatives met with Premier Zhu Rongji and other senior officials to negotiate a resolution.
The Falun Gong representatives were assured that the regime supported physical exercises for health improvements and did not consider the Falun Gong to be anti-government.
Party general secretary Jiang Zemin was alerted to the demonstration by CPC Politburo member Luo Gan, and was reportedly angered by the audacity of the demonstration—the largest since the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre.
Jiang called for resolute action to suppress the group, and reportedly criticized Premier Zhu for being "too soft" in his handling of the situation.
That evening, Jiang composed a letter indicating his desire to see Falun Gong "defeated".
In the letter, Jiang expressed concerns over the size and popularity of Falun Gong, and in particular about the large number of senior Communist Party members found among Falun Gong practitioners.
He believed it possible foreign forces were behind Falun Gong's protests (the practice's founder, Li Hongzhi, had emigrated to the United States), and expressed concern about their use of the internet to coordinate a large-scale demonstration.
Jiang also intimated that Falun Gong's moral philosophy was at odds with the atheist values of Marxist–Leninism, and therefore constituted a form of ideological competition.
Jiang is held by Falun Gong to be personally responsible for this decision to persecute Falun Gong.
Peerman cited reasons such as suspected personal jealousy of Li Hongzhi; Saich points to Jiang's anger at Falun Gong's widespread appeal, and ideological struggle as causes for the crackdown that followed.
Willy Wo-Lap Lam suggests Jiang's decision to suppress Falun Gong was related to a desire to consolidate his power within the Politburo.
According to Human Rights Watch, Communist Party leaders and ruling elite were far from unified in their support for the crackdown.
Persecution.
On 20 July 1999, security forces abducted and detained thousands of Falun Gong practitioners who they identified as leaders.
Two days later, on 22 July, the PRC Ministry of Civil Affairs outlawed the Falun Dafa Research Society as an illegal organization that was "engaged in illegal activities, advocating superstition and spreading fallacies, hoodwinking people, inciting and creating disturbances, and jeopardizing social stability".
The same day, the Ministry of Public Security issued a circular forbidding citizens from practicing Falun Gong in groups, possessing Falun Gong's teachings, displaying Falun Gong banners or symbols, or protesting against the ban.
The aim of the ensuing campaign was to "eradicate" the group through a combination of means which included the publication and distribution of propaganda which denounced it and the imprisonment and coercive thought reform of its practitioners, sometimes resulting in deaths.
In October 1999, four months after the imposition of the ban, legislation was passed in order to outlaw "heterodox religions" and sentence Falun Gong devotees to prison terms.
Hundreds of thousands of Falun Gong practitioners are estimated to have been extrajudicially imprisoned, and practitioners who are currently in detention are reportedly subjected to forced labor, psychiatric abuse, torture, and other coercive methods of thought reform at the hands of Chinese authorities.
The U.S. Department of State and Congressional-Executive Commission on China cite estimates that as much as half of China's reeducation-through-labor camp population is made up of Falun Gong practitioners.
Researcher Ethan Gutmann estimates that Falun Gong practitioners represent an average of 15 to 20 percent of the total "laogai" population, a population which includes practitioners who are currently being held in re-education through labor camps as well as practitioners who are currently being held in prisons and other forms of administrative detention.
Former detainees of the labor camp system have reported that Falun Gong practitioners comprise one of the largest groups of prisoners; in some labor camp and prison facilities, they comprise the majority of the detainees, and they are often said to receive the longest sentences and the worst treatment.
A 2013 report on labor reeducation camps by Amnesty International found that in some cases, Falun Gong practitioners "constituted on average from one third to 100 per cent of the total population" of certain camps.
According to Johnson, the campaign against Falun Gong extends to many aspects of society, including the media apparatus, the police force, the military, the education system, and workplaces.
An extra-constitutional body, the "610 Office" was created to "oversee" the effort.
Human Rights Watch (2002) commented that families and workplace employees were urged to cooperate with the government.
Causes.
Observers have attempted to explain the Party's rationale for banning Falun Gong as stemming from a variety of factors.
Many of these explanations centre on institutional causes, such as Falun Gong's size and popularity, its independence from the state, and internal politics within the Chinese Communist Party.
Other scholars have noted that Chinese authorities were troubled by Falun Gong's moral and spiritual content, which put it at odds with aspects of the official Marxist ideology.
Still others have pointed to China's history of bloody sectarian revolts as a possible factor leading to the crackdown.
Xinhua News Agency, the official news organization of the Communist Party, declared that Falun Gong is "opposed to the Communist Party of China and the central government, preaches idealism, theism and feudal superstition."
Xinhua also asserted that "the so-called 'truth, kindness and forbearance' principle preached by [Falun Gong] has nothing in common with the socialist ethical and cultural progress we are striving to achieve", and it also argued that it was necessary to crush Falun Gong in order to preserve the "vanguard role and purity" of the Communist Party.
Other articles which appeared in the state-run media in the first days and weeks after the ban was imposed posited that Falun Gong must be defeated because its "theistic" philosophy was at odds with the Marxism–Leninism paradigm and the secular values of materialism.
Willy Wo-Lap Lam writes that Jiang Zemin's campaign against Falun Gong may have been used to promote allegiance to himself; Lam quotes one party veteran as saying "by unleashing a Mao-style movement [against Falun Gong], Jiang is forcing senior cadres to pledge allegiance to his line."
"The Washington Post" reported that sources indicated not all of the standing committee of the Politburo shared Jiang's view that Falun Gong should be eradicated, 
Human Rights Watch commented that the crackdown on Falun Gong reflects historical efforts by the Chinese Communist Party to eradicate religion, which the government believes is inherently subversive.
The Chinese government protects five "patriotic", Communist Party-sanctioned religious groups.
Unregistered religions that fall outside the state-sanctioned organizations are thus vulnerable to suppression.
"The Globe and Mail" wrote: "any group that does not come under the control of the Party is a threat".
Craig S. Smith of "The Wall Street Journal" wrote that the party feels increasingly threatened by any belief system that challenges its ideology and has an ability to organize itself.
That Falun Gong, whose belief system represented a revival of traditional Chinese religion, was being practiced by a large number of Communist Party members and members of the military was seen as particularly disturbing to Jiang Zemin; according to Julia Ching, "Jiang accepts the threat of Falun Gong as an ideological one: spiritual beliefs against militant atheism and historical materialism.
He [wished] to purge the government and the military of such beliefs."
Yuezhi Zhao points to several other factors that may have led to a deterioration of the relationship between Falun Gong and the Chinese state and media.
These included infighting within China's qigong establishment, the influence of qigong opponents among Communist Party leaders, and the struggles from mid-1996 to mid-1999 between Falun Gong and the Chinese power elite over the status and treatment of the movement.
According to Zhao, Falun Gong practitioners have established a "resistance identity"—one that stands against prevailing pursuits of wealth, power, scientific rationality, and "the entire value system associated with China's project of modernization."
In China the practice represented an indigenous spiritual and moral tradition, a cultural revitalization movement, and it was a sharp contrast to "Marxism with Chinese characteristics".
Vivienne Shue similarly writes that Falun Gong presented a comprehensive challenge to the Communist Party's legitimacy.
Shue argues that Chinese rulers have historically derived their legitimacy from their claim to possess an exclusive connection to the "Truth".
In imperial China, truth was based on a Confucian and Daoist cosmology, where in the case of the Communist Party, the truth is represented by Marxist–Leninism and historical materialism.
Falun Gong challenged the Marxist–Leninism paradigm, reviving an understanding which is based on more traditionally Buddhist or Daoist conceptions.
David Ownby contends that Falun Gong also challenged the Communist Party's hegemony over the Chinese nationalist discourse: "[Falun Gong's] evocation of a different vision of Chinese tradition and its contemporary values are now so threatening to the state and the party because it denies them the sole right to define the meaning of Chinese nationalism, and it even denies them the sole right to define the meaning of Chineseness."
Maria Chang commented that since the overthrow of the Qin dynasty, "Millenarian movements had exerted a profound impact on the course of Chinese history", culminating in the Chinese Revolutions of 1949, which brought the Chinese Communists to power.
Patsy Rahn (2002) describes a paradigm of conflict between Chinese sectarian groups and the rulers who they often challenge.
According to Rahn, the history of this paradigm goes back to the collapse of the Han dynasty: "The pattern of a ruling power keeping a watchful eye on sectarian groups, at times threatened by them, at times raising campaigns against them, began as early as the second century and continued throughout the dynastic period, through the Mao era and into the present."
Conversion program.
According to James Tong, the regime aimed at both coercive dissolution of the Falun Gong denomination and "transformation" of the practitioners.
By 2000, the Party escalated its campaign by sentencing "recidivist" practitioners to "re-education through labor" in an effort to have them renounce their beliefs and "transform" their thoughts.
Terms were also arbitrarily extended by police, while some practitioners had ambiguous charges levied against them, such as "disrupting social order", "endangering national security", or "subverting the socialist system".
According to Bejesky, the majority of long-term Falun Gong detainees are processed administratively through this system instead of the criminal justice system.
Upon completion of their re-education sentences, those practitioners who refused to recant were then incarcerated in "legal education centers" set up by provincial authorities to "transform minds".
Much of the conversion program relied on Mao-style techniques of indoctrination and thought reform, where Falun Gong practitioners were organized to view anti-Falun Gong television programs and enroll in Marxism and materialism study sessions.
Traditional Marxism and materialism were the core content of the sessions.
The government-sponsored image of the conversion process emphasizes psychological persuasion and a variety of "soft-sell" techniques; this is the "ideal norm" in regime reports, according to Tong.
Falun Gong reports, on the other hand, depict "disturbing and sinister" forms of coercion against practitioners who fail to renounce their beliefs.
Among them are cases of severe beatings; psychological torment, corporal punishment and forced intense, heavy-burden hard labor and stress positions; solitary confinement in squalid conditions; "heat treatment" including burning and freezing; electric shocks delivered to sensitive parts of the body that may result in nausea, convulsions, or fainting; "devastative" forced feeding; sticking bamboo strips into fingernails; deprivation of food, sleep, and use of toilet; rape and gang rape; asphyxiation; and threat, extortion, and termination of employment and student status.
The cases appear verifiable, and the great majority identify (1) the individual practitioner, often with age, occupation, and residence; (2) the time and location that the alleged abuse took place, down to the level of the district, township, village, and often the specific jail institution; and (3) the names and ranks of the alleged perpetrators.
Many such reports include lists of the names of witnesses and descriptions of injuries, Tong says.
The publication of "persistent abusive, often brutal behavior by named individuals with their official title, place, and time of torture" suggests that there is no official will to cease and desist such activities.
Deaths.
Due to the difficulty in corroborating reports of torture deaths in China, estimates of the number of Falun Gong practitioners who have been killed as a result of the persecution vary widely.
In 2009, "The New York Times" reported that, according to human rights groups, the repressions had claimed "at least 2,000" lives.
Amnesty International said at least 100 Falun Gong practitioners had reportedly died in the 2008 calendar year, either in custody or shortly after their release.
Investigative journalist Ethan Gutmann estimated 65,000 Falun Gong were killed for their organs from 2000 to 2008 based on extensive interviews, while researchers David Kilgour and David Matas reported, "the source of 41,500 transplants for the six-year period 2000 to 2005 is unexplained".
Chinese authorities do not publish statistics on Falun Gong practitioners killed amidst the crackdown.
In individual cases, however, authorities have denied that deaths in custody were due to torture.
Organ harvesting.
In 2006, allegations emerged that a large number of Falun Gong practitioners had been killed to supply China's organ transplant industry.
These allegations prompted an investigation by former Canadian Secretary of State David Kilgour and human rights lawyer David Matas.
The Kilgour-Matas report was published in July 2006, and concluded that "the government of China and its agencies in numerous parts of the country, in particular hospitals but also detention centers and 'people's courts', since 1999 have put to death a large but unknown number of Falun Gong prisoners of conscience."
The report, which was based mainly on circumstantial evidence, called attention to the extremely short wait times for organs in China—one to two weeks for a liver compared with 32.5 months in Canada—implying it was indicative of organs being procured on demand.
It also tracked a significant increase in the number of annual organ transplants in China beginning in 1999, corresponding with the onset of the persecution of Falun Gong.
Despite very low levels of voluntary organ donation, China performs the second-highest number of transplants per year.
Kilgour and Matas also presented self-accusatory material from Chinese transplant center web sites advertising the immediate availability of organs from living donors, and transcripts of interviews in which hospitals told prospective transplant recipients that they could obtain Falun Gong organs.
In May 2008 two United Nations Special Rapporteurs reiterated requests for the Chinese authorities to respond to the allegations, and to explain a source for the organs that would account for the sudden increase in organ transplants in China since 2000.
Chinese officials have responded by denying the organ harvesting allegations, and insisting that China abides by World Health Organization principles that prohibit the sale of human organs without written consent from donors.
Responding to a U.S. House of Representatives Resolution calling for an end to abusing transplant practices against religious and ethnic minorities, a Chinese embassy spokesperson said "the so-called organ harvesting from death-row prisoners is totally a lie fabricated by Falun Gong."
In August 2009, Manfred Nowak, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture, said, "The Chinese government has yet to come clean and be transparent...
It remains to be seen how it could be possible that organ transplant surgeries in Chinese hospitals have risen massively since 1999, while there are never that many voluntary donors available."
In 2014, investigative journalist Ethan Gutmann published the result of his own investigation.
Gutmann conducted extensive interviews with former detainees in Chinese labor camps and prisons, as well as former security officers and medical professionals with knowledge of China's transplant practices.
He reported that organ harvesting from political prisoners likely began in Xinjiang province in the 1990s, and then spread nationwide.
Gutmann estimates that some 64,000 Falun Gong prisoners may have been killed for their organs between the years 2000 and 2008.
In a 2016 report, David Kilgour found that he had underestimated.
In the new report he found that the government's official estimates for the volume of organs harvested since the persecution of Falun Gong began to be 150,000 to 200,000.
Media outlets have extrapolated from this study a death toll of 1,500,000.
Ethan Gutmann estimated from this update that 60,000 to 110,000 organs are harvested in China annually observing that it is (paraphrasing): "difficult but plausible to harvest 3 organs from a single body" and also calls the harvest "a new form of genocide using the most respected members of society."
In June 2019, the China Tribunal—an independent tribunal set up by the International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China—concluded that detainees including imprisoned followers of the Falun Gong movement are still being killed for organ harvesting.
The Tribunal, chaired by Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, said it was "certain that Falun Gong as a source—probably the principal source—of organs for forced organ harvesting".
Media campaign.
The Chinese government's campaign against Falun Gong was driven by large-scale propaganda through television, newspapers, radio and internet.
The propaganda campaign focused on allegations that Falun Gong jeopardized social stability, was deceiving and dangerous, was anti-science and threatened progress, and argued that Falun Gong's moral philosophy was incompatible with a Marxist social ethic.
China scholars Daniel Wright and Joseph Fewsmith stated that for several months after Falun Gong was outlawed, China Central Television's evening news contained little but anti-Falun Gong rhetoric; the government operation was "a study in all-out demonization", they wrote.
Falun Gong was compared to "a rat crossing the street that everyone shouts out to squash" by "Beijing Daily"; other officials said it would be a "long-term, complex and serious" struggle to "eradicate" Falun Gong.
State propaganda initially used the appeal of scientific rationalism to argue that Falun Gong's worldview was in "complete opposition to science" and communism.
For example, the "People's Daily" asserted on 27 July 1999, that the fight against Falun Gong "was a struggle between theism and atheism, superstition and science, idealism and materialism."
Other editorials declared that Falun Gong's "idealism and theism" are "absolutely contradictory to the fundamental theories and principles of Marxism", and that the "'truth, kindness and forbearance' principle preached by [Falun Gong] has nothing in common with the socialist ethical and cultural progress we are striving to achieve."
Suppressing Falun Gong was presented as a necessary step to maintaining the "vanguard role" of the Communist Party in Chinese society.
Despite Party efforts, initial charges leveled against Falun Gong failed to elicit widespread popular support for the persecution of the group.
In the months following July 1999, the rhetoric in the state-run press escalated to include charges that Falun Gong was colluding with foreign, "anti-China" forces.
In October 1999, three months after the persecution began, the "People's Daily" newspaper claimed Falun Gong as a "xiejiao".
A direct translation of that term is "heretical teaching", but during the anti-Falun Gong propaganda campaign was rendered as "evil cult" in English.
In Mainland China, the term "xiejiao" has been used to target religious organizations that do not submit to Communist Party authority.""
Ian Johnson argued that applying the 'cult' label to Falun Gong effectively "cloaked the government's crackdown with the legitimacy of the West's anticult movement."
He wrote that Falun Gong does not satisfy common definitions of a cult: "its members marry outside the group, have outside friends, hold normal jobs, do not live isolated from society, do not believe that the world's end is imminent and do not give significant amounts of money to the organisation... it does not advocate violence and is at heart an apolitical, inward-oriented discipline, one aimed at cleansing oneself spiritually and improving one's health."
David Ownby similarly wrote that "the entire issue of the supposed cultic nature of Falun Gong was a red herring from the beginning, cleverly exploited by the Chinese state to blunt the appeal of Falun Gong".
According to John Powers and Meg Y. M. Lee, because the Falun Gong was categorized in the popular perception as an "apolitical, qigong exercise club", it was not seen as a threat to the government.
The most critical strategy in the Falun Gong suppression campaign, therefore, was to convince people to reclassify the Falun Gong into a number of "negatively charged religious labels", like "evil cult", "sect", or "superstition".
The group's silent protests were reclassified as creating "social disturbances".
In this process of relabelling, the government was attempting to tap into a "deep reservoir of negative feelings related to the historical role of quasi-religious cults as a destabilising force in Chinese political history."
A turning point in the propaganda campaign came on the eve of Chinese New Year on 23 January 2001, when five people attempted to set themselves ablaze on Tiananmen Square.
The official Chinese press agency, Xinhua News Agency, and other state media asserted that the self-immolators were practitioners, though the Falun Dafa Information Center disputed this, on the grounds that the movement's teachings explicitly forbid suicide and killing, further alleging that the event was "a cruel (but clever) piece of stunt-work."
The incident received international news coverage, and video footage of the burnings were broadcast later inside China by China Central Television (CCTV).
The broadcasts showed images of a 12-year-old girl, Liu Siying, burning, and interviews with the other participants in which they stated a belief that self-immolation would lead them to paradise.
But one of the CNN producers on the scene did not even see a child there.
Falun Gong sources and other commentators pointed out that the main participants' account of the incident and other aspects of the participants' behavior were inconsistent with Falun Gong's teachings.
Media Channel and the International Education Development (IED) agree that the supposed self-immolation incident was staged by CCP to "prove" that Falun Gong brainwashes its followers to commit suicide and has therefore to be banned as a threat to the nation.
IED's statement at the 53rd UN session describes China's violent assault on Falun Gong practitioners as state terrorism and that the self-immolation "was staged by the government."
"Washington Post" journalist Phillip Pan wrote that the two self-immolators who died were not actually Falun Gong practitioners.
On March 21, 2001, Liu Siying suddenly died after appearing very lively and being deemed ready to leave the hospital to go home.
"Time" reported that prior to the self-immolation incident, many Chinese had felt that Falun Gong posed no real threat, and that the state's crackdown had gone too far.
After the event, however, the mainland Chinese media campaign against Falun Gong gained significant traction.
As public sympathy for Falun Gong declined, the government began sanctioning "systematic use of violence" against the group.
In February, 2001, the month following the Tiananmen Square self-immolation incident, Jiang Zemin convened a rare Central Work Conference to stress the importance of continuity in the anti-Falun Gong campaign and unite senior party officials behind the effort.
Under Jiang's leadership, the crackdown on Falun Gong became part of the Chinese political ethos of "upholding stability"—much the same rhetoric employed by the party during 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre.
Jiang's message was echoed at the 2001 National People's Congress, where the Falun Gong's eradication was tied to China's economic progress.
Though less prominent on the national agenda, the persecution of Falun Gong has carried on after Jiang was retired; successive, high-level "strike hard" campaigns against Falun Gong were initiated in both 2008 and 2009.
In 2010, a three-year campaign was launched to renew attempts at the coercive "transformation" of Falun Gong practitioners.
In the education system.
Anti-Falun Gong propaganda efforts have also permeated the Chinese education system.
Following Jiang Zemin's 1999 ban of Falun Gong, then-Minister of Education Chen Zhili launched an active campaign to promote the Party's line on Falun Gong within all levels of academic institutions, including graduate schools, universities and colleges, middle schools, primary schools, and kindergartens.
Her efforts included a "Cultural Revolution-like pledge" in Chinese schools that required faculty members, staff, and students to publicly denounce Falun Gong.
Teachers who did not comply with Chen's program were dismissed or detained; uncooperative students were refused academic advancement, expelled from school, or sent to "transformation" camps to alter their thinking.
Chen also worked to spread the anti-Falun Gong academic propaganda movement overseas, using domestic educational funding to donate aid to foreign institutions, encouraging them to oppose Falun Gong.
Falun Gong's response to the persecution.
Falun Gong's response to the persecution in China began in July 1999 with appeals to local, provincial, and central petitioning offices in Beijing.
It soon progressed to larger demonstrations, with hundreds of Falun Gong practitioners traveling daily to Tiananmen Square to perform Falun Gong exercises or raise banners in defense of the practice.
These demonstrations were invariably broken up by security forces, and the practitioners involved were arrested—sometimes violently—and detained.
By 25 April 2000, a total of more than 30,000 practitioners had been arrested on the square; seven hundred Falun Gong followers were arrested during a demonstration in the square on 1 January 2001.
Public protests continued well into 2001.
Writing for the "Wall Street Journal", Ian Johnson wrote that "Falun Gong faithful have mustered what is arguably the most sustained challenge to authority in 50 years of Communist rule."
By late 2001, demonstrations in Tiananmen Square had become less frequent, and the practice was driven deeper underground.
As public protest fell out of favor, practitioners established underground "material sites", which would produce literature and DVDs to counter the portrayal of Falun Gong in the official media.
Practitioners then distribute these materials, often door-to-door.
Falun Gong sources estimated in 2009 that over 200,000 such sites exist across China today.
The production, possession, or distribution of these materials is frequently grounds for security agents to incarcerate or sentence Falun Gong practitioners.
In 2002, Falun Gong activists in China tapped into television broadcasts, replacing regular state-run programming with their own content.
One of the more notable instances occurred in March 2002, when Falun Gong practitioners in Changchun intercepted eight cable television networks in Jilin Province, and for nearly an hour, televised a program titled "Self-Immolation or a Staged Act?".
All six of the Falun Gong practitioners involved were captured over the next few months.
Two were killed immediately, while the other four were all dead by 2010 as a result of injuries sustained while imprisoned.
Outside China, Falun Gong practitioners established international media organizations to gain wider exposure for their cause and challenge narratives of the Chinese state-run media.
These include "The Epoch Times" newspaper, New Tang Dynasty Television, and Sound of Hope radio station.
According to Zhao, through "The Epoch Times" it can be discerned how Falun Gong is building a "de facto media alliance" with China's democracy movements in exile, as demonstrated by its frequent printing of articles by prominent overseas Chinese critics of the PRC government.
In 2004, "The Epoch Times" published a collection of nine editorials that presented a critical history of Communist Party rule.
This catalyzed the Tuidang movement, which encourages Chinese citizens to renounce their affiliations to the Chinese Communist Party, including ex post facto renunciations of the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers.
"The Epoch Times" claims that tens of millions have renounced the Communist Party as part of the movement, though these numbers have not been independently verified.
In 2006, Falun Gong practitioners in the United States formed Shen Yun Performing Arts, a dance and music company that tours internationally.
Falun Gong software developers in the United States are also responsible for the creation of several popular censorship-circumvention tools employed by internet users in China.
Falun Gong practitioners outside China have filed dozens of lawsuits against Jiang Zemin, Luo Gan, Bo Xilai, and other Chinese officials alleging genocide and crimes against humanity.
According to "International Advocates for Justice", Falun Gong has filed the largest number of human rights lawsuits in the 21st century and the charges are among the most severe international crimes defined by international criminal laws.
As of 2006, 54 civil and criminal lawsuits were under way in 33 countries.
In many instances, courts have refused to adjudicate the cases on the grounds of sovereign immunity.
In late 2009, however, separate courts in Spain and Argentina indicted Jiang Zemin and Luo Gan on charges of "crimes of humanity" and genocide, and asked for their arrest—the ruling is acknowledged to be largely symbolic and unlikely to be carried out.
The court in Spain also indicted Bo Xilai, Jia Qinglin and Wu Guanzheng.
Falun Gong practitioners and their supporters also filed a lawsuit in May 2011 against the technology company Cisco Systems, alleging that the company helped design and implement a surveillance system for the Chinese government to suppress Falun Gong.
Cisco denied customizing their technology for this purpose.
Falun Gong outside China.
Li Hongzhi began teaching Falun Gong internationally in March 1995.
His first stop was in Paris where, at the invitation of the Chinese ambassador, he held a lecture seminar at the PRC embassy.
This was followed by lectures in Sweden in May 1995.
Between 1995 and 1999, Li gave lectures in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Switzerland, and Singapore.
Falun Gong's growth outside China largely corresponded to the migration of students from Mainland China to the West in the early- to mid-1990s.
Falun Gong associations and clubs began appearing in Europe, North America and Australia, with activities centered mainly on university campuses.
Translations of Falun Gong teachings began appearing in the late 1990s.
As the practice began proliferating outside China, Li Hongzhi was beginning to receive recognition in the United States and elsewhere in the western world.
In May 1999, Li was welcomed to Toronto with greetings from the city's mayor and the provincial lieutenant governor, and in the two months that followed also received recognition from the cities of Chicago and San Jose.
Although the practice was beginning to attract an overseas constituency in the 1990s, it remained relatively unknown outside China until the Spring of 1999, when tensions between Falun Gong and Communist Party authorities became a subject of international media coverage.
With the increased attention, the practice gained a greater following outside China.
Following the launch of the Communist Party's suppression campaign against Falun Gong, the overseas presence became vital to the practice's resistance in China and its continued survival.
Falun Gong practitioners overseas have responded to the persecution in China through regular demonstrations, parades, and through the creation of media outlets, performing arts companies, and censorship-circumvention software mainly intended to reach Mainland Chinese audiences.
International reception.
Since 1999, numerous Western governments and human rights organizations have expressed condemnation of the Chinese government's suppression of Falun Gong.
Since 1999, members of the United States Congress have made public pronouncements and introduced several resolutions in support of Falun Gong.
In 2010, U.S. House of Representatives Resolution 605 called for "an immediate end to the campaign to persecute, intimidate, imprison, and torture Falun Gong practitioners", condemned the Chinese authorities' efforts to distribute "false propaganda" about the practice worldwide, and expressed sympathy to persecuted Falun Gong practitioners and their families.
Adam Frank writes that in reporting on the Falun Gong, the Western tradition of casting the Chinese as "exotic" took dominance, and that while the facts were generally correct in Western media coverage, "the normalcy that millions of Chinese practitioners associated with the practice had all but disappeared."
David Ownby wrote that alongside these tactics, the "cult" label applied to Falun Gong by the Chinese authorities never entirely went away in the minds of some Westerners, and the stigma still plays a role in wary public perceptions of Falun Gong.
To counter the support of Falun Gong in the West, the Chinese government expanded their efforts against the group internationally.
This included visits to newspaper officers by diplomats to "extol the virtues of Communist China and the evils of Falun Gong", linking support for Falun Gong with "jeopardizing trade relations", and sending letters to local politicians telling them to withdraw support for the practice.
According to Perry Link, pressure on Western institutions also takes more subtle forms, including academic self-censorship, whereby research on Falun Gong could result in a denial of visa for fieldwork in China; or exclusion and discrimination from business and community groups who have connections with China and fear angering the Communist Party.
Although the persecution of Falun Gong has drawn considerable condemnation outside China, some observers assert that Falun Gong has failed to attract the level of sympathy and sustained attention afforded to other Chinese dissident groups.
Katrina Lantos Swett, vice chair of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, has said most Americans are aware of the suppression of "Tibetan Buddhists and unregistered Christian groups or pro-democracy and free speech advocates such as Liu Xiaobo and Ai Weiwei", and yet "know little to nothing about China's assault on the Falun Gong".
Ethan Gutmann, a journalist reporting on China since the early 1990s, has attempted to explain this apparent dearth of public sympathy for Falun Gong as stemming, in part, from the group's shortcomings in public relations.
Unlike the democracy activists or Tibetans, who have found a comfortable place in Western perceptions, "Falun Gong marched to a distinctly Chinese drum", Gutmann writes.
Moreover, practitioners' attempts at getting their message across carried some of the uncouthness of Communist party culture, including a perception that practitioners tended to exaggerate, create "torture tableaux straight out of a Cultural Revolution opera", or "spout slogans rather than facts".
This is coupled with a general doubtfulness in the West of persecuted refugees.
Gutmann also says that media organizations and human rights groups also self-censor on the topic, given the PRC governments vehement attitude toward the practice, and the potential repercussions that may follow for making overt representations on Falun Gong's behalf.
Richard Madsen writes that Falun Gong lacks robust backing from the American constituencies that usually support religious freedom.
For instance, Falun Gong's conservative moral beliefs have alienated some liberal constituencies in the West (e.g. its teachings against promiscuity and homosexual behavior).
Christian conservatives, by contrast, do not accord the practice the same space as persecuted Chinese Christians.
Madsen charges that the American political center does not want to push the human rights issue so hard that it would disrupt commercial and political relations with China.
Thus, Falun Gong practitioners have largely had to rely on their own resources in responding to suppression.
In August 2007, the newly reestablished Rabbinic Sanhedrin deliberated persecution of the movement by the Chinese government at the request of Falun Gong.
"The Epoch Times" and Shen Yun.
The performance arts group Shen Yun and the media organization "The Epoch Times" are the major outreach organizations of Falun Gong.
Both promote the spiritual and political teachings of Falun Gong.
They and a variety of other organizations such as New Tang Dynasty Television (NTD) operate as extensions of Falun Gong.
These extensions promote the new religious movement and its teachings.
In the case of "The Epoch Times", they also promote conspiracy theories such as QAnon and anti-vaccine misinformation and far-right politics in both Europe and the United States.
Around the time of the 2016 United States presidential election, "The Epoch Times" began running articles supportive of Donald Trump and critical of his opponents.
Falun Gong extensions have also been active in promoting the European Radical right.
The exact financial and structural connections between Falun Gong, Shen Yun and "The Epoch Times" remains unclear.
According to NBC News: 
The Epoch Media Group, along with Shen Yun, a dance troupe known for its ubiquitous advertising and unsettling performances, make up the outreach effort of Falun Gong, a relatively new spiritual practice that combines ancient Chinese meditative exercises, mysticism and often ultraconservative cultural worldviews.
Falun Gong's founder has referred to Epoch Media Group as "our media", and the group's practice heavily informs "The Epoch Times" coverage, according to former employees who spoke with NBC News.
"The Epoch Times", digital production company NTD and the heavily advertised dance troupe Shen Yun make up the nonprofit network that Li calls "our media."
Financial documents paint a complicated picture of more than a dozen technically separate organizations that appear to share missions, money and executives.
Though the source of their revenue is unclear, the most recent financial records from each organization paint a picture of an overall business thriving in the Trump era.
ThetaHealing 
ThetaHealing (also Theta Healing) is the registered trademark for a method of meditation created by Vianna Stibal in 1995.
ThetaHealing claims to change a practitioner's brain wave pattern to the theta pattern, allowing them to explore how "emotional energy" affects their health, and develop "natural intuition".
ThetaHealing is considered a pseudoscientific practice.
Process.
ThetaHealing is usually administered in the form of individual sessions in which the practitioner sits directly opposite the person, and initially attends to the person by listening and using probing questions.
They may conduct a session long-distance through telephone or over the internet via webcam and voice.
The ThetaHealing technique is based on the idea that the beliefs in a person's conscious and unconscious mind directly impact their emotional well-being, which may impact their physical health.
The ThetaHealing technique is always taught to be used in conjunction with conventional medicine.
Its website claims that practitioners and instructors of the technique are found all over the globe.
Philosophy.
ThetaHealing's philosophy is what Vianna Stibal, an American naturopath, calls "the seven planes of existence".
According to her, these levels of existence build a framework to show the importance of the "Creator of all that is” (whose upper level is also described as the "Place of perfect love").
In addition, practitioners and instructors of the technique are open to everyone, regardless of the person's origin or religion.
Stibal states that she has "facilitated her own instant healing from cancer", that ThetaHealing can reduce HIV, and that she believes it can make an amputated leg grow back.
Criticism.
The philosophy of ThetaHealing has been criticized due to its esoteric and faith-based nature as well as an overwhelming lack of evidence of the effectiveness of the methods.
The ThetaHealing method has also been criticized as "criminal" and "not supported by any kind of evidence" by Edzard Ernst.
The McGill University Office for Science and Society pointed out that ThetaHealing did not increase theta wave activity, but that "It did the exact opposite.
Theta activity overall went down".
ThetaHealing often employs the method of applied kinesiology, after putting patients into a deep meditation.
Even the practice of applied kinesiology has been highly criticized and studies have shown that it lacks clinical value.
ThetaHealing also has been widely criticized as being motivated by money, not wellness.
In order to enroll in a ThetaHealing course that teaches how "money is an illusion", you must pay a total of seven hundred and fifty dollars.
Other ThetaHealing courses include classes which teach how to "activate the 12 strands of DNA within each participant", despite the fact that DNA is not separated into 12 strands.
Mindfulness 
Mindfulness is the practice of purposely bringing one's attention to the present-moment experience without evaluation, a skill one develops through meditation or other training.
Mindfulness derives from "sati", a significant element of Hindu and Buddhist traditions, and is based on Zen, "Vipassanā", and Tibetan meditation techniques.
Though definitions and techniques of mindfulness are wide-ranging, Buddhist traditions explain what constitutes mindfulness such as how past, present and future moments arise and cease as momentary sense impressions and mental phenomena.
Individuals who have contributed to the popularity of mindfulness in the modern Western context include Thích Nhất Hạnh, Herbert Benson, Jon Kabat-Zinn, Richard J. Davidson, and Sam Harris.
Clinical psychology and psychiatry since the 1970s have developed a number of therapeutic applications based on mindfulness for helping people experiencing a variety of psychological conditions.
Mindfulness practice has been employed to reduce depression, stress, anxiety, and in the treatment of drug addiction.
Programs based on mindfulness models have been adopted within schools, prisons, hospitals, veterans' centers, and other environments, and mindfulness programs have been applied for additional outcomes such as for healthy aging, weight management, athletic performance, helping children with special needs, and as an intervention during the perinatal period.
Clinical studies have documented both physical- and mental-health benefits of mindfulness in different patient categories as well as in healthy adults and children.
Studies have shown a positive relationship between trait mindfulness (which can be cultivated through the practice of mindfulness-based interventions) and psychological health.
The practice of mindfulness appears to provide therapeutic benefits to people with psychiatric disorders, including moderate benefits to those with psychosis.
Studies also indicate that rumination and worry contribute to a variety of mental disorders, and that mindfulness-based interventions can enhance trait mindfulness and reduce both rumination and worry.
Further, the practice of mindfulness may be a preventive strategy to halt the development of mental-health problems.
However, according to one opinion article, too much mindfulness may produce negative effects.
Evidence suggests that engaging in mindfulness meditation may influence physical health.
For example, the psychological habit of repeatedly dwelling on stressful thoughts appears to intensify the physiological effects of the stressor (as a result of the continual activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis) with the potential to lead to physical health related clinical manifestations.
Studies indicate that mindfulness meditation, which brings about reductions in rumination, may alter these biological clinical pathways.
Further, research indicates that mindfulness may favorably influence the immune system as well as inflammation, which can consequently impact physical health, especially considering that inflammation has been linked to the development of several chronic health conditions.
Other studies support these findings.
Additionally, mindfulness appears to bring about lowered activity of the default mode network of the brain, and thereby contribute towards a lowered risk of developing conditions such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
However, critics have questioned both the commercialization and the over-marketing of mindfulness for health benefits—as well as emphasizing the need for more randomized controlled studies, for more methodological details in reported studies and for the use of larger sample-sizes.
While mindfulness-based interventions may be effective for youth, research still needs to determine the most appropriate methods in which mindfulness could be introduced and delivered in schools.
Practice.
Mindfulness practice involves the process of developing the skill of bringing one's attention to whatever is happening in the present moment.
Watching the breath, body-scan and other techniques.
There are several exercises designed to develop mindfulness meditation, which may be aided by guided meditations "to get the hang of it".
As forms of self-observation and interoception, these methods increase awareness of the body, so they are usually beneficial to people with low self-awareness or low awareness of their bodies or emotional state, and can provoke anxiety, distress, flashbacks, pain, and even trigger substance abuse in people who are very focused on themselves, their bodies, and their emotions.
Timings.
Meditators are recommended to start with short periods of 10 minutes or so of meditation practice per day.
As one practices regularly, it becomes easier to keep the attention focused on breathing.
An old Zen saying suggests, "You should sit in meditation for 20 minutes every day — unless you're too busy.
Then you should sit for an hour."
In Buddhist context; moral precepts.
In a Buddhist context the keeping of moral precepts is an essential preparatory stage for mindfulness or meditation.
Vipassana also includes contemplation and reflection on phenomena as dukkha, anatta and anicca, and reflections on causation and other Buddhist teachings.
Translations.
Mindfulness meditation is part of Buddhist psychological traditions and the developing scholarship within empirical psychology.
Sati and smṛti.
The Buddhist term translated into English as "mindfulness" originates in the Pali term "sati" and in its Sanskrit counterpart "smṛti".
It is often translated as "bare attention", but in the Buddhist tradition it has a broader meaning and application, and the meaning of these terms has been the topic of extensive debate and discussion.
According to Bryan Levman, "the word "sati" incorporates the meaning of 'memory' and 'remembrance' in much of its usage in both the "suttas" and the [traditional Buddhist] commentary, and ... without the memory component, the notion of mindfulness cannot be properly understood or applied, as mindfulness requires memory for its effectiveness".
According to Robert Sharf, "smṛti" originally meant "to remember", "to recollect", "to bear in mind", as in the Vedic tradition of remembering the sacred texts.
The term "sati" also means "to remember".
In the "Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta" the term "sati" means to remember the dharmas, whereby the true nature of phenomena can be seen.
Sharf refers to the Milindapañha, which explained that the arising of "sati" calls to mind the wholesome dhammas such as the four foundations of mindfulness, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening-factors, the noble eightfold path, and the attainment of insight.
According to Rupert Gethin,  
Sharf further notes that this has little to do with "bare attention", the popular contemporary interpretation of "sati", "since it entails, among other things, the proper discrimination of the moral valence of phenomena as they arise."
Georges Dreyfus has also expressed unease with the definition of mindfulness as "bare attention" or "nonelaborative, nonjudgmental, present-centered awareness", stressing that mindfulness in a Buddhist context also means "remembering", which indicates that the function of mindfulness also includes the retention of information.
Robert H. Sharf notes that Buddhist practice is aimed at the attainment of "correct view", not just "bare attention".
Jay L. Garfield, quoting Shantideva and other sources, stresses that mindfulness is constituted by the union of two functions, "calling to mind" and vigilantly "retaining in mind".
He demonstrates that there is a direct connection between the practice of mindfulness and the cultivation of moralityat least in the context of Buddhism, from which modern interpretations of mindfulness are stemming.
Translation.
The Pali-language scholar Thomas William Rhys Davids (1843–1922) first translated "sati" in 1881 as English "" in "sammā-sati" "Right Mindfulness; the active, watchful mind".
Noting that Daniel John Gogerly (1845) initially rendered "sammā-sati" as "correct meditation", Davids explained:  
Alternative translations.
John D. Dunne asserts that the translation of "sati" and "smṛti" as mindfulness is confusing.
A number of Buddhist scholars have started trying to establish "retention" as the preferred alternative.
Bhikkhu Bodhi also points to the meaning of "sati" as "memory".
The terms "sati"/"smṛti" have been translated as: 
Definitions.
Psychology.
A.M. Hayes and G. Feldman have highlighted that mindfulness can be seen as a strategy that stands in contrast to a strategy of avoidance of emotion on the one hand and to the strategy of emotional over-engagement on the other hand.
Mindfulness can also be viewed as a means to develop self-knowledge and wisdom.
Trait, state and practice.
According to Brown, Ryan, and Creswell, definitions of mindfulness are typically selectively interpreted based on who is studying it and how it is applied.
Some have viewed mindfulness as a mental state, while others have viewed it as a set of skills and techniques.
A distinction can also be made between the "state" of mindfulness and the "trait" of mindfulness.
According to David S. Black, whereas "mindfulness" originally was associated with esoteric beliefs and religion, and "a capacity attainable only by certain people", scientific researchers have translated the term into measurable terms, providing a valid operational definition of mindfulness.
Black mentions three possible domains: 
Trait-like constructs.
According to Brown, mindfulness is: 
Several mindfulness measures have been developed which are based on self-reporting of trait-like constructs: 
State-like phenomenon.
According to Bishop, et alia, mindfulness is, "A kind of nonelaborative, nonjudgmental, present-centered awareness in which each thought, feeling, or sensation that arises in the attentional field is acknowledged and accepted as it is."
Mindfulness-practice.
Mindfulness as a practice is described as: 
According to Steven F. Hick, mindfulness practice involves both formal and informal meditation practices, and nonmeditation-based exercises.
Formal mindfulness, or meditation, is the practice of sustaining attention on body, breath or sensations, or whatever arises in each moment.
Informal mindfulness is the application of mindful attention in everyday life.
Nonmeditation-based exercises are specifically used in dialectical behavior therapy and in acceptance and commitment therapy.
Definitions arising in modern teaching of meditation.
Since the 1970s, most books on meditation use definitions of mindfulness similar to Jon Kabat-Zinn's definition as "present moment awareness".
However, recently a number of teachers of meditation have proposed quite different definitions of mindfulness.
Shinzen Young says a person is mindful when they have mindful awareness, and defines that to be when "concentration power, sensory clarity, and equanimity [are] working together."
John Yates (Culadasa) defines mindfulness to be "the optimal interaction between attention and peripheral awareness", where he distinguishes attention and peripheral awareness as two distinct modes in which one may be conscious of things.
Buddhism.
According to American Buddhist monk Ven Bhante Vimalaramsi's book "A Guide to Tranquil Wisdom Insight Meditation", the term mindfulness is often interpreted differently than what was originally formulated by the Buddha.
In the context of Buddhism, he offers the following definition: 
Other uses.
The English term "mindfulness" already existed before it came to be used in a (western) Buddhist context.
It was first recorded as "myndfulness" in 1530 (John Palsgrave translates French "pensée"), as "mindfulnesse" in 1561, and "mindfulness" in 1817.
Morphologically earlier terms include "mindful" (first recorded in 1340), "mindfully" (1382), and the obsolete "mindiness" (c. 1200).
According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, mindfulness may also refer to "a state of being aware".
Synonyms for this "state of being aware" are wakefulness, attention, alertness, prudence, conscientiousness, awareness, consciousness, and observation.
Models and frameworks for mindfulness practices.
Two-component model.
A two-component model of mindfulness based upon a consensus among clinical psychologists has been proposed as an operational and testable definition, :  
In this two-component model, self-regulated attention (the first component) "involves bringing awareness to current experience—observing and attending to the changing fields of "objects" (thoughts, feelings, sensations), from moment to moment – by regulating the focus of attention".
Orientation to experience (the second component) involves maintaining an attitude of curiosity about objects experienced at each moment, and about where and how the mind wanders when it drifts from the selected focus of attention.
Clients are asked to avoid trying to produce a particular state (e.g. relaxation), but rather to just notice each object that arises in the stream of consciousness.
The five-aggregate model.
An ancient model of the mind, generally known as the five-aggregate model enables one to understand the moment-to-moment manifestation of subjective conscious experience, and therefore can be a potentially useful theoretical resource to guide mindfulness interventions.
This model is based upon the traditional buddhist description of the Skandhas.
The five aggregates are described as follows: 
This model describes how sensory consciousness results in the generation of feelings, perception or volition, and how individuals' previously conditioned attitudes and past associations influence this generation.
The five aggregates are described as constantly arising and ceasing in the present moment.
Cultivating self-knowledge and wisdom.
The practice of mindfulness can be utilized to gradually develop self-knowledge and wisdom.
In this regard, Buddhist teachings provide detailed instructions on how one can carry out an inquiry into the nature of the mind, and this guidance can help one to make sense of one's subjective experience.
This could include understanding what the "present moment" is, how various thoughts, etc., arise following input from the senses, the conditioned nature of thoughts, and other realizations.
In Buddhist teachings, ultimate wisdom refers to gaining deep insight into all phenomena or "seeing things as they are."
Historical development.
Buddhism.
Mindfulness as a modern, Western practice is founded on Zen and modern Vipassanā, and involves the training of sati, which means "moment to moment awareness of present events", but also "remembering to be aware of something".
Early Buddhism.
"Sati" is one of the seven factors of enlightenment.
"Correct" or "right" mindfulness (Pali: "sammā-sati", Sanskrit "samyak-smṛti") is the seventh element of the Noble Eightfold Path.
Mindfulness is an antidote to delusion and is considered as a 'power' (Pali: "bala") which contributes to the attainment of "Nibbana".
This faculty becomes a power in particular when it is coupled with clear comprehension of whatever is taking place.
Nirvana is a state of being in which greed, hatred and delusion (Pali: "moha") have been overcome and abandoned, and are absent from the mind.
According to Paul Williams, referring to Erich Frauwallner, mindfulness provided the way in Early Buddhism to liberation, "constantly watching sensory experience in order to prevent the arising of cravings which would power future experience into rebirths."
According to Vetter, "Jhanas" may have been the original core practice of the Buddha, which aided the maintenance of mindfulness.
According to Thomas William Rhys Davids, the doctrine of mindfulness is "perhaps the most important" after the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path. T.W. Rhys Davids viewed the teachings of Gotama Buddha as a rational technique for self-actualization and rejected a few parts of it, mainly the doctrine of rebirth, as residual superstitions.
Zazen.
The aim of zazen is just sitting, that is, suspending all judgmental thinking and letting words, ideas, images and thoughts pass by without getting involved in them.
Contemporary "Vipassana"-meditation.
In modern "vipassana"-meditation, as propagated by the Vipassana movement, "sati" aids "vipassana", insight into the true nature of reality, namely the three marks of existence, the impermanence of and the suffering of every conditioned thing that exists, and non-self.
With this insight, the practitioner becomes a so-called "Sotāpanna", a "stream-enterer", the first stage on the path to liberation.
Vipassana is practiced in tandem with Samatha, and also plays a central role in other Buddhist traditions.
According to the contemporary Theravada orthodoxy, Samatha is used as a preparation for Vipassanā, pacifying the mind and strengthening the concentration in order to allow the work of insight, which leads to liberation.
Vipassanā-meditation has gained popularity in the west through the modern Buddhist vipassana movement, modeled after Theravāda Buddhism meditation practices, which employs vipassanā and ānāpāna meditation as its primary techniques and places emphasis on the teachings of the Sutta.
Anapanasati, satipaṭṭhāna, and vipassana.
Anapanasati is mindfulness of breathing.
"Sati" means mindfulness; "ānāpāna" refers to inhalation and exhalation.
Anapanasati means to feel the sensations caused by the movements of the breath in the body.
The "Anapanasati Sutta" gives an exposition on this practice.
Satipaṭṭhāna is the establishment of mindfulness in one's day-to-day life, maintaining as much as possible a calm awareness of one's body, feelings, mind, and dhammas.
The practice of mindfulness supports analysis resulting in the arising of wisdom (Pali: "paññā", Sanskrit: "prajñā").
"Samprajaña", "apramāda" and "atappa".
In contemporary Theravada practice, "mindfulness" also includes "samprajaña", meaning "clear comprehension" and "apramāda" meaning "vigilance".
All three terms are sometimes (confusingly) translated as "mindfulness", but they all have specific shades of meaning.
In a publicly available correspondence between Bhikkhu Bodhi and B. Alan Wallace, Bodhi has described Ven. Nyanaponika Thera's views on "right mindfulness" and sampajañña as follows: 
Monitoring mental processes.
According to Buddhadasa, the aim of mindfulness is to stop the arising of disturbing thoughts and emotions, which arise from sense-contact.
According to Grzegorz Polak, the four "upassanā" (foundations of mindfulness) have been misunderstood by the developing Buddhist tradition, including Theravada, to refer to four different foundations.
According to Polak, the four "upassanā" do not refer to four different foundations, but to the awareness of four different aspects of raising mindfulness: 
Stoicism.
The Greek philosophical school of Stoicism founded by Zeno of Citium included practices resembling those of mindfulness, such as visualization exercises.
In his "Discourses", Stoic philosopher Epictetus addresses in particular the concept of attention ("prosoche"), an idea also found in Seneca and Marcus Aurelius.
By cultivating it over time, this skill would prevent the practitioner of becoming unattentive and moved by instinct rather than according to reason.
Christianity.
Mindfulness traditions are also found in some Christian spiritual traditions.
In his Rules for Eating, St. Ignatius of Loyola teaches, "let him guard against all his soul being intent on what he is eating, and in eating let him not go hurriedly, through appetite, but be master of himself, as well in the manner of eating as in the quantity which he eats."
He might have been inspired by Epictetus' "Enchiridion".
Transcendentalism.
Mindfulness practitioner Jon Kabat-Zinn refers to Thoreau as a predecessor of the interest in mindfulness, together with other eminent Transcendentalists such as Emerson and Whitman: 
The forms of Asian religion and spirituality which were introduced in the west were themselves influenced by Transcendentalism and other 19th-century manifestations of Western esotericism.
Transcendentalism was closely connected to the Unitarian Church, which in India collaborated with Ram Mohan Roy (1772–1833) and his Brahmo Samaj.
He found that Unitarianism came closest to true Christianity, and had a strong sympathy for the Unitarians.
This influence worked through on Vivekananda, whose modern but idiosyncratic interpretation of Hinduism became widely popular in the west.
Vipassana meditation, presented as a centuries-old meditation system, was a 19th-century reinvention, which gained popularity in south-east due to the accessibility of the Buddhist sutras through English translations from the Pali Text Society.
It was brought to western attention in the 19th century by the Theosophical Society.
Zen Buddhism first gained popularity in the west through the writings of D.T. Suzuki, who attempted to present a modern interpretation of Zen, adjusted to western tastes.
Jon Kabat-Zinn and MBSR.
In 1979, Jon Kabat-Zinn founded the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program at the University of Massachusetts to treat the chronically ill.
This program sparked the application of mindfulness ideas and practices in Medicine for the treatment of a variety of conditions in both healthy and unhealthy people.
MBSR and similar programs are now widely applied in schools, prisons, hospitals, veterans centers, and other environments.
Mindfulness practices were inspired mainly by teachings from the Eastern World, particularly from Buddhist traditions.
Kabat-Zinn was first introduced to meditation by Philip Kapleau, a Zen missionary who came to speak at MIT where Kabat-Zinn was a student.
Kabat-Zinn went on to study meditation with other Zen-Buddhist teachers such as Thích Nhất Hạnh and Seungsahn.
He also studied at the Insight Meditation Society and eventually taught there.
One of MBSR's techniques—the "body scan"—was derived from a meditation practice ("sweeping") of the Burmese U Ba Khin tradition, as taught by S. N. Goenka in his Vipassana retreats, which he began in 1976.
The body scan method has since been widely adapted to secular settings, independent of religious or cultural contexts.
Kabat-Zinn was also influenced by the book "The Varieties of Religious Experience" by William James which suggests that religions point toward the same experience, and which 1960s counterculture figures interpreted as meaning that the same universal, experiential truth could be reached in different ways, including via non-religious activities.
Popularization, "mindfulness movement".
Mindfulness is gaining a growing popularity as a practice in daily life, apart from Buddhist insight meditation and its application in clinical psychology.
In this context mindfulness is defined as moment-by-moment awareness of thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, and surrounding environment, characterized mainly by "acceptance"—attention to thoughts and feelings without judging whether they are right or wrong.
Mindfulness focuses the human brain on what is being sensed at each moment, instead of on its normal rumination on the past or the future.
"Mindfulness" may be seen as a mode of being, and can be practiced outside a formal setting.
The terminology used by scholars of religion, scientists, journalists, and popular media writers to describe this movement of mindfulness "popularization," and the many new contexts of mindfulness practice which have cropped up, has regularly evolved over the past 20 years, with some criticisms arising.
The latest changes when people moved from real-life meditation sessions to the applications on their smart devices has been even more accelerated by the global pandemic.
Modern applications like are adapting to the needs of their users by using AI technology, involving professional psychologists and offering many different mindfulness approaches to serve a wider audience.
Applications.
According to Jon Kabat-Zinn the practice of mindfulness may be beneficial to many people in Western society who might be unwilling to adopt Buddhist traditions or vocabulary.
Western researchers and clinicians who have introduced mindfulness practice into mental health treatment programs usually teach these skills independently of the religious and cultural traditions of their origins.
Programs based on MBSR and similar models have been widely adopted in schools, prisons, hospitals, veterans centers, and other environments.
Therapy programs.
Mindfulness-based stress reduction.
Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a mindfulness-based program developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, which uses a combination of mindfulness meditation, body awareness, and yoga to help people become more mindful.
While MBSR has its roots in spiritual teachings, the program itself is secular.
Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy.
Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a psychological therapy designed to aid in preventing the relapse of depression, specifically in individuals with Major depressive disorder (MDD).
It uses traditional cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) methods and adds in newer psychological strategies such as mindfulness and mindfulness meditation.
Cognitive methods can include educating the participant about depression.
Mindfulness and mindfulness meditation focus on becoming aware of all incoming thoughts and feelings and accepting them, but not attaching or reacting to them.
Like CBT, MBCT functions on the theory that when individuals who have historically had depression become distressed, they return to automatic cognitive processes that can trigger a depressive episode.
The goal of MBCT is to interrupt these automatic processes and teach the participants to focus less on reacting to incoming stimuli, and instead accepting and observing them without judgment.
This mindfulness practice allows the participant to notice when automatic processes are occurring and to alter their reaction to be more of a reflection.
Research supports the effects of MBCT in people who have been depressed three or more times and demonstrates reduced relapse rates by 50%.
Mindfulness-based pain management.
Mindfulness-based pain management (MBPM) is a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) providing specific applications for people living with chronic pain and illness.
Adapting the core concepts and practices of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), MBPM includes a distinctive emphasis on the practice of 'loving-kindness', and has been seen as sensitive to concerns about removing mindfulness teaching from its original ethical framework.
It was developed by Vidyamala Burch and is delivered through the programs of Breathworks.
It has been subject to a range of clinical studies demonstrating its effectiveness.
Acceptance and commitment therapy.
Acceptance and commitment therapy or (ACT) (typically pronounced as the word "act") is a form of clinical behavior analysis (CBA) used in psychotherapy.
It is a psychological intervention that uses acceptance and mindfulness strategies mixed in different ways with commitment and behavior-change strategies, to increase psychological flexibility.
The approach was originally called "comprehensive distancing".
It was developed in the late 1980s by Steven C. Hayes, Kelly G. Wilson, and Kirk Strosahl.
Dialectical behavior therapy.
Mindfulness is a "core" exercise used in dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), a psychosocial treatment Marsha M. Linehan developed for treating people with borderline personality disorder.
DBT is dialectic, explains Linehan, in the sense of "the reconciliation of opposites in a continual process of synthesis."
As a practitioner of Buddhist meditation techniques, Linehan says: 
Mode deactivation therapy.
Mode deactivation therapy (MDT) is a treatment methodology that is derived from the principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy and incorporates elements of Acceptance and commitment therapy, Dialectical behavior therapy, and mindfulness techniques.
Mindfulness techniques such as simple breathing exercises are applied to assist the client in awareness and non-judgmental acceptance of unpleasant and distressing thoughts and feelings as they occur in the present moment.
Mode Deactivation Therapy was developed and is established as an effective treatment for adolescents with problem behaviors and complex trauma-related psychological problems, according to recent publications by Jack A. Apsche and Joan Swart.
Other programs.
research supports promising mindfulness-based therapies for a number of medical and psychiatric conditions, notably chronic pain, stress, anxiety and depression, substance abuse, and recurrent suicidal behavior.
Bell (2009) gives a brief overview of mindful approaches to therapy, particularly family therapy, starting with a discussion of mysticism and emphasizing the value of a mindful therapist.
The Japanese psychiatrist Shoma Morita, who trained in Zen meditation, developed Morita therapy upon principles of mindfulness and non-attachment.
The British doctor Clive Sherlock developed Adaptation Practice in 1977.
Adaptation Practice is a structured program of self-discipline.
Hakomi therapy, under development by Ron Kurtz and others, is a somatic psychology based upon Asian philosophical precepts of mindfulness and nonviolence.
Internal Family Systems Model (IFS), developed by Richard C. Schwartz, emphasizes the importance of both therapist and client engaging in therapy from the Self, which is the IFS term for one's "spiritual center".
The Self is curious about whatever arises in one's present experience and open and accepting toward all manifestations.
Mindfulness relaxation uses breathing methods, guided imagery, and other practices to relax the body and mind and help reduce stress.
Schools.
In 2012 Congressman Tim Ryan of Ohio published "A Mindful Nation", and received a $1 million federal grant to teach mindfulness in schools in his home district.
Mindful Kids Miami is a tax-exempt, 501 (c)(3), non-profit corporation established in 2011 dedicated to making age-appropriate mindfulness training available to school children in Miami-Dade County public and private schools.
This is primarily accomplished by training educators and other childcare providers to incorporate mindfulness practices in the children's daily activities.
In 2000, The Inner Kids Program, a mindfulness-based program developed for children, was introduced into public and private school curricula in the greater Los Angeles area.
MindUP, a classroom-based program spearheaded by Goldie Hawn's Hawn Foundation, teaches students to self-regulate behavior and mindfully engage in focused concentration required for academic success.
For the last decade, MindUP has trained teachers in over 1,000 schools in cities from Arizona to Washington.
The Holistic Life Foundation, a non-profit organization that created an in-school mindfulness program called Mindful Moment, is currently serving almost 350 students daily at Robert W. Coleman Elementary School and approximately 1300 students at Patterson Park High School in Baltimore, Maryland.
At Patterson High School, the Mindful Moment program engages the school's faculty along with the students during a 15-minute mindfulness practice at the beginning and end of each school day.
Mindful Life Project, a non-profit 501(c)3 based out of Richmond, California, teaches mindfulness to elementary school students in underserved schools in the South Richmond school district.
Utilizing curriculum, "Rise-Up" is a regular school day intervention program serving 430 students weekly, while "Mindful Community" is currently implemented at six South Richmond partner schools.
These in-school mindfulness programs have been endorsed by Richmond Mayor Gayle McLaughlin, who has recommended additional funding to expand the program in order to serve all Richmond youth.
Education.
Mindfulness practices are becoming more common within educational institutions including Elementary and Secondary schools.
This has been referred to as part of a 'contemplative turn' in education that has emerged since the turn of the millennium.
The applications of mindfulness in schools are aimed at calming and relaxation of students as well as for students and educators to build compassion and empathy for others.
An additional benefit to Mindfulness in education is for the practice to reduce anxiety and stress in students.
Based on a broad meta-analytical review, scholars argued that the application of mindfulness practice enhances the goals of education in the 21st century, which include adapting to a rapidly changing world and being a caring and committed citizen.
Within educational systems, the application of mindfulness practices shows an improvement of students' attention and focus, emotional regulation, creativity, and problem solving skills.
As discussed by Ergas and Todd, the development of this field since the turn of the millennium has brought diverse possibilities as well as complexities, given the origins of mindfulness within Buddhism and the processes of its secularization and measurement based on science.
Renshaw and Cook state, "As scientific interest in the utility of Mindfulness-Based Intervention (MBI) in schools grew steadily, popular interest in mindfulness in schools seemed to grow exponentially".
Despite research on mindfulness being comparatively unexamined, especially with young students, the practice has seen a spike in use within the educational arena.
"A relatively recent addition to discourse around preventing school expulsion and failure, mindfulness is gaining popularity for its potential to improve students' social, emotional, behavioral, and learning-related cognitive control, thereby improving academic outcomes".
Researchers and educators are interested in how mindfulness can provide optimal conditions for a students' personal development and academic success.
Current research on mindfulness in education is limited but can provide insight into the potential benefits for students, and areas of improvement for future studies.
Mindfulness in the classroom is being touted as a promising new intervention tool for young students.
According to Choudhury and Moses, "Although still marginal and in some cases controversial, secular programs of mindfulness have been implemented with ambitious goals of improving attentional focus of pupils, social-emotional learning in "at-risk" children and youth, not least, to intervene in problems of poverty and incarceration".
Emerging research is concerned with studying teachers and programs using mindfulness practices with students and is discovering tension arising from the moral reframing of eastern practices in western school settings.
As cited by Renshaw and Cook, "Unlike most other approaches to contemporary school-based intervention, which are squarely grounded in behavioral, cognitive-behavioral, and ecological systems theories, MBIs have their origins in Eastern religious traditions".
Some school administrators are concerned about implementing such practices, and parents have been reported to take their children out of mindfulness programs because of their personal religious beliefs.
Yet, MBIs continue to be accepted by the mainstream in both primary and secondary schools because, "Mindfulness practices, particularly in relation to children who might otherwise be considered broken or unredeemable, fill a critical niche – one that allows its advocates to imagine a world where people can change, become more compassionate, resilient, reflective, and aware; a world with a viable future".
As mindfulness in education continues to develop, ethical consequences will remain a controversial issue because the generic description for the "benefits" and "results" of MBIs are largely concerned with individual and inward-focused achievement, rather than the original Buddhist ideal of global human connection.
Available research reveals a relationship between mindfulness and attention.
Semple, Lee, Rosa, &amp; Miller argue, "Anxiety can impair attention and promote emotionally reactive behaviors that interfere with the development of good study skills, so it seems reasonable that increased mindfulness would be associated with less anxiety".
They conducted a randomized trial of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Children (MBCT-C) that found promise in managing anxiety for elementary school-aged children, and suggests that those who completed the program displayed fewer attention problems.
In addition, Flook shows how an eight-week mindfulness awareness program was evaluated in a random and controlled school setting and measured the effects of awareness practices on executive functions in elementary school children.
Their findings concluded, "Participation in the mindfulness awareness program was associated with improvements in behavioral regulation, metacognition, and overall executive functions".
In the study by Flook, parents and teachers completed questionnaires which propose that participation in mindfulness programs is associated with improvements in child behavioral regulation.
These perspectives are a valuable source of data given that caregivers and educators interact with the children daily and across a variety of settings.
According to Eklund, Omalley, and Meyer, "School-based practitioners should find promise in the evidence supporting mindfulness-based practices with children, parents, and educators".
Lastly, a third study by Zenner, Herrnleben-Kurz, and Walach concluded, "Analysis suggest that mindfulness-based interventions for children and youths are able to increase cognitive capacity of attending and learning by nearly one standard deviation and yield".
Application of Mindfulness-Based Interventions continue to increase in popularity and practice.
Mindfulness-Based Interventions are rising across western culture, but its effectiveness in school programs is still being determined.
Research contends, "Mindfulness-based approaches for adults are effective at enhancing mental health, but few controlled trials have evaluated their effectiveness among young people".
Although much of the available studies find a high number of mindfulness acceptability among students and teachers, more research needs to be conducted on its effects on well-being and mental health for students.
In a firmly controlled experiment, Johnson, Burke, Brinkman, and Wade evaluated "the impact of an existing and widely available school-based mindfulness program".
According to their research, "no improvements were demonstrated on any outcome measured either immediately post-intervention or at three-month follow-up".
Many questions remain on which practices best implement effective and reliable mindfulness programs at schools, and further research is needed to identify the optimal methods and measurement tools for mindfulness in education.
Business.
Mindfulness training appears to be getting popular in the business world, and many large corporations have been incorporating mindfulness practices into their culture.
For example, companies such as Google, Apple, Procter &amp; Gamble, General Mills, Mayo Clinic, and the U.S. Army offer mindfulness coaching, meditation breaks and other resources to their employees to improve workplace functioning.
The introduction of mindfulness in corporate settings still remains in early stages and its potential long-term impact requires further assessment.
Mindfulness has been found to result in better employee well-being, lower levels of frustration, lower absenteeism and burnout as well as an improved overall work environment.
Law.
Legal and law enforcement organizations are also showing interest in mindfulness: 
Prison-programs.
Mindfulness has been taught in prisons, reducing hostility and mood disturbance among inmates, and improving their self-esteem.
Additional studies indicate that mindfulness interventions can result in significant reductions in anger, reductions in substance use, increased relaxation capacity, self-regulation and optimism.
Government.
Many government organizations offer mindfulness training.
Coping Strategies is an example of a program utilized by United States Armed Forces personnel.
The British Parliament organized a mindfulness-session for its members in 2014, led by Ruby Wax.
Scientific research.
Effects and efficacy of mindfulness practice.
Mindfulness has gained increasing empirical attention since 1970 and has been studied often as an intervention for stress reduction.
Meta analyses indicate its beneficial effects for healthy adults, for adolescents and children, as well as for different health-related outcomes including weight management, psychiatric conditions, heart disease, sleep disorders, cancer care, adult autism treatment, multiple sclerosis, and other health-related conditions.
An often-cited meta-analysis on meditation research published in JAMA in 2014, found insufficient evidence of any effect of meditation programs on positive mood, attention, substance use, eating habits, sleep, and weight, but found that there is moderate evidence that meditation reduces anxiety, depression, and pain.
However, this study included a highly heterogeneous group of meditation styles (i.e., it did not focus exclusively on mindfulness meditation), which is a significant limitation of this study.
Additionally, while mindfulness is well known to have positive psychological effect among individuals diagnosed with various types of cancers, the evidence is unclear regarding its effectiveness in men with prostate cancer.
Thousands of studies on meditation have been conducted, though the methodological quality of some of the studies is poor.
Recent reviews have pointed out many of these issues.
Nonetheless, mindfulness meditation is a popular subject for research, and many present potential benefits for a wide array of conditions and outcomes.
For example, the practice of mindfulness has also been used to improve athletic performance, as a beneficial intervention for children with special needs and their caregivers, as a viable treatment option for people with insomnia an effective intervention for healthy aging, as a strategy for managing dermatological conditions and as a useful intervention during pregnancy and the perinatal period.
Recent studies have also demonstrated that mindfulness meditation significantly attenuates physical pain through multiple, unique mechanisms.
Meditation also may allow one to modulate pain.
When exposed to pain from heating, the brain scans of the mindfulness meditation participants (by use of functional magnetic resonance imaging) showed their brains notice the pain equally, however it does not get converted to a perceived pain signal.
As such they experienced up to 40–50% less pain.
Further, mindfulness meditation also appears to lead to increased telomere length, which is an important finding considering that short telomeres can be a risk factor for the development of several chronic health conditions.
Research has also investigated mindful movements and mindful exercises for different patient populations.
Mindfulness-based approaches are a major subject of increasing research interest, 52 papers were published in 2003, rising to 477 by 2012.
Nearly 100 randomized controlled trials had been published by early 2014.
Neurological studies.
Research studies have also focused on the effects of mindfulness on the brain using neuroimaging techniques, physiological measures and behavioral tests.
Research on the neural perspective of how mindfulness meditation works suggests that it exerts its effects in components of attention regulation, body awareness and emotional regulation.
When considering aspects such as sense of responsibility, authenticity, compassion, self-acceptance and character, studies have shown that mindfulness meditation contributes to a more coherent and healthy sense of self and identity.
Neuroimaging techniques suggest that mindfulness practices such as mindfulness meditation are associated with "changes in the anterior cingulate cortex, insula, temporo-parietal junction, fronto-limbic network and default mode network structures."
Further, mindfulness meditation may prevent or delay the onset of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
Additionally, mindfulness-induced emotional and behavioral changes have been found to be related to functional and structural changes in the brain.
It has also been suggested that the default mode network of the brain can be used as a potential biomarker for monitoring the therapeutic benefits of meditation.
Recent research also suggest that the practice of mindfulness could influence genetic expression leading to a reduced risk of inflammation-related diseases and favourable changes in biomarkers.
Grey matter concentrations in brain regions that regulate emotion, self-referential processing, learning and memory processes have shown changes in density following MBSR.
Additionally, MBSR practice has been associated with improvement of the immune system which could explain the correlation between stress reduction and increased quality of life.
Part of these changes are a result of the thickening of the prefrontal cortex (executive functioning) and hippocampus (learning and memorisation ability), the shrinking of the amygdala (emotion and stress response) and the strengthening of the connections between brain cells.
Long-term meditators have larger amounts of gyrification ("folding" of the cortex, which may allow the brain to process information faster) than people who do not meditate.
Further, a direct correlation was found between the amount of gyrification and the number of meditation years, possibly providing further proof of the brain's neuroplasticity, or ability to adapt to environmental changes.
Associations of mindfulness with other variables.
Mindfulness (as a trait, distinguished from mindfulness "practice") has been linked to many outcomes.
In an overview, Keng, Smoski, and Robins summarize: "Trait mindfulness has been associated with higher levels of life satisfaction, agreeableness, conscientiousness, vitality, self esteem, empathy, sense of autonomy, competence, optimism, and pleasant affect.
A 2020 study found links between dispositional mindfulness and prosocial behavior.
Studies have also demonstrated significant negative correlations between mindfulness and depression, neuroticism, absentmindedness, dissociation, rumination, cognitive reactivity, social anxiety, difficulties in emotion regulation, experiential avoidance, alexithymia, intensity of delusional experience in the context of psychosis, and general psychological symptoms."
(References to underlying studies omitted from quotation.)
Effects on mindfulness.
The mechanisms that make people less or more mindful have been researched less than the effects of mindfulness programmes, so we do not know much about what are the relevant components of mindfulness practice.
For example, meta-analyses have shown that mindfulness practice does increase mindfulness when compared to active control groups.
This may be because we do not know how to measure mindfulness.
It could also be that mindfulness is dose-dependent and increases with more experience.
To counter that, Bergomi et al. found that "results provide evidence for the associations between self-reported mindfulness and meditation practice and suggest that mindfulness is particularly associated with continued practice in the present, rather than with accumulated practice over years."
Some research into other mechanisms has been done.
One study conceptualized such mechanisms in terms of competition for attention.
In a test of that framework, mindfulness was found to be associated (as predicted) with having an activated intention to be mindful, with feeling good, and with not being hurried or very busy.
Regarding the relationship between feeling good and being mindful, a different study found that causality probably works both ways: feeling good increases mindfulness, and mindfulness increases feeling good.
One theory suggests an additional mechanism termed as "reperceiving".
Reperceiving is the beneficial effect that comes after the process of being mindful after all the intention, attention, and attitude has been experienced.
Through reperceiving there is a shift in perspective.
Reperceiving permits disassociation from thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations, and allows one to exist with them instead of being defined by them.
Concerns and criticism.
Scholarly research.
Many of the above cited review studies also indicate the necessity for more high-quality research in this field such as conducting intervention studies using larger sample sizes, the use of more randomized controlled studies and the need for providing more methodological details in reported studies.
The majority of studies also either measure mindfulness as a trait, and in research that use mindfulness interventions in clinical practice, the lack of true randomisation poses a problem for understanding the true effectiveness of mindfulness.
Experimental methods using randomised samples, though, suggest that mindfulness as a state or temporary practice can influence felt emotions such as disgust and promote abstract decision-making.
There are also a few review studies that have found little difference between mindfulness interventions and control groups, though they did also indicate that their intervention group was treated too briefly for the research to be conclusive.
In some domains, such as sport, a lack of internal validity across studies prevents any strong claims being made about the effects of mindfulness.
These studies also list the need for more robust research investigations.
Several issues pertaining to the assessment of mindfulness have also been identified including the current use of self-report questionnaires.
Potential for bias also exists to the extent that researchers in the field are also practitioners and possibly subject to pressures to publish positive or significant results.
Various scholars have criticized how mindfulness has been defined or represented in recent Western psychology publications.
These modern understandings depart significantly from the accounts of mindfulness in early Buddhist texts and authoritative commentaries in the Theravada and Indian Mahayana traditions.
Adam Valerio has introduced the idea that conflict between academic disciplines over how mindfulness is defined, understood, and popularly presented may be indicative of a personal, institutional, or paradigmatic battle for ownership over mindfulness, one where academics, researchers, and other writers are invested as individuals in much the same way as religious communities.
Shortcomings.
The popularization of mindfulness as a "commodity" has been criticized, being termed "McMindfulness" by some critics.
According to John Safran, the popularity of mindfulness is the result of a marketing strategy: "McMindfulness is the marketing of a constructed dream; an idealized lifestyle; an identity makeover."
The psychologist Thomas Joiner argues that modern mindfulness meditation has been "corrupted" for commercial gain by self-help celebrities, and suggests that it encourages unhealthy narcissistic and self-obsessed mindsets.
According to Purser and Loy, mindfulness is not being used as a means to awaken to insight in the "unwholesome roots of greed, ill will and delusion," but reshaped into a "banal, therapeutic, self-help technique" that has the opposite effect of reinforcing those passions.
While mindfulness is marketed as a means to reduce stress, in a Buddhist context it is part of an all-embracing ethical program to foster "wise action, social harmony, and compassion."
The privatization of mindfulness neglects the societal and organizational causes of stress and discomfort, instead propagating adaptation to these circumstances.
According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, "[A]bsent a sharp social critique, Buddhist practices could easily be used to justify and stabilize the status quo, becoming a reinforcement of consumer capitalism."
The popularity of this new brand of mindfulness has resulted in the commercialization of meditation through self-help books, guided meditation classes, and mindfulness retreats.
Buddhist commentators have criticized the movement as being presented as equivalent to Buddhist practice, while in reality it is very possibly denatured with undesirable consequences, such as being ungrounded in the traditional reflective morality and therefore, astray from traditional Buddhist ethics.
Criticisms suggest it to be either de-moralized or re-moralized into clinically based ethics.
The conflict is often presented with concern to the teacher's credentials and qualifications, rather than the student's actual practice.
Reformed Buddhist-influenced practices are being standardized and manualized in a distinct separation from Buddhism - which is seen as a religion based in monastic temples - and expressed as “mindfulness” in a new psychology ethic, practiced in modern meditation centers.
Risks.
In media reports, people have attributed unexpected effects of increasing fear and anxiety, panic or "meltdowns" after practicing, which they suggest could expose bipolar vulnerability or repressed PTSD symptoms.
However, according to published peer-reviewed academic articles, these negative effects of meditation are rare for mindfulness meditation, and appear to happen due to a poor understanding of what actually constitutes mindfulness/meditation practices.
School of Philosophy and Economic Science 
The School of Philosophy and Economic Science (SPES), also operating under the names the School of Philosophy and the School of Practical Philosophy and legally named the School of Economic Science (SES), is a worldwide organisation based in London.
It offers non-academic courses for adults, ranging from an introductory series called Practical Philosophy to more advanced classes.
Its teachings are principally influenced by Advaita Vedanta, an orthodox philosophical system of Hinduism.
It has a guru, Sri Vasudevananda Saraswati, who used the title Shankaracharya until 2017.
The organisation has been the subject of controversy, especially in connection with historical child abuse and the mistreatment of women; it has also been described as a cult, sect or new religious movement.
The organization advertises introductory courses entitled "Practical Philosophy", "Economics with Justice" and other courses including Sanskrit language.
The Practical Philosophy course involves a meditative process known as "The Exercise" and discussion of universal themes drawing on the work of European and Indian philosophers such as Plato, Marsilio Ficino, Swami Vivekananda and Adi Shankara, as well as Advaita.
Those who continue involvement beyond 4 years mainly study Advaita; they are encouraged to marry, and are required to take up meditation, to undertake voluntary work to help with the running of the organization and to attend residential programmes.
The organization's members have founded schools for the education of children in a number of countries.
The organization is registered as a charity in the UK; worldwide operations register as non-profit organisations in their own countries.
The organization was founded in London by Labour MP Andrew MacLaren.
His successor and son, SES leader Leon MacLaren (1910-1994), a barrister introduced programs on Advaita Vedanta.
According to the SES financial report for 2017, it had a total of 3173 enrolments in the UK at the close of that year.
As of 2012 it had a total of around 20,000 in up to 80 branches worldwide.
Operating under various names, there are branches in America, Canada, Venezuela, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Trinidad, Belgium, Cyprus, Greece, Holland, Malta, Spain, Ireland, Hungary, Germany, Israel and Argentina.
The head of all of these branches is the SES 'Senior Tutor', MacLaren's successor, Donald Lambie, who is also a barrister.
The organization's course fees are kept low to encourage recruitment; thanks to donations and wills, the organisation has a substantial cash pile and a worldwide property portfolio, including several mansions.
It is the subject of the novel "Shame on You" by Clara Salaman.
History.
Foundation.
The School of Economic Science was founded in 1938, in the UK, by Andrew MacLaren and his son Leon MacLaren, under the name Henry George School of Economics.
It was an economics study group that expounded the economic theories of the American economist Henry George.
The group initially met in a Parliamentary committee room of the Houses of Parliament.Leon MacLaren inherited the organisation from his father, Andrew, and changed its focus to "the study of natural laws governing the relations between men in society."
He considered science to be a study of laws that already exist in nature; economics the study of human nature and its interaction with the natural universe.
In 1942 the name of the group was changed to the School of Economic Science; this name stayed on until the change of the name on publicity material in 2019 to the "School of Philosophy and Economic Science".
Influence of Ouspensky and Gurdjieff.
MacLaren studied the book "The Realm of Art" (1946), a wide-ranging survey of ideas about the nature of humanity, society, art, science, religion, evolution, creativity, free will, mind and matter, knowledge and consciousness.
It was this book which first introduced him to the ideas of Ouspensky; he incorporated its ideas to the SES and invited the author, Peter Goffin, to give lectures.
P. D. Ouspensky was a pupil of G. I. Gurdjieff and their philosophy, called the "Fourth Way", were incorporated.
Gurdjieff is both praised as a charismatic intellectual who brought greater insight to Western thought, and rebuked as an egomaniacal charlatan who worked followers to exhaustion to break down personality.
In 1953, MacLaren met Francis C. Roles, a pupil of Ouspensky who had established the Study Society in 1951 to continue the teaching of the Fourth Way.
MacLaren systematised the Gurdjieff system and incorporated these ideas into his courses; the ideas were blended with sociology, and man's inner nature was considered in the context of the forces that govern society.
When Maclaren died in the mid-1990s, the SES gradually underwent a change in approach, choosing to be more open.
Nowadays, SES seems to have phased out most of its Gurdjieffian material (it no longer uses MacLaren's lectures) although it acknowledges Gurdjieff and Ouspensky as a source of the first Philosophy courses on its official SES website.
Influence of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.
Ouspensky believed that Gurdjieff's teachings were incomplete and both Roles and MacLaren were eager to discover the missing elements.
In 1959, MacLaren discovered the teachings of Advaita Vedanta after meeting the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and began to practice Transcendental Meditation (TM).
Both Roles and MacLaren became pupils of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.
On 13 March 1961, MacLaren organised a meeting, called the "1961 World Congress", for the Maharishi at the Royal Albert Hall.
Two days prior to the event smaller meetings were held at Caxton Hall.
The Royal Albert Hall meeting was attended by 5,000 people, nearly all SES members.
One attendee described the effect of the talk as "tremendous", causing him to feel like a prisoner that had just been released.
He speculated that meditation was the missing link of the incomplete Gurdjieff-Ouspensky system.
The particular type of meditation used by SES was developed by Brahmananda Saraswati (Gurudeva).
MacLaren was taken through its initiation ritual, and speculated that he had found the source of Gurdjieff's ideas.
Shantananda Saraswati taught that the practice of meditation in a regular and disciplined manner is of the very highest importance.
Meditation became central to SES' philosophy program and is taken up by all senior members of the group.
School of Meditation.
SES was instrumental in promoting Transcendental Meditation (TM) in the UK from the 1960s.
In collaboration with the Study Society and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, SES established the School of Meditation (SoM) in London in 1961, under the direction of Bill Whiting.
SoM's purpose was, and remains, to study and teach the principles and practical application of meditation.
Many of the subsequent leaders of SoM were students of the Maharishi.
The School of Meditation is now an independent, self-governing organisation.
By 2011, SoM had initiated 15,332 people into the practice of meditation, it has branches in several parts of the UK as well as in Greece and Holland.
Both SES and SoM teach Transcendental Meditation as introduced by the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, an ancient technique the revival of which is credited to Brahmananda Saraswati.
Advaita.
On a trip to India to study meditation with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Roles met the Shankarcharya of Jyotir Math, Swami Shantanand Saraswati, who Roles believed was the spiritual advisor both the Study society and SES were seeking and introduced MacLaren to Shantandand of whom they both became students.
Swami Shantananda Saraswati had been a disciple, with the Maharishi, of the previous Shankaracharya of Jyotir Math, Swami Brahmananda Saraswati.
From this point on, MacLaren's teachings became predominately based on Advanta Vedanta, which he disseminated within SES.
During the mid-1950s, Practical Philosophy became the central subject of teaching and practice at SES and remains so today.
MacLaren's discussions with Shantanand Saraswati solidified the central principle of SES' philosophy as "unity in diversity", a merger of Eastern philosophy and Western wisdom.
From 1965, every second year for the rest of his life, MacLaren conversed with Shantananda Saraswat and these conversations were taped and transcribed.
These conversations are published in a four volume series.
Teaching is disseminated by SES advanced students who are volunteer teachers, and is maintained by the successors of MacLaren and Shantanand Saraswati, these being Donald Lambie and SES guru Sri Vasudevananda Saraswati respectively.
MacLaran also met another Indian sage, Daṇḍī Svāmī Nārāyaṇānanda Sarasvatī, who was a student of both Shantananda Saraswathi and Brahmananda Saraswati.
Daṇḍī Svāmī Nārāyaṇānanda Sarasvatī was also linked with the leader of the SES branch in Holland.
Sanskrit language.
In his conversations with MacLaren, Shantananda Saraswati stated the importance of Sanskrit language in the study of Advaita.
The study of Sanskrit language at SES began in the late 1960s and became a formal part of what was called the "middle school" in 1977.
SES is considered a world-class centre for the study of Sanskrit.
Art in Action.
In 1977, the Art Department at SES began an annual, four-day art festival called Art in Action at Waterperry Gardens; the first event attracted 14,000 visitors and recent events have each attracted about 25,000 visitors.
The purpose of the event was to demonstrate the principles of SES by allowing artists and craftspeople to be observed in the act of creating their art, the aim being to bring masters and beginners together in a bid to encourage creativity.
Over the years the number of artists exhibiting increased from 51 to 400, specially selected for the quality of their work.
The event also included lectures by experts from the National Association of Decorative and Fine Art Societies, and 3,000 places on practical courses in 20 different subjects.
Around 900 volunteers from SES staffed the event.
The event was started by steward of Waterperry Estate, Bernard Saunders, and was organised by Jeremy Sinclair CBE between 2005 - 2014, and later Simon Buchanan 
After 40 years, the organisers announced that Art in Action would "pause", and that their vision is for Waterperry Gardens to "develop as a centre for the arts in the years to come".
Since then the organisation has hosted the Handmade in Britain festival, Celebrating Ceramics, the Oxford Storytelling Festival and the Waterperry Opera Festival.
New leader.
In 1992 Shantanand Saraswati advised Leon MacLaren to choose a successor.
He chose Donald Lambie, a lawyer, who had joined SES aged 17 in 1973.
Donald Lambie succeeded Leon Maclaren upon his death in 1994.
His succession was approved by the 200-strong Fellowship of senior members of the organisation.
Sri Shantanand Saraswati died in 1997.
Donald Lambie established contact with his successor, Sri Vasudevananda Saraswati, who took on the role of guru to SES.
Sri Vasudevananda Saraswati continues to act in that role.
Waterperry frescos.
Following a project by SES architects and artists' groups to plan and construct a new hall at Waterperry House which began in 1971, in 1999–2001, frescos spanning three floors, illustrating SES' philosophies, were added to the property to create a sacred space intended to last at least 500 years.
The architects and artists let their designs arise from reflection on a passage from one of the great texts of Advaita philosophy, the Brihadaranyaka Unpanishad: "In the beginning this self was indeed Brahman.
It knew only itself as 'I am Brahman'.
Therefore, it became All."
Maclaren's intention was to create a place fit for King Janaka, accordingly the bridge and staircase was planned in glass.
Children's education.
In 1975, SES founded the St James Independent Schools in London, comprising one school for girls and one for boys, both catering to children from 4–18 years of age.
Today, only around 10 per cent of the children at St James have parents involved with SES.
They're ranked in the Sunday Times' top UK schools guide.
St Vedast's School for Boys, at Sarum Chase in Hampstead, London, was also founded in the mid-1970s and closed in 1985.
Other schools included the Ficino School in Auckland, New Zealand; St James Preparatory Schools in Cape Town, Durban and Johannesburg, South Africa; John Colet School, Sydney, Australia; Erasmus School, Melbourne, Australia; the St James Independent Schools in London; Alcuin school in Leeds (closed in 2009); St James' primary school in Stockport (closed in 2015); and John Scottus School in Dublin.
St James Junior Boys merged with the Junior Girls School to form St James Juniors in 2015.
Greek philosophy, Eastern philosophy, Vedic dancing, Shakespeare, Renaissance art, meditation, mindfulness, Latin, Greek, Sanskrit language, calligraphy, and Vedic maths are taught in some of these schools from a very early age, in addition to the regular curriculum.
There is also a strong emphasis on sport through team games, music and arts.
Children are taught the virtues of politeness, courtesy, truthfulness and honesty.
Historical child abuse allegations.
St. James &amp; St Vedast Schools.
In the early 1980s the St James and St Vedast children schools founded and run by the SES received complaints from parents and were subject to a critical "series of articles"" in the "London Evening Standard", focusing on the School's harsh discipline regime and its links to the School of Economic Science, which the journalists described as a "cult".
In 2004, an "internet message board" was set up on which former St. James and St Vedast pupils shared recollections including many complaints of mistreatment, unreasonable punishment and assault.
The St James Schools Inquiry.
In 2005, following complaints on the "internet message board" from former pupils, the Governors of the St James Schools initiated a private inquiry, chaired by British QC, James Townsend, into the allegations.
The investigation found that during the 1975 to 1985 time period, children had been "criminally assaulted" while attending the schools.
The chairman of the inquiry described cases where boys were “punched in the face or in the stomach, cuffed violently about the head, had blackboard rubbers thrown at them causing injury in some cases, had cricket balls thrown at them violently when they were not looking at the thrower and were struck with the end of a gym rope.
Other students were kicked, struck from behind, slapped about the face, thrown across a classroom”.
The report stated “Whatever the provocation nothing could justify this mistreatment.
It was clearly unreasonable and criminal”.
In response to the report the school stated the teachers named in the report “will receive disciplinary warnings”, but that “there is no plan to remove them from the schools”.
The teachers no longer work at St James.
Inquiry press &amp; media coverage.
The Inquiry report was publicised by a "Channel 4 television news special report" on 15 March 2006 and "in national and local newspapers".
The Channel 4 social affairs correspondent, Victoria Macdonald, interviewed former St. James pupils and the then-headmaster, David Boddy, who said this was the first time the Governors had heard of the complaints.
The program reported that there had been complaints about punishment regimes in 1983 and that meetings had been held with parents which Boddy himself attended.
The report also stated that "there has been a real change in the ethos and conduct of the schools is established by the evidence of those witnesses, not naturally well disposed towards the SES, who speak of them as happy places where there appears to be a relaxed atmosphere between pupils and teachers" 
In December 2020 a "BBC News report" stated that "nearly £1m in compensation had been paid to dozens of former students at St James and St Vedast schools following historical allegations of abuse".
Following the legal action, which was launched against the school in 2016, the BBC reported "45 former students who attended the schools between 1975 and 1992 had so far received payments of up to £30,000 each.
All of the cases were settled without an admission of liability and did not come before court".
Legal claims were led by specialist abuse compensation solicitor Malcolm Johnson, of Hudgell Solicitors, in a scheme set to close on 31 January 2021.
One of the recipients of the compensation stated: "I still have not had an apology and I do not believe there is any real remorse on their part, but I don’t believe that we ever would have got this far without Malcolm’s involvement.
They’ve not admitted being liable for what happened, despite paying damages to so many, so I feel it has still been done with contempt after all this time."
The Plato School.
The Plato children’s school in Amsterdam was founded by the Dutch branch of SES, with close links to the UK St James Schools.
It was subject to Dutch Police investigations in 1996 and 2000 into incidents of illegal physical punishments and mistreatment of children.
The headteacher of the school was prosecuted and found guilty of assault.
The school closed in 2002 after the second police investigation and around the time of a permanent split within the SES in the Netherlands.
Interviews with former pupils.
Actress Emily Watson attended St. James, where in a 2020 Times interview she says she witnessed "incidents of extreme cruelty that I know have been very scarring for people going forward in their lives”.
In 2009 actress and former St James pupil Clara Salaman published "Shame On You", a novel based on her own experiences with the school and an organisation she was brought up in; she did not name it for legal reasons, but other sources identified it as the School of Economic Science.
She described the organisation as "a self-styled, extremely strict, truth-seeking, spiritual society that demanded an extraordinary amount from its members."
In an interview she told Radio New Zealand that 75% to 85% of her book is an account of real events from her own childhood.
These included teachers marrying former pupils, and mental and physical abuse that led her to contemplate suicide, another girl to attempt suicide, and a third to successfully carry out suicide.
"Now it's a very different place, I'm always told," she said.
Teachings and practices.
Teaching at SES is done in small groups, in the form of a dialogue between tutor and students following the Socratic tradition, rather than establishing a set course with a curriculum, textbooks and examinations.
All of the SES tutors are advanced students; none is paid.
Courses include Philosophy, Economics, Art, Vedic Mathematics and Practical Philosophy in Business.
SES teaches a variety of 10 week courses, beginning each January, May and September.
Practical philosophy.
SES teaches a philosophy drawn from Eastern and Western traditions.
Differing from academic philosophy courses, "SES is closer to the ancients’ conception of a philosophy school in which students are taught one particular philosophy or ethical way of life, which they commit to in an effort to completely transform themselves."
An underlying idea is that the great teachings of the world all point to the same central truths, and that wisdom is the key to a better life.
Teaching is based on the precepts of Advaita Vedanta as translated, taped and transcribed from interviews in India conducted by MacLaren with Swami Shantanand Saraswati (d.1997), a colleague of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, from 1961 - 1996.
"Advaita" means literally "not two"; "vedanta" refers to the knowledge underlying the creation.
Together these are said to explain the essential unity of everything in creation and the source from which it arises.
SES considers Advaita to be "the clearest and most systematic expression we have found of the common philosophy that lies at the heart of many of the world’s great religions and philosophies".
Non-dual philosophy arises from ancient vedic scriptures expounded by Shankara.
This teaching, along with the expansion of it in relation to the modern age by Santanand Saraswati, is the foundation of the philosophy course.
The course operates on the principle that the teaching achieves nothing unless put into practice in everyday living.
Through practice, it eventually becomes understanding and a part of one's own nature.
According to SES' web site, the relationship between the organisation and Advaita Vedanta developed as follows: 
The introductory philosophy course draws from a variety of sources, including the Bhagavad Gita, the Upanishads, the Bible, Plato, Marsilio Ficino, Hermes Trismegistus, Shakespeare and Emerson.
As students progress through SES they don't learn deeper truths, but gain a deeper understanding of the same truth with which they're presented on the first night.
What the SES calls 'The Exercise' is a central element of its practice; instructions have been published by the New York Times.
Voluntary work.
Members are encouraged to do volunteer work with and for fellow students, and for the communities in which they live.
Service to fellow human beings, without personal reward or gain, is considered an important part of the organisation's philosophy of seeking the truth.
Retreats.
SES hosts retreats for those students who've graduated from foundation courses.
On the retreats, such students spend longer periods of time practising what they've learnt and furthering their study.
The retreats provide a setting in which students can dedicate themselves more fully to the philosophy.
These can be between 2 and 10 days in length.
Economics with Justice.
SES says that discovering the conditions which allow every individual to find a fulfilling life is the true goal of Economics, and that the current economic situation where "Some men work to maintain others who labour not" is unjust.
Economic science is normally considered the mathematical approach to Economics, but SES uses a different definition, rooted in the philosophy of Advaita Vedanta.
A four-term economics course is taught seeking to show that "Freedom and prosperity are possible for people everywhere, providing we follow economic laws and aim for a fair outcome from economic arrangements".
SES has published its economic theories and principles in a 2013 book "The Science of Economics".
It has made written submissions to the Scottish Government Commission on Local Tax Reform, the London Assembly Inquiry into Land Value Taxation for London and the House of Commons, Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee on Land Value Capture.
It has been described as "Georgist", but has widened its scope of enquiry beyond George to include financial reform and debt.
Meditation.
SES members are introduced to meditation and given a specific mantra; those who have already been initiated into the Transcendental Meditation technique are allowed to keep their own mantra.
SES encourages students to meditate for 30 minutes, twice a day.
Students are introduced to meditation in the second year of the course, after which the regular practice of meditation is central to the teachings.
There is a simple initiation ceremony as described by one of the organisation's American websites:In the School, a traditional system of mantra meditation is made available to all students who have taken Philosophy Works followed by the Foundation Courses.
Seated comfortably in a balanced and upright position, the activities of the mind and body are brought under observation, and then allowed to fall away as the attention is directed to the sound of the mantra.
This results in an experience of quiet stillness.
Remaining still and listening to the sound of the mantra is all that is required.
The rest unfolds naturally.
The introduction to meditation is marked by a simple, dignified ceremony.
Students are asked to present traditional offerings of fruit, flowers and a gift of money that is used solely for making meditation available throughout North America.
Following the introduction, ongoing assistance is offered in the form of one-on-one tutorials and classroom discussions.The meditation initiation involves a trained initiator and an initiate who wishes to take up the practice of meditation.
The initiator recites verses in Sanskrit and symbolic offerings of fruits and flowers are made.
The initiate is asked only to witness the ceremony and is not asked to get involved.
This is done to attune the initiate's mind to 'pick up' the sound of the mantra.
At the end of the ceremony the initiator becomes silent and begins to intonate the mantra.
The initiate is then given the mantra and instruction on how to use it.
Renaissance studies.
Renaissance studies by SES have led to the publication of several works, including translations from Latin of many of Marsilio Ficino's letters The translators were led by Clement Salaman.
SES members have also translated the works of Hermes Trismegistus, after whom Hermetic Philosophy is named.
SES members have contributed to the BBC programs on renaissance topics, in 2005 providing insights into the historical meaning of the word heaven and its possible implications, and in 2009 on the influence of Plato and Aristotle on the Renaissance.
Sanskrit language.
SES represents the largest body of Sanskrit students in the UK.
SES currently teaches Sanskrit from beginner level to IGCSE 
Ayurveda.
SES has been an informal networking centre for individuals interested in Ayurveda, however, it has never taken any formal initiatives related to ayurvedic medicine.
Since the 1970s some well-known ayurvedic practitioners have had loose associations with the SES.
Administration (UK).
Course fees are kept low to encourage recruitment; they are a small part of the organisation's income, while donations and wills have enabled the SES to own substantial properties.
Donald Lambie is supported by a nine-member Executive Committee elected by the 230-person governing body of the SES, known as the 'Fellowship'.
It has 240 'Ordinary Members' and 41 'Associate Members' in its Fellowship.
The principal of SES is Ian Mason, a barrister and a global facilitator for the UN Harmony with Nature project.
The Fellowship rules include by 6 objects the first and principal one being: 
Any person Enrolled on a Philosophy of Economics course can be invited by the Executive Committee to become an Ordinary Member of the Fellowship.
In the UK courses are held in nearly 50 towns and cities.
In 1972 the UK branch of SES purchased the Waterperry Estate in Oxfordshire, including its horticultural business, which it continues to run to generate revenue for the SES.
In 1986 Nanpantan Hall in Loughborough was bequeathed to the SES, and it also owns Brinscall Hall in Preston, as well as eleven further freehold properties and one long leasehold.
These include Mandeville Place in London, Belmont House in Stockport, Park House in Glasgow.
Other properties are in London, Leeds, Croydon, Edinburgh, Guildford and Colchester.
In 2005, the SES sold one of its mansions, Sarum Chase in Hampstead, for £9.3 million.
In 2017 the UK charities commission shows the organisation had an income of £5.1m and spending of £4.0m.
The organisation also has £15.5m of own use assets, £10.0m of long-term investments, and £2.3m of other assets.
The UK organisation has 9 trustees, 98 employees, 500 volunteers and lists its area of operation as the UK.
Slightly more than half of the tutors and half the students are female.
SES has been described as an "exclusively a British organisation".
Apart from two office staff, all the SES's work is done on a voluntary basis.
Worldwide operations.
SES is one of the most widespread organisations related to Advaita, in addition to the campuses in the United Kingdom, most of which are called The School of Economic Science, there are several dozen associated branch organisations worldwide, most of which are called the School of Practical Philosophy or some variant of that name.
The first such operation was established in Wellington, New Zealand in 1957.
Another sources shows the in Canada SES was chartered under the companies act of Ontario as a non-profit body in 1939.
One of the best known is the School of Practical Philosophy in New York City, founded in 1964. here are branches in USA, Canada, Venezuela, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Trinidad, Belgium, Cyprus, Greece, Holland, Malta, Spain, Ireland, Hungary, Germany, Israel, Fiji and Argentina.
According to the spokesperson for the New York branch, Dr Monica Vecchio, SES and the School of Practical Philosophy are "the same thing with different names.
There are 70 or 80 [branches] around the world.
Each share the same course curriculum, with the same content.
The principles are the same, the practices are the same, the stream of discussion is the same."
A branch of the organisation called the School of Practical Philosophy opened in 1964 in New York City.
The New York facility was launched in 1964 as a not-for-profit corporation chartered by the Board of Regents of the State of New York.
It received tax-exempt status in 1982.
It has branches in the Hudson Valley; Rochester, New York; Albany, Georgia; Scottsdale, Arizona; South Florida; San Francisco; Boston; and the state of New Jersey.
The main branch is located at 12 East 79th Street in Manhattan.
There is an additional property in Wallkill, New York, in a mansion once owned by Marion Borden.
It bought an Upper East Side mansion from millionaire Charles Ogden in 1975, and put it on sale in 2014 for $51 million.
Many New Yorkers are aware of the School of Practical Philosophy and its 10-week foundation course, Philosophy Works, due to extensive advertising in the subway, featuring the taglines "this poster can make you happier than any other on the subway" and "sustainable happiness".
The Philosophy Works series is offered several times a year.
The actor Hugh Jackman has been involved with the organisation since 1993.
Publications and comments.
The organisation has been described in a variety of different ways: a "human potential movement", as providing "mind discipline" for achieving mental quiescence, as cult, sect or new religious movement, as a non-religious organisation, or a platonic community, a "Gurdjieff fringe group" or neo-Gurdjieffian movement, as "Georgist".
Commentators have pointed out that SES members do not consider it to be a religion, rather a philosophy, and some members for example may well be committed to mainstream churches.
SES state that "Advaita does not stand in the place of religion.
Rather, as many students in the School of a religious disposition have found, it has the capacity to expand and deepen an understanding of their own religion, whatever it may be.
It is equally valuable for, and applicable to, those who practise no religion."
Shantanand Saraswati stated that people do not need to change their religious beliefs to follow the principles of Advaita.
Comments from journalists and authors.
In the early 1960s, British Buddhist teacher and writer Sangharakshita (Dennis Lingwood) returned to England after 20 years in India.
His book "Moving Against The Stream" includes descriptions of SES member Terry Delamare's experience at the organisation during this period.
SES is described as "the organisation whose meetings Terry attended most regularly, and whose teachings he took most seriously" during difficult times.
The philosophy taught was described as "a curious amalgam of Western Esoterism and brahminical Advaita Vedanta."
"The School’s teachings were therefore sufficiently broad, not to say eclectic.
Students moreover were encouraged to read the philosophical and religious classics of both East and West.
In particular, it seems, they were encouraged to read Plato".
The author also states SES regarded the music of Mozart, in particular, as having a positive, spiritualising effect on the mind.
Lingwood concludes "Contact with the School of Economic Science had, in fact, widened his (Delemare) intellectual horizons, and he had much to be thankful to it for".
In 1983, the day before the UK General Election, reporters Peter Hounam and Andrew Hogg, writing in the London Evening Standard, alleged the SES was a cult infiltrating the Liberal Party.
They said it "enforced a severe diet, persecuted women and kept its members closed off from the outside world".
They also criticised the School of Economic Science's links to the St James Independent Schools for children in London and the discipline regime at the children's schools.
The articles were described by SES as "largely politically motivated".
SES leadership initially chose to ignore these allegations.
In 1984, Hounam and Hogg wrote a book, "Secret Cult," which said that the organisation aimed to establish psychological control over its members and had caused personality change, mental breakdown and divorce.
They did not consider every SES member to be a cult member; they excluded, for example, the thousands that attend only the introductory courses and potentially those in the senior echelons that live normal lives; of concern was a group they called the 'lumpenproletariat' who joined after the religious fervour of the 1960s and are "dependant on SES to make decisions in their lives".
They also said the SES was "penetrating the corridors of power" with particular links to the Liberal Party, whose then chairman, Roger Pincham, was an SES member.
The book contained a reply from Pincham disputing allegations, and also included interviews with ex-students who said they had gained much from their attendance.
The authors commented that, in hiding from publicity, the School might have made secrecy its worst enemy.
Critics said the book contained errors and had a political agenda against the Liberal Party, which was undermined when it turned out that the spokesman for the SES, David Boddy, had been a press adviser to Conservative Party leader Margaret Thatcher.
Shaw (1994) said: "the more obvious conclusion" is that members might be "in the cult simply because they shared the elitist upper-middle-class professional values that the school espoused".
Colin Slee, Provost of Southwark Cathedral, who had contributed to the book and saw the organisation as a cult, in 1999 said he had shifted his attitude and saw it as a New Religious Movement instead.
Journalist William Shaw wrote a 1994 book "Spying in Guru Land: Inside Britain's Cults," in which he attended SES along with several other organisations.
"In the whole colourfully eccentric splatter of cults, there has never been one as genteel, stiff-upper lipped and absurdly British as the School of Economic Science.
In many ways, it's quite the strangest cult I join," Shaw said.
He reported that during the introductory course he did not witness brainwashing and that the "...yearning dedication of those who stay, turning up week after week in their quest for the big answer to life, is somehow ignored by those in the anti-cult movement who try to tell us that behind the fluty-voiced Miss Crammond lurks a malicious agent of mind control."
Characterising Leon MacLaren as authoritarian, he described a "regime of holy servitude - part Gurdjieffian discipline, part oriental mysticism, part Christian mysticism, part social snobbery".
Shaw interviewed "Giles", a former SES tutor, who blamed SES for losing two relationships and that he "suffered a complete mental breakdown, during which he says he came very close to suicide."
In 1994 Religious Studies Lecturer at the University of Wolverhampton, George Chryssides wrote: SES does not consider itself to be a religion, it runs classes in philosophy, "by which is meant Vedic philosophy", with some Christian and Esoteric elements, together with the practice of meditation.
It is an exclusively British organisation.
Writing in the Independent in 1995, in an article titled "Philosophy for grown-ups", Hester Lacey described how a diverse group of 50 people attended a philosophy class at SES in London.
Lacey listed the motivations of some of the participants including: "I started coming because I felt there had to be more to life", "You need to take care of your mind and soul", "The class is like being at a big, brilliant dinner party and not being stuck beside one person all evening","As an actor, the more I understand others, the better I can do my job", "I work in a hospital, and these classes are very much like the group therapy sessions we run".
Lacey points out "None of the teachers is paid, and there are no exams; the pupils study simply for the enjoyment of the lessons."
Sociologist of Religion, David V. Barrett, in his 2001 book "The New Believers", based partly on interviews with David Boddy he described SES a not a religion, but at the heart of its teaching having a very distinctive philosophy which draws on elements of Christianity and esoteric origins and beliefs but is largely Eastern.
The path of the SES is "a case of personal development rather than attaining knowledge".
He points out SES follow the teaching of the Shankaracharya because they say "his wisdom, which we have followed, works".
Writing in "the Times" in In 2008, journalist Richard Morrison, observes that SES was behind Oxfordshire arts festival, Art in Action.
He states "I know people who have found the SES to be a helpful and entirely benign influence on their lives; and others who have encountered it and found it weird.
Not for a moment do I expect Art in Action to be anything other than a showcase for high-quality craft skills."
In 2010, Ariel Kiminer of "The New York Times" reported on her attendance of an introductory course at the School of Practical Philosophy, for which 400 people signed up.
She said that passengers on the New York City Subway were familiar with its advertising placard which stated: "This poster can make you happier than any other".
Attendees were "young immigrants and wizened retirees, pretty actresses and tired parents" and that it was touching that "...so many people from so many backgrounds join in the pursuit of wisdom".
She said fellow attendees recounted the effect of the classes on their lives with candour and eloquence, and that the teaching was "not esoteric but practically conventional wisdom."
After the initial meetings, attendance fell off considerably and she started to dread it; however whenever she would lose patience with the instruction, "one of the students would talk about incorporating these lessons into life, and the honesty and eloquence would win me over again."
Commenting on allegations that it is a cult, she said: "If so, it must be an unsuccessful one: no one tried to sign me up for the next course, let alone get me to donate my earthly possessions."
Kiminer stopped attending the course and doing 'The Exercise', and said: "I do still think about what I give my attention to, though.
And I do still feel touched by the enthusiasm of the other students."
In 2011, M. H. Miller of "The New York Observer" considered the organisation's practices to be "obscure bordering on impenetrable", but also describes the central tenets as "through meditation, achievement of happiness and higher self-awareness–the school warns against the pollution of a scattered mind and cautions students to rid themselves of 'unnecessary thoughts'–and the belief in a universal connectedness that can be tapped into".
Quoting former members found through internet forums, the article said that the organisation had caused divorce and child abuse and that its leadership had ingrained sexism and homophobia; also that the organisation seeks to "gain control over students by a slow process of conflating obedience to God with obedience to those who claim to know God–that is, S.E.S. and its "tutors.".
The author says SES "follow a hierarchical structure in which students advance to new levels of study with money and time, but are not told the specifics of what awaits them when they do."
On investigating the attendees to their programs the author notes room was a mix of races and fairly evenly split between men and women, most in their 40s.
The author attended a philosophy class and found it to be sold out, the students motivation for attending included finding "Purpose in life.
A higher level of understanding in my existence" and to "To learn how to live again" 
In his 2012 book "Confusion No More", Vedanta teacher and disciple of Nisargadatta, Ramesh S Baleskar, includes the accounts of a student of the School of Philosophy, the SES branch in Holland.
The student had been at the group for 12 years and describes it as inviting and stimulating resulting in a "complete change in the way I looked at things".The philosophy course is described as involving a "lot of practising, exercises, meditation - a lot of volition", "there were some very clear experiences of peace of mind".
His experiences led him to further explore Advaita.
In his 2013 book "Philosophy for Life: And other dangerous situations", Jules Evans said the SES relationship with an Indian guru was key to its development, because its members "like Plato himself, were trying to invent a religion."
Describing the historical abuse of SES children confirmed in a 2006 report, he said that they often received no sympathy from their parents because of their membership of the "deeply hierarchical organization".
He added that the day schools are today "apparently run a lot better now by professional teachers, attracting the children of well-to-do parents" and that there has been a shift towards the mainstream of society.
Evans also reported that 18-year-old St. James School girls were introduced to older SES members at two specially arranged parties and that Principal Ian Mason and SES Leader Donald Lambie have both married former St. James girls; Evans said that the organisation wanted to encourage in-group marriage to preserve its values, Mason pointed out the women in question were adults in their 20s when married, nevertheless Mason admitted "It's a bit weird."
Evans concluded, "I personally don't think SES is a 'secret cult'.
It has lost its charismatic and authoritarian Leader.
Its membership is declining", "SES seems to me to be an interesting experiment, an interesting attempt to turn Eastern and Western ancient philosophy into a genuine community and way of life".
In 2012, he said SES is "a neo-platonic sect which tries to bring its members closer to a divine union" similar to the communities created by Plato and Pythagoras that had the aim of completely 
transforming personalities, "close to what we would think of today as religious cults".
In 2019, a writer for "The Outline" enrolled in the School of Practical Philosophy introductory course.
She reported that "There was something surreal about leaving work on Thursday evening and taking the subway to a mansion where I would be told a bunch of weird lies."
She read "Secret Cult" midway through the course and commented that "it was hard to square its horror stories with the SPP, which, like a lot of Americanised British things, wasn’t quite as compelling as the original."
The reviewer opined that it seemed strange the SPP had so much money and attributed it to low overhead.
She observed that "teachers are unpaid, students perform custodial work, and the SPP owns its own building."
Comments from members and ex-members.
In 1963, writing in "Land &amp; Liberty", A J Carter describes coming "into contact with one of the most important influences on my development" at SES.
The economics program introduced him to, land-value tax and Progress and Poverty, by which "a vital seed was sown, but it was not yet to flower".
The philosophy course he describes as "directly and indirectly, altered my whole outlook on the deepest aspects of life."
On 26 May 1982, Roger Pincham, who had been a member since 1955, wrote a letter to "The Evening Standard" challenging criticisms made by Hounam and Hogg.
He said that an account based on the views of a few disaffected former or current students, or on reporters’ attendance at programs on two or three occasions, could not present a balanced view.
He said that thousands of students have attended the program over the preceding four decades and most have gathered great value from doing so.
He added that the authors had mischaracterised the relationship between SES, the independent day schools founded by some of its members, and the Liberal Party, suggesting that the journalists had distrusted the organisation simply because it was "new and rather unusual".
Commenting on the book "Secret Cult," SES member and author Brian Hodgkinson responded to its allegation that the program encourages "destroying the personality".
He said that description conceals the actual focus of the teaching, which is to free the mind from the limitations imposed by the ego.
He added that "of course, no actual force was used.
The whole teaching of the school is word of mouth.
Anyone can walk away from a School meeting or event at any time.
Some do!"
Hodgkinson later wrote a history of the SES called "In Search of Truth: The Story of the School of Economic Science," published in 2010.
It included details of its economic and philosophical thought, and examination of positive and negative aspects of the organisation.
In response to reports that some people had become emotionally disturbed while attending the program, he pointed out that such cases may have been caused by "outside circumstances, such as family relationships or careers" or pre-existing mental health problems.
He added, "When they sought help from help from School tutors, the advice given may sometimes have exacerbated the situation, but there have been a great deal more cases where tutors' help has been much appreciated."
In 2019, actress Emily Watson spoke of her upbringing in SES, which she described as "a quasi-religious organisation/cult" where people are "taught to think a certain way about the world, and about yourself, that is very denigrating to the individual and to women."
When Watson took the role for "Breaking the Waves" (1996) the SES "told me to go on my undignified way," which she said she found "terribly painful" but didn't tell anyone, only confiding in her co-star of that film about it in 2018.
She said that she drew from her SES experience for "Chernobyl" in that it explores the resistance to a dogmatic culture: "I related very strongly to that; being within a system where you were supposed to think a certain way and you weren’t really allowed to think any other way.
And breaking out of that is a very, very powerful release in your life."
In 2014 she described the SES central teaching of Advaita Vedanta as "a kind of spiritual communism where everyone is one and the same... which in principle is great but [it was] an organisation that had a lot of problems."
At its day school, she said children were treated with "a sort of emotional cruelty that was utterly out of place in a place of education that purports to be based on love and understanding."
In 2020 she describes SES members as believing “that they are in the one true light and everybody else is in the darkness” and knows “the effect that that has on people’s sense of power and self-worth”.
In her 2002 book, "Nothing Left Over: A Plain and Simple Life", Tionette Lippe, who attend SES in London and New York, describes how she remained in this organisation for a "considerable number of years, studying the philosophy of many of the world’s great traditions, and what I heard and put into practice there laid the groundwork for the rest of my life".
Her own philosophy of wanting to be of service to other people and share with them whatever has comes her way, to live so that supply does not exceed demand or consumption; and to trust that the universe will respond to you in the same way that you respond to it, is of no surprise as she "began my training at a place called the School of Economic Science!".
In a 2006 interview with Oprah Winfrey, actor Hugh Jackman said he had been a member of the School of Practical Philosophy since 1991.
He said, "now I meditate twice a day for half an hour.
In meditation, I can let go of everything.
I'm not Hugh Jackman.
I'm not a dad.
I'm not a husband.
I'm just dipping into that powerful source that creates everything."
In a 2010 interview with GQ Australia, Jackman said: "Really, the spiritual pillar for me has become the School of Practical Philosophy.
I'm a regular attendee there and I suppose that has become my church."
Jackman has stated he is a devout Christian, active in his local Anglican church, but in addition to following this religion he meditates every day and also follows the School of Economic Science, stating "I just find the evangelical church too, well, restrictive.
But the School of Practical Philosophy is nonconfrontational", "We believe there are many forms of scripture", "What is true is true and will never change, whether it's in the Bible or in Shakespeare.
It's about oneness.
Its basic philosophy is that if the Buddha and Krishna and Jesus were all at a dinner table together, they wouldn't be arguing.
There is an essential truth.
And we are limitless."
Jackman has attended SES branches in the US and Australia 
Author of the 2007 book, "There’s No More Dying Then", Stephanie Wilson a consultant Histopathologist at St Mary's Hospital London, was confirmed into the Church of England at an early age and saw Christianity as a good thing.
However, during her career as a junior doctor, doubts started to arise and she found her faith did not answer fundamental questions such as "who am I?"
or "why am I here?".
The exploration of eastern philosophy shed new light on what faith is, and illuminated what she already knew about Christianity.
Wilson says "the effect on me of further exploration of the words of the wise opened the heart and brought light to my mind".
In her 2009 book "The Power Within", MacLaren's secretary Dorine Tolley wrote: "The philosophy course he (MacLaren) had developed over the years had slowly become a life-changing method with all its consequences.
The advertisements were not explicit enough and did not indicate that one’s habitual patterns of life would come under scrutiny.".
"In spite of attempts to malign Leon MacLaren and his methods his critics were vastly outnumbered by his supporters and none of the sceptics have ever been able to explain why so many thousands of discerning people flocked to the school".
In July 2012, political advertiser Jeremy Sinclair CBE, chairman of M&amp;C Saatchi, told "The Drum" that outside of work, his other passion is teaching at the SES.
"The philosophy that I teach is to be useful, and not just about mind expanding," he said.
He added that it has "heavily influenced" his book, "Brutal Simplicity of Thought."
His colleague Tim Bell thought SES gave Sinclair a sense of equilibrium, keeping him well enough balanced that he never got affected by blowups at the agency.
in 2013, Martha Dewing, raised Episcopalian, now an Interfaith Minister, said studying Advaita Vedanta at the School of Practical Philosophy in New York changed the way she saw her inherited faith.
Stating "It opened me up and broadened my perspective" and "I see a bigger Jesus.
I see what he meant rather than what they say he said.".
Dewing's two primary spiritual practices are mantra meditation twice a day, and a heartfelt practice of gratitude.
Comments from SES.
In 2011, invited by a reporter to reply to allegations that SES and its branches are a cult, spokeswoman Monica Vecchio said: "I've known Mr MacLaren for many years," referring to SES leader Leon MacLaren.
"I met him when I was a very young woman in my 20s.
For anybody to call anything Mr MacLaren started a cult is just ridiculous.
I've never met a man who was more a man in the greatest sense of the word than Mr MacLaren was."
In 2012 David Boddy, former SES spokesman and Thatcher press secretary, describes MacLaren as "my first mentor" and "my first real teacher", "He knew things others didn’t appear to know, and he was totally fearless when it came to proclaiming them.
He couldn’t abide ‘experts’ or religion but he did believe that humankind could be lifted out of its torpor and misery by the power of philosophy, or love of wisdom.".
He said "the London Evening Standard sought to brand MacLaren a 'cult leader' because of his Indian connections.", the book led to "severe misunderstanding, and in some cases libel and slander".
He points out that "the School of Economic Science, which has never had a political or religious agenda; it is, in fact, a rather interesting, if somewhat pedantic, philosophical school in the classical Platonic tradition."
According to the SES's 2013 website, its critics "greatly misrepresent the aims and activities of the School, but they have alerted it to the need to provide more information about the way its courses and associated activities progress."
SES representative Ian Mason responded to criticism in Jules Evans’ 2013 book.
He said: "The idea is not to break down the ego for the sake of it, but rather to put you in touch with yourself, to help you distinguish what's real or not, and to nourish and strengthen the mind.
But perhaps there was too unquestioning an attitude to the leader in those earlier years.
People took things that MacLaren said and applied them without intelligence."
About the parties reported by Evans, Mason said, "The balls were a response to requests from young women for opportunities to meet some eligible young men in the SES and were pretty innocent occasions.
I should emphasise that there was no coercion involved."
In a 2013 interview with Voice of America Mason stated that life is a voyage of discovery and deepening understanding and the courses are designed to support this.
The participants are the judges as to the successes of the programs, no certifications are offered, the aim is to liberate people.
It's really about being the best kind of person you can be, knowing your potential.
Notable members.
Notable current members include M&amp;C Saatchi chairman Jeremy Sinclair CBE, actor Hugh Jackman, and Canadian entrepreneur Douglas Freeman.
Notable former members include actress Emily Watson and author Laura Wilson, both of whom were brought up in the SES by their parents; David Boddy, former press secretary to Margaret Thatcher; and Richard Stokes, politician.
Swami Vivekananda and meditation 
Meditation played a very important role in the life and teachings of Swami Vivekananda.
He was interested in meditation from his childhood.
His master Ramakrishna found him a " dhyana - siddha " (expert in meditation).
On 24 December 1892, Vivekananda reached Kanyakumari and meditated for three days on a large rock and took the resolution to dedicate his life to serve humanity.
The event is known as the Kanyakumari resolve of 1892.
He reportedly also meditated for a long time on the day of his death (4 July 1902).
Vivekananda is considered as the introducer of meditation to the Western countries.
In his book "Raja Yoga" and lectures, he widely discussed meditation, its purpose and procedure.
He described "meditation" as a bridge that connects human soul to the God.
He defined "meditation" as a state "when the mind has been trained to remain fixed on a certain internal or external location, there comes to it the power of flowing in an unbroken current, as it were, towards that point."
Meditation in Vivekananda's life.
Meditation, which gives an insight to the depth and breadth of the mystical traditions of India, was developed by Ancient Hindu Sages.
He propagated it to the world through his lectures and practical lessons.
He stressed the need to concentrate on the mind, which is a lamp that gives insight to every part of our soul.
Vivekananda defined meditation, first, as a process of self-appraisal of all thoughts to the mind.
He then defined the next step as to “Assert what we really are — existence, knowledge and bliss — being, knowing, and loving,” which would result in “Unification of the subject and object.”
Vivekananda's meditation is practiced under the two themes of “Meditation according to Yoga” which is considered a practical and mystical approach, and of “Meditation according to Vedanta” which means a philosophical and transcendental approach.
Both themes have the same end objective of realizing illumination through realization of the “Supreme”.
Childhood.
Vivekananda was born on 12 January 1863 in Calcutta (now Kolkata).
From his very childhood, he was deeply interested in meditation and used to meditate before the images of deities such as Lord Shiva, Lord Rama, and Sita.
He was able to practice deep meditation at the age of eight.
In his childhood, when Narendra was playing meditation with his friend, suddenly a cobra appeared, frightening Narendra's friends, who then fled.
But Narendra was absorbed in meditation and did not notice the cobra nor hear his friends' calls.
Youth (1881—1886).
When Vivekananda (then Narendra Nath Dutta) met Ramakrishna in 1881, the latter found Vivekananda "dhyana–siddha" (expert in meditation).
Between 1881 and 1886, as an apprentice of Ramakrishna, he took meditation lessons from him, which made his expertise on meditation more firm.
Narendra wanted to experience "Nirvikalpa Samadhi" (the highest stage of meditation) and so requested Ramakrishna to help him to attain that state.
But Ramakrishna wanted young Narendra to devote to the service of mankind, and told him that desiring to remain absorbed in "Samadhi" was a small-minded desire.
He also assured him that one could go to "a state higher even than that" by serving mankind, because everything is God's own manifestation.
This dictum of Ramakrishna deeply influenced Narendranath.
Experience of "Nirvikalpa Samadhi" in Cossipore Garden House.
Narendranath first experienced "Nirvikalpa Samadhi" at Cossipore Garden House in Calcutta.
One evening, when he was meditating with his friend Gopal (senior), he suddenly felt a light behind his head.
As he concentrated on the light, it became more luminous.
Narendra concentrated further on the light and found it getting subsumed in to "the Absolute".
He became unconscious.
When he regained consciousness after sometime, his first question was "Gopal–da, where is my body?"
Gopal felt worried and informed this event to Ramakrishna.
Meditation at Baranagar Math.
After the death of Ramakrishna in August 1886, Narendra and few other monastic disciples of Ramakrishna converted a dilapidated house at Baranagar into a new "math" (monastery).
There they practiced religious austerities and meditation.
Narendra later reminisced about his days at the Baranagar math: 
Meditation during the Wandering years.
Between 1888 and 1893, Narendranath travelled all over India as a "Parivrajaka Sadhu", a wandering monk, and visited many states and holy sites.
During his tours he always wanted to live in secluded locations where he could stay alone and concentrate on meditation.
During these lonely years, he reportedly gained inspiration from the words of Gautama Buddha—  
&lt;poem&gt;Go forward without a path, 
Fearing nothing, caring for nothing!
Wandering alone, like the rhinoceros!
Even as a lion, not trembling at noises, 
Even as the wind, not caught in the net, 
Even as the lotus leaf, untainted by water, 
Do thou wander alone, like the rhinoceros!&lt;/poem&gt; 
Once when Narendra was meditating under a peepul tree in the Himalayas, he realized the oneness of man and all other objects in the universe and that man was just a miniature of the whole universe, i.e., the human life follows the same rules as applicable for the whole universe.
He wrote about this experience to his brother-disciple Swami Ashokananada.
Kanyakumari resolve of 1892.
Vivekananda reached Kanyakumari on 24 December 1892 and meditated for a three-day stretch, from 25 December to 27 December, on a large mid-sea rock, on aspects of India's past, present, and future.
There he reportedly had a "Vision of one India" and took the resolve to dedicate his life for the service of humanity.
This resolve of 1892 is known as "Kanyakumari resolve of 1892".
Meditation in the West.
In 1893 Vivekananda travelled to the West and participated in the Parliament of the World's Religions, which was held in Chicago in that year.
Between 1893 and 1897, he conducted hundreds of public and private lectures and classes in the United States and England.
Even during these active days he continued meditating on a regular basis, and his hectic work schedule could not disturb his meditations.
Meditation on 4 July 1902.
Vivekananda died a few minutes after 9 pm on 4 July 1902.
Even on that day, he practiced meditation for many hours.
He also sang a devotional song on Hindu goddess Kali.
This was his last meditation.
The Great Swami Vivekananda's teachings on meditation.
Vivekananda is considered as the introducer of meditation to the Western countries.
He realized "concentration is the essence of all knowledge" and meditation plays an important role in strengthening one's concentration.
He said "man-making" was his mission, and he felt for that we needed a composite culture of knowledge, work, love and meditated mind.
He stressed on practicing meditation on regular basis.
Vivekananda told, meditation not only improves one's concentration, but also improves his behavioural control.
Definition of "Dhyana" (meditation).
To Vivekananda, meditation "(Dhyana)" was a bridge that connected human soul to the God, the Supreme.
He defined "Dhyana" meditation as— 
When the mind has been trained to remain fixed on a certain internal or external location, there comes to it the power of flowing in an unbroken current, as it were, towards that point.
This state is called Dhyana.
When one has so intensified the power of Dhyana as to be able to reject the external part of perception and remain meditating only on the internal part, the meaning, that state is called "Samadhi".
Procedure of meditation suggested by Vivekananda.
In the book "Raja Yoga" and several other lectures, Vivekananda also suggested the procedure of meditation.
He said— 
First, to sit in the posture In which you can sit still for a long time.
All the nerve currents which are working pass along the spine.
The spine is not intended to support the weight of the body.
Therefore the posture must be such that the weight of the body is not on the spine.
Let it be free from all pressure.
Vivekananda published a summary of Raja Yoga from Kurma Purana.
In the summary, he defined the meaning, purpose and procedure of meditation.
The procedures of meditation— 
Sit straight, and concentrate on the divine light between the eyebrows that's what he meant by Samprkeshy Nasikagram (ie place between your eyebrows, not on your nose tip).
This whole process of divine meditation can only be initiated by an enlightened master who himself have seen God and can make you see that right at the time of Deeksha.
Later on, we have to concentrate our mind on that divine light.
And after daily practicing, you can attain the oneness with God.
He who has given up all attachment, all fear, and all anger, he whose whole soul has gone unto the Lord, he who has taken refuge in the Lord, whose heart has become purified, with whatsoever desire he comes to the Lord, He will grant that to him.
Therefore worship Him through knowledge, love, or renunciation.
Ki Aikido 
or is a Japanese martial art, a gendai budo (contemporary martial art).
It is part of the martial arts derived from aikido, which appeared after its founder's death in 1969.
It started in early 70's with the creation of the Ki Society of Koichi Tohei, the previous Aikikai's Chief Instructor.
This martial art focuses on mind and body coordination and is based on aikido techniques and Japanese yoga and promote non-violent conflict solving and self-development.
He was taught Shinshin-t%C5%8Ditsu-d%C5%8D (also known as 'Japanese yoga') by Tempu Nakamura.
He felt that Tempu Sensei's teaching and explanation made clear what Morihei Ueshiba was able to do in his aikido (particularly the idea that the mind moves the body).
As a result he started bringing in exercises from Shinshin-t%C5%8Ditsu-d%C5%8D, such as 'unbendable arm' and 'unraisable body' into his aikido teaching.
He started to do this as Chief Instructor of the Aikikai, while Morihei Ueshiba was still alive.
He also felt the concepts of Shinshin-toitsu-do were more clearly applicable to daily life.
It was later that he formalised his style, including leaving out some aikido techniques that he felt were ineffective against a partner who could coordinate mind and body.
Although Tohei Sensei gave the Ki Development aspect of his style the name Shinshin-toitsu-do, it only covered part of Tempu Sensei's curriculum/teaching, and some of it was modified by him.
The teaching of Ki Aikido has been split between different federations, each reflecting the experience of their founders: Ki Society with Koichi Tohei and his son Shinichi Tohei, Ki no Kenkyukai Internationale Association with Kenjiro Yoshigasaki and Ki Federation of Great Britain with Ken Williams (or Kenneth Williams).
Ki Aikido features.
Each federation has evolved its own set, but some common features are:  
4 principles for mind and body coordination.
These principles guide the practitioners to keep "mind and body" coordinated and can be applied in daily life (walking, pushing a door, handling a conflict, ...).
To follow one is to follow all.
To lose one is to lose all.
5 principles for aikido.
These principles also guide the practitioners, when doing aikido techniques.
They roughly represent the state of mind of an aikidoka: being aware of your surroundings, trying to understand what your partner/attacker is trying to do, adjusting your moves to match his moves and lead (no clash, etc..).

Heart Rhythm Meditation 
Heart Rhythm Meditation (commonly known as HRM) is a type of meditation that involves conscious breathing, in which the conscious control of breathing is meant to influence a person’s mental, emotional, or physical state, with a claimed therapeutic effect.
Background.
Heart Rhythm Meditation is a method of meditation that has been expanded and developed by Puran Bair and Susanna Bair from iamHeart.
The method was described in the 1998 book "Living from the Heart", by Puran and Susanna Bair (3rd edition published in 2019) and in the 2007 book "Energize Your Heart in 4 Dimensions", by Puran and Susanna Bair.
The application of Heart Rhythm Meditation to the development of spiritual maturity is described in the book, "Follow Your Heart", by Puran and Susanna Bair, edited and illustrated by Asatar Bair published in 2011.
The practice originates from the Jesus Prayer and the teachings of Inayat Khan, who founded the Sufi order and is credited with bringing Sufism to the Western world.
Puran and Susanna Bair were disciples of Inayat Khan’s eldest son and successor Vilayat Inayat Khan.
The HRM founders claim that their approach is non-religious, practical, and scientific.
Techniques.
The method was described in the 1998 book "Living from the Heart", by Puran Bair (3rd edition published in 2019) and in the 2007 book "Energize Your Heart in 4 Dimensions", by Puran and Susanna Bair.
The method of HRM involves conscious breathing, use of the full lung capacity, a concentration on the heart (both the physical heart and the emotional or poetic heart) and an intervention in the breath to make it rhythmic, through the coordination of the breath and heartbeat.
"The Full Breath" technique expands the vital capacity of the lungs with full and deep breathing, while slowing the breath rate to six breaths per minute or slower.
This synchronizes breath and heartbeat, creating “entrainment,” a coherent pattern of Heart Rate Variability.
Entrainment also decreases production of stress hormones and increases production of anti-stress hormones.
Another pattern, “The Square Breath”, involves a longer holding of the breath, so that the holding period equals the breathing period, for example, 8 beats in, 16 beats hold, 8 beats out.
The "Square Breath" method is applied for stabilizing quality of breathing in order to reduce anxiety or feelings of panic.
Research studies completed by the Heart Math Institute indicate that this sort of entrainment increases parasympathetic nervous system activity, associated with a calm, restful state.
Japamala 
A japamala, , or simply mala (; , meaning 'garland') is a loop of prayer beads commonly used in Indian religions such as Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism, and Buddhism for counting recitations when performing "japa" (reciting a mantra or other sacred sound) or for counting some other "sadhana" (spiritual practice) such as prostrating before a holy icon.
They are similar to other forms of prayer beads used in various world religions (such as misbahahs in Islam) and are sometimes referred to in Christianity as a "rosary".
The main body of a mala is usually 108 beads of roughly the same size and material as each other though smaller versions, often factors of 108 such as 54 or 27, exist.
A distinctive 109th "guru bead", not used for counting, is very common.
Mala beads have traditionally been made of a variety of materials such as wood, stone, seeds, bone and precious metals—with various religions often favouring certain materials—and strung with natural fibres such as cotton, silk, or animal hair.
Mala can nowadays be found which are made from synthetic materials (such as plastic or glass beads, and nylon cords whether braided string or monofilament).
History.
Origin.
The specific origin of the mala is unknown, with the use of beads for counting being a widespread practice in ancient cultures.
No references to malas occur in Chinese literature before the introduction of Buddhism during the Han dynasty, suggesting that the practice spread from India to China and may have originated there.
No mention of a mala occurs in the Agamas or Pali Nikayas, generally regarded as the oldest Buddhist literature, and it is unclear if their use originated with Buddhists or with Brahmins, Jains, or another Indian religious community.
Early attestations.
Malas may appear in early Brahmanic Hindu art as part of the garb of deities or worshippers, but are difficult to distinguish from decorative necklaces or garlands.
The earliest clear depiction of a mala being used as a tool for recitation, rather than possibly being a necklace or decoration, comes from a bodhisattva image created during the 4th - 6th century Northern Wei dynasty in China; the mala is held in the hand, rather than worn.
The first literary reference to the use of a mala for the recitation of mantras comes from the "Mu Huanzi Jing" ( or , "Aristaka/Soap-Berry Seed Scripture/Classic", Taishō Tripiṭaka volume 17, number 786), a Mahayana text purported to have been translated into Chinese during the Eastern Jin era, some time in the 4th - 5th century CE.
No mention of this text occurs in standard bibliographies before the 6th century, but an independent translation in the 8th century suggests an origin as a Sanskrit text transmitted from Central Asia, rather than a Chinese composition.
According to this text, the Buddha instructed a king to make a mala from the seeds of the aristaka plant and recite the Triratana while passing the mala through his fingers in order to calm his mind and relieve his anxiety.
China.
While the earliest Buddhist story about the mala is associated with lay practice, in China it was initially primarily associated with monastic practice.
Images of monks with malas began to appear in China in the 7th century CE and the mala seems to have been regarded as a common piece of monastic equipment by around this era.
While there are relatively few pre-Song Dynasty depictions or references to the mala, this may be due to its use in private religious practice rather than public ceremony.
Chinese authors criticized monks who recited mantras on their malas in public, as monks were generally expected to remain silent while on public alms rounds.
By the Ming Dynasty-era, malas increasingly began to be valued for their aesthetic qualities as much or more than their spiritual use.
Malas of expensive or rare materials became common as gifts given among the wealthy, and the materials allowed to different grades of wives and concubines was regulated by sumptuary laws.
Depictions of Qing Dynasty court officials often include malas, intended to show their status and wealth rather than as an indication of spirituality.
Materials.
A wide variety of materials are used to make mala beads.
Religious groups—notably Hindu Tantra and Vajrayana Buddhism—may favour certain materials in general or may favour certain materials dependent upon the desired effect of the spiritual practice for which the mala is being used.
Common materials are wood from the sandalwood tree or the bodhi tree, and seeds of the lotus plant.
Strings may be made from practically any fibre, traditionally silk or wool or cotton though synthetic monofilaments or cords such as nylon can now be found and are favoured for their low cost and good wear resistance.
Elastic cords, such as milliner's elastic, may be used and have the advantage that they can stretch to fit over the wearer's hand if worn on the wrist whereas other material may not wrap a sufficient number of times to prevent the mala from slipping off.
Beads may also be joined by metal chains.
Mala may also have a tassel hanging from the guru bead.
This tassel need not be made from the same fibre as the string.
Hinduism.
Beads made from the fruitstones of the rudraksha tree are considered sacred by Saivas, devotees of Siva, while beads made from the wood of the tulsi plant are used and revered by Vaishnavas, followers of Vishnu.
Red and black "hakik" may be favoured for tamasic sadhanas, "sphatik" for praying to any "deva", and red "mūnga" stone mainly for praising.
Hindu mala are commonly made with a small knot tied between each bead.
Buddhism.
Crystal, pearl, nacre, or other clear or white in colour beads may be used to count mantras used to appease devas or purify oneself; beads made of gold, silver, copper, or lotus seeds may be used to count mantras intended to increase lifespan, knowledge, or merit; beads made of ground sandal wood, saffron, and other fragrant substances may be used with mantras meant to tame others; mantras aiming at subduing malicious spirits or afflictions may be made from "rudraksha" seeds or human bones; and beads made of bodhi wood can be used for many purposes, for counting all kinds of mantras, as well as other prayers, prostration, circumambulation and so forth.
Tibetan Buddhism.
A general-purpose mala is made from rattan seeds; the beads themselves called "moon and stars" by Tibetans, and variously called "lotus root", "lotus seed" and "linden nut" by various retailers.
The bead itself is very hard and dense, ivory-coloured (which gradually turns a deep golden brown with long use), and has small holes (moons) and tiny black dots (stars) covering its surface.
Some Tibetan Buddhist traditions call for the use of animal bone (most commonly yak), those of past Lamas being the most valuable.
Semiprecious stones such as carnelian and amethyst may be used, as well.
Red coral is highly prized for mala as the colour red is associated with the Padma family of buddhas (who are highly revered in Tibet).
Wooden mala beads may have a shallow trench engraved around their equator into which tiny pieces of red coral and turquoise are affixed.
Due to the cost of already harvested or fossilized red coral and its conservation status, as well as the cost of turquoise, plastic or glass may be used instead.
Nepal.
In Nepal, mala beads are made from the natural seeds of "Ziziphus budhensis", a plant in the family Rhamnaceae endemic to the Temal region of Kavrepalanchok in Bagmati Province.
The Government of Nepal's Ministry of Forestry has established a committee and begun to distribute seedlings of these plant so as to uplift the economic status of the people living in this area.
Number of beads.
There are numerous explanations why there are typically 108 beads, with the number 108 bearing special religious significance in a number of Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain traditions.
For example, in traditional Buddhist thought, people are said to have 108 afflictions or kleshas.
In another reckoning, 108 is the number of possible dharmas or phenomena; despite the varying explanations for the use of this number, the number itself has been kept consistent over centuries of practice.
Smaller malas are also known, most commonly with a factor of 108 beads (such as 54, 27, or 18), and may be worn on the wrist or used to more conveniently keep count of prostrations.
Many mala will have a 109th bead which is variously called the guru, Sumeru, bindu, stupa, or mother bead.
It is often larger or of a distinctive material or colour.
In some Buddhist traditions, the guru bead represents Amitabha or Avalokitesvara.
Guru beads often have two holes drilled in that so that the cord can enter from each side separately but exit together.
A decorative conical bead may rest at the exit point.
Additional beads.
Mala may have extra beads hanging from the guru bead.
Especially when unable to move along the cord because knots hold them in place, these are decorative elements.
They may or may not have religious symbolism (for example, three beads representing the Buddhist Triple Gem of Buddha, Dharma and Sangha) but are not used for counting recitations in any way.
Counting markers and cords.
Tibetan Buddhism can require that a practitioner complete a particular number of repetitions of an activity as a foundational practise or to become eligible for initiation into an esoteric teaching, for example, one may need to complete 100,000 recitations of Vajrasattva mantra.
To aid this, Tibetan Buddhist mala can be made with additional functional beads over and above the 108 main beads.
These beads take two main forms serving two different purposes: three marker beads inline with the 108 beads; two short cords of ten beads each hanging from the main loop.
Inline marker beads.
Three distinctive, often smaller, beads are placed so that, with the guru bead, they divide the regular beads into four sections of 27 beads each.
They allow quick estimation of the fraction of a round completed.
Their presence raises the number of beads (not counting the guru bead) to 111.
Beads on separate cords.
The short cords may either be permanently attached to the mala or they may be obtained separately; they do not need to match the main beads.
These short cords may either be attached individually to the main loop or they may be joined at their common top.
The cords end in small charms, usually a different charm on each, with a dorje and a bell shape being common.
Their cord is thicker than normal so that the beads on them will not slide under their own weight but can be moved by the chanter.
After a single round of chanting, the user will slide up one bead on the cord with the dorje which represents 108 (or 111) recitations.
After ten rounds all ten dorje beads have been moved up, one bead on the bell cord is raised representing 1080 (or 1110) recitations and the dorje beads are all reset to their low position.
To keep track of more recitations, the chanter may use a small metal charm called a "bhum" counter.
("Bhum", approximately pronounced "boom", is Tibetan for "one hundred thousand".)
The "bhum" counter starts next to the guru bead and is attached to the main string by a clip or a slip knot.
When the tenth bell bead has been raised (10 800 or 11 100 recitations), the chanter moves the "bhum" counter to the next space between beads (and resets the beads on the bell cord).
By consistently moving the "bhum" counter in the same direction about 1.2 million recitations can be counted.
Religious usage.
Mantras are typically repeated hundreds or even thousands of times.
The mala is used so that one can focus on the meaning or sound of the mantra rather than counting its repetitions.
In addition to their practical use as an aide in recitation, malas have traditionally been ascribed to have additional spiritual qualities.
Different materials may be ascribed the power to help with different practical or spiritual problems, and the mala itself may be ascribed talismanic characteristics.
In some traditions, malas are consecrated before use in a manner similar to images of deities, through the use of mantras, dharani, or the application of pigment.
Malas purchased from temples and monasteries may have been blessed by the residents of that institution.
Mala may also be blessed after purchase.
Popular folk tales may describe malas as becoming imbued with the power of the many recitations it has been used for, or a mala given by a respected monk may be said to have the power to cure illnesses or to restore fertility to barren individuals.
Carrying and storing.
Mala may be worn by practitioners in several ways: 
However they are worn the wearer is supposed to keep the mala from making contact with the floor or ground.
Mala may be carried in small pouches from which they are removed before use.
Some practitioners, such as members of ISKCON, may carry their malas in larger pouches which hang from the back of the hand and allow the mala to be manipulated while it is being used without it being significantly exposed to public view or risking contact with the ground.
In the home, mala may be stored in a pouch or not.
Some practitioners may store their malas in jewelry boxes or similar containers.
Practitioners who have an altar or shrine in their homes may additionally choose to keep their malas on the altar when not being used or carried.
Method of use.
The loop is draped over the index finger of the right hand (in Hindu practice: Buddhists often use the left hand) and held in place by the right thumb of the first bead next to the guru bead.
As each recitation is completed the loop is advanced by one bead.
Some practitioners will hold their other three fingers next to their index finger so that all four fingers are inside the loop.
Other practitioners will have only their index finger inside the loop, separating this finger from the other three (for similar reasons as in the next paragraph).
Some practitioners will drape the loop over their second finger (with their third and fourth fingers also inside) and use their index finger to move the beads towards the thumb.
This is said to be symbolic of the atma (represented by the index finger) moving towards Paramatma (represented by the thumb) by the vehicle of the mantra (the beads) overcoming elements of the material world (the three other fingers).
The guru bead is not used for counting repetitions; counting for each round begins and ends with either of the beads next to the guru bead.
In the Hindu tradition and some Buddhist traditions, practitioners who undertake more than one round at a time will, rather than moving their fingers across the guru bead, turn the mala around so that the same bead which was used at the end of the previous round becomes the first bead use for the next round.
While there are typically 108 regular beads, some practitioners will count a round as only 100 repetitions to allow for an accidentally skipped bead or an imperfect recitation.
Buddhism.
Japanese Buddhism.
In Buddhism in Japan, Buddhist prayer beads are known as or , where the "o" is the honorific "o-".
Different Buddhist sects in Japan have different shaped "juzu"s, and use them differently.
For example, Shingon Buddhism, Tendai and Nichiren Buddhism may use longer prayer beads with strands on both ends similar to those used in mainland Asia.
During devotional services, these beads may be rubbed together with both hands to create a soft grinding noise, which is considered to have a purifying and reverential effect.
However, in Jōdo Shinshū, prayer beads are typically shorter and held draped over both hands and are not ground together, as this is forbidden.
Jōdo-shū is somewhat unusual because of the use of a double-ringed prayer beads, called , which are used for counting nenbutsu recitations (i.e. recitation of the name of Amitabha Buddha): one ring contains single beads used to count a single recitation while the other ring is used to count full revolutions of the first ring.
Additionally, other beads hang from the strings, which can count full revolutions of the second ring (flat beads), or full revolutions of the first string of beads.
In all, it is possible to count up to 120,000 recitations using these beads.
The design is credited to a follower of Hōnen named Awanosuke.
Regardless of Buddhist sect, prayer beads used by lay followers are frequently smaller, featuring a factor of 108 beads.
It is common to find prayer beads in Japan that contain a small image inside the largest bead, usually something associated with the particular temple or sect.
When held up to the light the image is clearly visible.
Burmese Buddhism.
Theravada Buddhists in Myanmar use prayer beads called "seik badi" ( ), shortened to "badi". 108 beads are strung on a garland, with the beads typically made of fragrant wood like sandalwood, and series of brightly coloured strings at the end of the garland.
It is commonly used in samatha meditation, to keep track of the number of mantras chanted during meditation.
Aesthetic usage.
In recent years, it has become common for non-religious individuals to wear such beads as a fashion accessory with the beads having no religious connotation whatsoever.
Similar practices have been noted since the Ming Dynasty, when malas began to be used as fashionable accessories by members of the Chinese court.
Sumptuary laws regulated the materials of malas in Qing Dynasty-era China.
Opinion is divided as to whether a mala that is worn as decoration can also be used for the practise of japa or if two separate malas are required.
Buddhist practise would refrain from ostentatious display of a mala, whether as a show of wealth or a claim of piety.
As a self-reminder of one's beliefs or a non-invasive symbol that may inspire others to follow the dharma they may be acceptable.
Peace Revolution 
Peace Revolution is an online meditation platform aimed at young adults.
The platform's primary focus is on the teaching of Samatha meditation but is also involved in other activities and events related to mindfulness and peace-building.
Although the platform has a secular orientation, it does draw on principles of Buddhism.
Buddhist monks from Thailand are often invited to lead meditation and mindfulness activities.
The idea the platform is built on is that sustainable world peace can only be established by first achieving mindfulness, or "inner peace", at the individual level; after which peace can be achieved at the community level and greater.
This is expressed through Peace Revolution's slogan "Peace In, Peace Out" (PIPO).
Peace Revolution offers a number of offline and online activities and programs to facilitate this goal.
History.
Peace Revolution was established in 2008 by the World Peace Initiative Foundation, a non-profit organization which operates mainly from Thailand.
The initial idea for the creation of the website was that with current developments in modern education, the focus on mental well-being had become less important.
With a growing availability of Internet connections throughout the world, meditation could be easily introduced in this way.
The platform is known for introducing meditation as a secular hobby for people in regions where meditation is not widely known.
The World Peace Initiative and Peace Revolution have partnerships with several organizations internationally, including the European Commission.
the platform had 87,521 participants, from 235 countries and territories and had organized 104 events worldwide.
Peace Revolution's operations are maintained by a worldwide network connected through their website.
Activities.
Online meditation program.
Peace Revolution runs a forty-two-day online self-development program based on its "Peace In, Peace Out" philosophy, which focuses on meditation, daily self-discipline to deepen meditation experiences, and other activities for self-reflection.
Subject matter discussed include incorporating meditation into one's daily life, the relation between body and mind, the training of habits, karma, a culture of peace and conflict resolution.
Meditation, referred to as "Inner Peace Time" on the platform, makes up the central theme of Peace Revolution's activities.
The meditation technique used on the platform is Dhammakaya meditation.
Several online meditation resources are available on the Peace Revolution website, including a written walk-through on meditation and guided meditations in various languages.
Optional offline components of the program include special assignments which the participants complete in their own surroundings, called "Special Ops".
Such activities include inviting others to meditate, and collaborative art or community service projects with the theme of inner peace.
Other activities.
Peace Revolution offers numerous fellowships hosted around the world.
Peace Revolution Fellowships typically range from three to fourteen days and include a meditation retreat.
The platform is also active in various Peace Summits across the world, often in partnership with local organizations.
Summits typically last four days and feature numerous guest speakers from the World Peace Initiative Foundation, as well as speakers from different like-minded organizations from the region.
The topics typically discussed in the peace summits include peace-building, specific issues related to the region, and the benefits of meditation in these peace-building processes.
In addition to these summits, Peace Revolution also sponsors events for participants who wish to organize their own meditation events and workshops in their local areas, providing meditation instructors and assisting participants in organizing their events.
Instructors provided include Buddhist monks and certified meditation instructors of different backgrounds.
Such events are referred to as "Peace on Demand" events (also called a event).
Peace Revolution's first "Peace on Demand" event was held in Egypt in 2010 during the International Day of Peace.
In the following years, numerous local events have been organized worldwide, with events being held in forty-six different countries Peace Revolution sponsored events have been held in various settings, such as for companies to provide training for its employees, and in universities, schools and prisons.
Notable events.
Some events that Peace Revolution has sponsored or helped coordinate are meditation workshops in refugee camps for African children and a broadcast on Albanian national television.
Other examples are a vigil in Muea-Buea, Cameroon, to commemorate victims after a bombing of the Boko Haram in 2015, and guided meditation that took place during a film festival emphasizing human rights in Barcelona.
Peace Revolution volunteers have also organized peace walks to promote their message.
From 2018 onward, a yearly meditation week was organized in Argentina, in which guided meditations were organized in public spaces, educational institutions, hospitals, companies and prisons.
This was done in cooperation with the New Future Society, based in the USA and Argentina.
Branded as the "#MEME Marathon de la Calma" ('Marathon of Calm'), the event is organized in cooperation with government officials from the province and municipalities.
Structure.
Although Peace Revolution and its programs are run by full-time employees based at its headquarters, the organization relies heavily on a large network of volunteers worldwide to organize its programs and events.
Online members are referred to as "Peace Rebels", which according to the website, is because every revolution is made up of rebels and the participants make up the Peace Revolution.
Participants are connected through the website's online networking platform, the Rebel Hub, where Peace Rebels can communicate and plan mindfulness-based projects and ideas, and an online forum where they can discuss their meditation experiences.
Questions about meditation are answered online by "Peace Coaches".
Active members who meet certain requirements can undergo training to become certified meditation instructors, known as "Peace Architects".

Mindfulness-based pain management 
Mindfulness-based pain management (MBPM) is a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) providing specific applications for people living with chronic pain and illness.
Adapting the core concepts and practices of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), MBPM includes a distinctive emphasis on the practice of 'loving-kindness', and has been seen as sensitive to concerns about removing mindfulness teaching from its original ethical framework.
It was developed by Vidyamala Burch and is delivered through the programs of Breathworks.
It has been subject to a range of clinical studies demonstrating its effectiveness.
Origins.
MBPM was developed by Vidyamala Burch, growing out of her experience of chronic pain, her practice of Buddhist meditation, and her work with medical experts in pain management.
Having suffered several accidents in her early life which, alongside a congenital spine condition, left her with severe long-term pain and partial paraplegia, Burch turned to meditation initially as a way to escape her bodily experience, after having been introduced to visualization practice during a long hospital stay in her mid-20s.
Eventually, after encountering the Triratna Buddhist Community, she became a practicing Buddhist, and moved from New Zealand to the UK to live full-time in a residential Buddhist community.
In the late-1990s she suffered a further collapse in her health, confining her to home for long periods and requiring her to start using a wheelchair, which led her to re-evaluate her meditation practice.
Burch realized that "my approach was out of balance: Too much striving and not enough acceptance."
She read widely about pain management and the emerging secular mindfulness movement, and eventually began teaching a course in meditation for people with chronic pain and illness in Manchester.
In 2004, she co-founded the organization Breathworks, which delivers MBPM programs.
Philosophically, the origins of MBPM lie in the Buddha's teachings about suffering, mindfulness, and loving-kindness.
The "core theoretical basis" of MBPM is the distinction between "primary" and "secondary" suffering, as explicated in the Buddha's parable of the two arrows in the Sallatha Sutta.
According to this parable, while primary suffering or the unpleasant physical sensations that "come with being human" are inevitable, secondary suffering, which arises from mental "resistance and aversion", is not.
MBPM programs train participants in kindly present-moment acceptance of primary suffering, leading to the diminishment or disappearance of secondary suffering.
Initially, training focuses on the cultivation of focused attention and mindfulness of the present moment, and its transient character, through meditation, as taught in the Satipatthana Sutta.
The training develops towards and is framed by an emphasis on the cultivation of loving-kindness, as outlined in the Brahma Viharas.
This takes place both through explicit loving-kindness practices utilizing the imagination, and through bringing an attitude of kindliness and compassion to meditation practice and daily life as a whole.
Although the underlying principles of MBPM are drawn from Buddhism, it is presented in secular language accessible to all and suitable for a modern healthcare intervention.
The scientific origins of MBPM lie in academic literature on pain and the medical benefits of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs).
In particular, MBPM grows out of new scientific understandings of pain that developed in the second half of the 20th century, which showed the complexity of the experience of pain and "the extent to which it involves the whole person—the mind as well as the body".
The well-established "gate control theory", for instance, suggests that the experience of pain is connected with the operation of neural "gateways" that are affected by "emotional states, mental activity, and where attention is focused".
These become persistently opened in people with chronic pain, even where underlying tissue damage has healed or is absent.
Modern pain management draws on these understandings in the biopsychosocial model of pain, which holds that pain is best managed through a multifaceted approach addressing the biological, psychological, and social aspects of a patient's life.
MBPM is intended to form one part of a multifaceted pain management program, based on the understanding that mindfulness and meditation may reduce the experience of pain through calming the "mental, physical, emotional, and nervous systems, allowing them to return to a state of balance."
This is based on extensive research indicating that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) including mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) can result in clinically significant reductions in pain, in addition to other health benefits.
Content and delivery.
MBPM is delivered primarily through the Breathworks Mindfulness for Health course, which is structured according to a "six stage process" corresponding with practices taught at different stages of the course.
The process is as follows: 
The course begins by establishing basic meditation skills – in particular the ability to apply focused awareness ("Samatha") to physical, mental, and emotional experience – then goes on to train participants in the cultivation of a broader, non-reactive awareness ("Vipassanā"), and the bringing an attitude of compassion and kindliness ("Metta") to oneself and others.
In addition to learning various forms of meditation – which constitute the core of the course – participants engage in mindful movement, diary-based activity management, three-minute "breathing spaces", and habit-releasing practices.
The course takes place over eight weeks, with weekly classes lasting 2.5 or 3 hours, and participants required to practice 20 minutes of meditation per day at home, as well as other short practices.
In addition to the Breathworks Mindfulness for Health course, the MBPM approach has been adapted for those suffering primarily from stress in the Breathworks Mindfulness for Stress course.
MBPM courses draw many practices and concepts from mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), but provide specific applications for those living with chronic pain, illness, or other forms of suffering.
The three core practices of MBSR – the body scan, breath awareness meditation, and yoga – are all utilized in MBPM, but MBPM meditations are shorter and MBPM movement practice involves cultivating body awareness during simple, non-challenging movements.
Like MBCT, MBPM places emphasis on working with difficult thoughts and emotions and on mindfulness in daily life, but MBPM incorporates a pacing program drawn from pain management practice, and involves a distinctive emphasis on the concepts of primary and secondary suffering.
According to many observers, the most notable distinction between MBPM and other mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) is its emphasis on loving-kindness, which is manifested in its stress on bringing kindliness and compassion to all forms of meditative awareness, in its teaching of loving-kindness practices utilizing the imagination, and in its six-stage process progressing from the individual to the interpersonal and collective aspects of human experience.
This emphasis has been connected by some observers with a sensitivity to concerns about removing mindfulness teaching from its original ethical framework within Buddhism, while at the same time providing a secular evidence-based approach appropriate for people of all faiths, and none.
Evaluation of effectiveness.
In addition to extensive evidence indicating the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) in general for pain management, and further evidence indicating the effectiveness of compassion-based practices for pain, a range of studies have specifically supported the effectiveness of Breathworks Mindfulness for Health MBPM programs for the management of chronic pain and other long-term conditions.
A 2010 study found that chronic pain patients participating in a Breathworks MBPM program reported significantly higher levels of wellbeing than those in the control group, with significant positive changes in catastophizing, depression, outlook, pain self-efficacy, and mindful attention, along with particularly large improvements in pain acceptance.
(Catastrophizing has been found to be a particularly important predictor of quality of life in those with chronic pain.)
A randomized controlled trial in 2013 found that chronic pain patients participating in an MBPM program experienced improvements in their mental health and perceived control of pain symptoms, as well as exhibiting physical changes in brain regions associated with cognitive control and emotional regulation.
Long-term qualitative studies with MBPM course participants suffering from chronic pain and other long-term conditions found significant sustained improvements in quality of life, pain acceptance, and self-directed self management, with one study finding benefits sustained up to nine years after course completion. 2018 studies conducted in Brazil and Spain found significant lasting improvements in pain and quality of life among musculoskeletal pain and cancer patients.
A 2018 literature review found that research on Breathworks MBPM courses has shown them "to be very helpful for people with severe chronic pain and illness", while also noting that further randomized controlled trials were needed.
In addition to research indicating the effectiveness of MBPM as delivered through the Breathworks Mindfulness for Health course, the effectiveness of MBPM as delivered through the Breathworks Mindfulness for Stress course and online Breathworks courses has also been supported by a number of studies.
Breathworks 
Breathworks CIC is an international mindfulness organization founded in the United Kingdom, which offers mindfulness-based approaches to living well with pain, stress, and illness.
It is known particularly for developing the approach of mindfulness-based pain management (MBPM), which shares many elements with mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) but is adapted specifically for those living with chronic pain and illness, and incorporates a distinctive emphasis on the practice of 'loving-kindness'.
Breathworks is a registered Community Interest Company (CIC) in the United Kingdom, and has nearly 500 accredited teachers working in 35 countries.
History.
Breathworks was founded in 2004 by Vidyamala Burch, Sona Fricker, and Gary Hennessey, growing out of a 2001 pilot scheme funded by a grant from the UK's Millennium Commission.
This grant supported Burch to receive training from Jon Kabat-Zinn in mindfulness-based stress reduction, and enabled her to begin a "Peace of Mind" course in Manchester that used mindfulness and loving-kindness meditations to help those suffering from chronic pain.
Drawing on her own experience of severe long-term back pain and partial paraplegia, Burch emphasized the need to turn towards difficult experiences with acceptance and kindness rather than continually struggling to defeat or overcome them.
The pilot course received a positive response from participants, and was inundated with inquiries.
An ordained member of the Triratna Buddhist Order, Burch worked with other members of the Order to found Breathworks, and initially focused the organization on creating a community of trainers who could share the "Peace of Mind" program more widely.
Current work.
Subsequent to its foundation in 2004 Breathworks has grown rapidly, playing an active role in the UK mindfulness teaching community and establishing an international presence.
In 2005 Breathworks was a founding member of the UK Network of Mindfulness-Based Teacher Training Organisations (later renamed the British Association of Mindfulness-based Approaches, or BAMBA), and since then has adhered to this organization's Good Practice Guidelines for training mindfulness teachers and delivering courses.
The majority of Breathworks trainers and teachers now come from a very wide range of professions and backgrounds and Breathworks is clear that, while drawing on contemplative training derived from Buddhism, it offers a secular mindfulness pathway appropriate to a wide range of applications.
Breathworks established its Teacher Training Pathway in 2005, and by 2019 there were almost 500 accredited Breathworks teachers working in 35 countries, reaching 11,000 people.
Breathworks is a registered Community Interest Company in the UK, meaning that its profits are used to provide bursaries and scholarships for its programs through the Breathworks Foundation charity.
Breathworks now offers a range of mindfulness programs catering to people with varied needs and circumstances.
The "Peace of Mind" program evolved into the 8-week Mindfulness for Health course, which in 2015 was delivered to over 800 people in the UK.
This course is aimed primarily at those suffering from chronic pain and illness, and is the main vehicle through which Breathworks delivers mindfulness-based pain management (MBPM).
A parallel 8-week course for those suffering primarily from stress - the Mindfulness for Stress course - was developed by Gary Hennessey, and in 2015 was delivered to over 1000 people in the UK.
Breathworks also offers bespoke Mindfulness in the Workplace programs.
In 2020 Breathworks began offering live online versions of its Teacher Training, Mindfulness for Health, Mindfulness for Stress, and Mindfulness in the Workplace programs, allowing it to continue to reach significant numbers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Mindfulness-Based Pain Management (MBPM).
Breathworks is known particularly for developing the approach of mindfulness-based pain management (MBPM).
Drawing on the experience of Breathworks co-founder Vidyamala Burch, MBPM adapts the core concepts and practices of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) to create a program specifically tailored to those living with chronic pain and illness.
In addition to using shorter meditations and integrating a pacing program into the course, MBPM includes a distinctive emphasis on the concepts of "primary" and "secondary" suffering, and on the practice of "loving-kindness".
Utilizing a "six-step process" oriented towards the cultivation of qualities such as awareness, acceptance, sympathetic joy, equanimity, loving-kindness, and choice, MBPM has been seen as sensitive to concerns about the dangers of removing mindfulness teaching from its original ethical framework, while also providing a secular evidence-based approach appropriate for people of all faiths, and none.
MBPM is delivered primarily through the Breathworks Mindfulness for Health course, but has also been adapted to those suffering from stress in the Mindfulness for Stress course.
A 2018 literature review found that research on the Mindfulness for Health and Stress courses has shown them "to be very helpful for people with severe chronic pain and illness", but also noted that further randomized controlled trials were needed.
Breathworks Foundation 
The Breathworks Foundation is a registered charity in the United Kingdom that aims to broaden access to mindfulness and compassion training.
It provides bursaries enabling people in financial hardship to access the programs of Breathworks CIC, develops partnerships with charities and community groups to expand the delivery of mindfulness training, and initiates research projects investigating the efficacy of Breathworks programs.
It was founded by Vidyamala Burch and is advised by a group of academic experts.
British Association of Mindfulness-Based Approaches 
The British Association of Mindfulness-Based Approaches (BAMBA) is a UK-based network of mindfulness organizations and teachers, which has been described as "the lead organisation overseeing the quality of mindfulness-based training in the UK."
Founded in 2005 as the UK Network of Mindfulness-Based Teacher Training Organisations, BAMBA's original members were the mindfulness centers at the universities of Oxford, Bangor, and Exeter, as well as Breathworks CIC and NHS Scotland.
The primary purpose of the organization is to support and develop good practice and integrity in the delivery of mindfulness-based approaches in the UK.
It does this principally through the maintenance and dissemination of its Good Practice Guidelines, which provide a standards framework for its member organizations, and through the maintenance of a regulated list of accredited mindfulness teachers in the UK, who have been independently verified as having trained with a BAMBA member organization and as adhering to BAMBA Good Practice Guidelines.
The independently verified teachers list has been called "an international first", and BAMBA has been described as "the closest thing that currently exists to a regulatory body for mindfulness training" in the UK.
As of June 2020, BAMBA had 25 member organizations.
Full Catastrophe Living 
Full Catastrophe Living: Using the Wisdom of Your Body and Mind to Face Stress, Pain, and Illness is a book by Jon Kabat-Zinn, first published in 1990, revised in 2013, which describes the mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program developed at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center's Stress Reduction Clinic.
In addition to describing the content and background of MBSR, Kabat-Zinn describes scientific research showing the medical benefits of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), and lays out an approach to mind-body medicine emphasizing the depth of the interconnections between physical and mental health.
The book has been called "one of the great classics of mind/body medicine", and has been seen as a landmark in the development of the secular mindfulness movement in the United States and internationally.
Background.
"Full Catastrophe Living" grew out of the work of the University of Massachusetts Medical Center's Stress Reduction Clinic, founded in 1979 by Jon Kabat-Zinn.
The purpose of the Clinic was to "serve as a referral service for physicians and other health providers, to which they could send medical patients with a wide range of diagnoses and conditions who were not responding completely to more traditional treatments, or who were 'falling through the cracks' in the health care system altogether and not feeling satisfied with their medical treatments and outcomes."
The Clinic's Stress Reduction and Relaxation Program, later renamed mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), aimed to help patients by providing a relatively intensive training in mindfulness meditation and mindful hatha yoga.
This was done through an eight-week course, which, in the words of Kabat-Zinn, 
Kabat-Zinn composed "Full Catastrophe Living" with aim of capturing "the essence and spirit of the MBSR curriculum as it unfolds for our patients", while at the same time articulating "the dharma that underlies the curriculum, but without ever using the word 'Dharma' or invoking Buddhist thought or authority, since for obvious reasons, we do not teach MBSR in that way."
Kabat-Zinn recalls his desire for the book to "embody ... the dharma essence of the Buddha's teachings" in a way that was "accessible to mainstream Americans", and to avoid "as much as possible the risk of it being seen as Buddhist, 'New Age,' 'Eastern Mysticism' or just plain 'flakey.
In this connection, Kabat-Zinn experienced internal conflict over whether to include a letter of endorsement from Thich Nhat Hanh in the book's first edition, which was published in 1990.
Kabat-Zinn felt that the letter "spoke deeply and directly to the essence of the original vision and intention of MBSR", but was also mindful that it "used the very foreign word "dharma" not once, but four times".
Nhat Hanh's letter read as follows: 
Eventually, Kabat-Zinn decided to include the letter in his book as a preface, judging that by 1990 "there was no longer as big a risk of our work being identified with a 'lunatic fringe, due to the scientific evidence that had already emerged for MBSR's efficacy, as well as the accelerating interpenetration of the so-called "counter-culture" with America's mainstream culture.
Publication.
"Full Catastrophe Living" was first published in 1990 and went through numerous reprintings, before eventually being reissued in a revised second edition in 2013.
The second edition refines the meditation instructions and descriptions of mindfulness-based approaches found in the first edition, and also reflects the "exponential" growth of scientific research into mindfulness and its clinical applications in the two decades after the book was first published.

The title "Full Catastrophe Living" is derived from the film "Zorba the Greek", in which the title character says, in response to being asked whether he has ever married, "Am I not a man?
Of course I've been married.
Wife, house, kids ... the "full catastrophe"".
According to Kabat-Zinn: 
Kabat-Zinn has written that his editor for the first edition of the book was concerned that including the word "catastrophe" in the title might "repel potential readers right from the start."
However, Kabat-Zinn found that the phrase "Full Catastrophe Living" "just kept coming back", as it seemed to touch on "something very special that lies within us, our capacity for embracing the actuality of things, often when it seems utterly impossible, in ways that are healing and transforming, even in the face of the full catastrophe of the human condition."
Summary.
Introduction.
In the introduction to the revised edition of 2013, Kabat-Zinn defines mindfulness, reflects on the massive growth of MBSR and other mindfulness-based practices since the publication of the first edition in 1990, and lays out the findings of relevant scientific studies.
He defines mindfulness operationally as "the awareness that arises by paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally", while noting that "when we speak of mindfulness, it is important to keep in mind that we equally mean heartfulness ...
It is a more-than-conceptual knowing.
It is more akin to wisdom, and to the freedom a wisdom perspective provides."
He emphasizes that mindfulness involves accessing within ourselves capacities that we in fact already possess, "finding, recognizing, and making use of that in us which is already okay, already beautiful, already whole by virtue of our being human—and drawing upon it to live our lives as if it really mattered how we stand in relationship to what arises, whatever it is."
While stressing that "mindfulness has its own internal logic and poetry", he suggests that scientific research showing its beneficial effects for health and well-being may provide extra incentive to follow the MBSR curriculum.
He highlights, among other research, studies using fMRI technology to show significant beneficial changes in the brain subsequent to MBSR training.
Part I: The Practice of Mindfulness.
Kabat-Zinn begins this section by laying out what he sees as the foundational attitudes necessary for mindfulness practice.
The attitudes Kabat-Zinn identifies – non-judging, patience, beginner's mind, trust, non-striving, acceptance, and letting go – reflect his grounding in Zen Buddhism.
In particular, Kabat-Zinn emphasizes the non-instrumental nature of mindfulness practice, as in his explication of "non-striving": 
Kabat-Zinn's Zen training is also evident in his emphasis on non-duality, as in his explication of "non-judging", in which he stresses the limitations of all mental categorizations and judgements.
The remainder of the section is devoted to a detailed description of the various meditation practices taught in the MBSR course.
These practices reflect a Theravada or vipassana influence, in that they emphasize the systematic investigation of various aspects of present-moment experience.
Kabat-Zinn describes at length the practices of the body scan, mindfulness of breathing, and mindful hatha yoga, as well as other practices such as walking meditation and mindfulness of daily activities such as eating.
He also narrates the stories of various MBSR participants and their experiences with the practices.
For instance, he tells the story of "Mary", for whom the body scan precipitated a transformative encounter with physical tensions connected with traumatic experiences from childhood, and that of a young woman for whom the walking meditation proved to be the key to overcoming her extreme anxiety.
Part II: The Paradigm.
In this section Kabat-Zinn lays out the theoretical basis for his approach to health and healing, emphasizing the concepts of "wholeness" and "interconnectedness".
He summarizes this approach, which he associates with mind-body and integrative medicine, as follows: 
Kabat-Zinn goes on to lay out the extensive scientific evidence for the close interconnection between mental and physical processes, examining the impact that attitudes such as optimism or pessimism, self-efficacy, hardiness, sense of coherence, and anger can have on physical conditions including cancer and heart disease.
He also extends the concept of wholeness to stress the intimate interconnectedness of all living and non-living phenomena, approvingly quoting a letter from Albert Einstein stating that the human sense of being "something separated from the rest" is "a kind of optical delusion of consciousness".
Part III: Stress.
In this section Kabat-Zinn lays out a range of scientific evidence relating to the psychological and physiological effects of stress, then goes on to describe how mindfulness practice can alleviate these effects.
Drawing on the work of Richard Lazarus and Susan Folkman, he defines psychological stress in terms of the relationship between a person and their environment, which in this case is perceived as taxing or threatening.
Kabat-Zinn examines both the prevalence and the deleterious effects of chronic stress within modern societies, noting that many of the automatic stress reactions common to human beings are poorly adapted to the types of problems modern people most often face.
He writes: 
Habitual maladaptive reactions to stressors can include physical tensions, workaholism, addiction to various chemicals, drugs, or foods, and depressive rumination.
Kabat-Zinn describes how mindfulness practice can help people to overcome such maladaptive reactions by bringing them into awareness, "allowing you to engage in and influence the flow of events and your relationship to them at those very moments when you are most likely to react automatically, and plunge into hyperarousal and maladaptive attempts to keep things under some degree of control."
Mindful awareness, Kabat-Zinn writes, allows us to respond to stressors wisely rather than reacting automatically, helping us to deal with stressors more effectively while also bringing "the comfort of wisdom and inner trust, the comfort of being whole."
Part IV: The Applications.
In this section Kabat-Zinn offers detailed advice for practicing mindfulness in the face of a range of specific stressors, including medical symptoms, emotional disturbance, time and work pressures, relationship issues, and stress relating to political or world events.
Reflecting MBSR's origins in a medical clinic, significant space is devoted to considerations relevant to people suffering from chronic pain and other long-term health conditions.
Kabat-Zinn notes that MBSR's approach to pain seems counter-intuitive to many people, as it does not involve trying to get rid of it or distracting the mind from it, but rather involves accepting and investigating the pain with compassionate attention.
He writes: 
Kabat-Zinn describes how paying attention to pain in this way can help people to identify with it less – to see a headache as "just "a" headache" rather than ""my" headache" – and to overcome habitual maladaptive mental and physical reactions that, in the case of chronic pain in particular, can play a significant role in both the intensity and the salience of pain experiences.
Kabat-Zinn describes various scientific studies showing the significant benefits of mindfulness practice for chronic pain sufferers, and illustrates these findings with the stories of MBSR patients.
Reception and influence.
Subsequent to its publication "Full Catastrophe Living" became a global bestseller.
It has been described as a "landmark" and a "classic" in the fields of mind-body medicine and secular mindfulness, and has been cited in scholarly works more than 11,000 times.
The book is generally seen as the foundational text of the mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program, which is offered in more than 740 hospitals, clinics, and stand-alone programs worldwide.
"Full Catastrophe Living" has also been credited with an important role in inspiring the development of other mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), including mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) and mindfulness-based pain management (MBPM).
Negative visualization 
Negative visualization or futurorum malorum præmeditatio (Latin, literally, pre-studying bad future) is a method of meditative praxis or askēsis by visualization of the worst-case scenario(s).
The method originated with the Cyreanic philosophers and was later adopted by Stoic philosophers.
The technique was made popular with publications of Seneca the Younger's "Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium".
It is thought to have been one of the common forms of Stoic spiritual exercises.
Unlike the general focus of creative visualization of inducing an imaginary positive psychological and physiologic response, negative visualization focuses on training the practitioner on the negative outcomes of realistic life scenarios to desensitize or create psychological fitness in preparation for real-life losses and also to induce feelings of gratitude towards the real things or actual status that the practitioner has.
The severeness of negative visualization range from as mild as thinking of a minor inconvenience, e.g. having to abandon a minor pleasure, to as severe as total immersion in an imagined scenario in which the worst fear(s) of the practitioner has (have) really occurred, e.g. the loss of resources, status or life.
In the 21st century, inspired by English translations of Seneca's "Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium", several Anglophone Stoics coined the expression "negative visualization" and gave it the Dog-Latin expression "premeditatio malorum", often without providing citations.
Before that, the expression "negative visualization" had negative connotations of being the opposite of rhetorical or self-help creative visualization.
According to accounts of some modern Stoics, negative visualization has been adopted by cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and similar psychosocial approaches to psychotherapy, a claim supported by some licensed psychologists although it has mostly been adopted by pop psychologists in the Anglosphere.
Modern Stoics advise practicing negative visualization daily at a set time, such as early in the morning or late at night.
In the "Meditations" of Marcus Aurelius Book II.I, the author recommends to himself that he performs the following negative visualization in the early morning: 
Betimes in the morning say to thyself, This day I shalt have to do with an idle curious man, with an unthankful man, a railer, a crafty, false, or an envious man; an unsociable uncharitable man.
All these ill qualities have happened unto them, through ignorance of that which is truly good and truly bad.
But I that understand the nature of that which is good, that it only is to be desired, and of that which is bad, that it only is truly odious and shameful: who know moreover, that this transgressor, whosoever he be, is my kinsman, not by the same blood and seed, but by participation of the same reason, and of the same divine particle; How can I either be hurt by any of those, since it is not in their power to make me incur anything that is truly reproachful? or angry, and ill affected towards him, who by nature is so near unto me? for we are all born to be fellow-workers, as the feet, the hands, and the eyelids; as the rows of the upper and under teeth: for such therefore to be in opposition, is against nature; and what is it to chafe at, and to be averse from, but to be in opposition?
Mortality salience.
Seneca's "Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium" advise Lucilius Junior to meditate on death.
Later, Epictetus was reported by his students in his "Discourses" to advise reminding oneself of the impermanent nature of things and the mortality of living beings.
"Memento mori" (Latin 'remember death'), or contemplation of death, is considered by the Stoics to be one form of negative visualization, since it trains the practitioner of the inevitability of death, whether that of the practitioner, of one's loved ones, or of everyone.
The Story of Yoga 
The Story of Yoga: From Ancient India to the Modern West is a cultural history of yoga by Alistair Shearer, published by Hurst in 2020.
It narrates how an ancient spiritual practice in India became a global method of exercise, often with no spiritual content, by way of diverse movements including Indian nationalism, the Theosophical Society, Swami Vivekananda's coming to the west, self-publicising western yogis, Indian muscle builders, Krishnamacharya's practice in Mysore, and pioneering teachers like B. K. S. Iyengar.
The book has been received warmly by critics in the western world, who found it erudite, informative and well-written.
In India, "The Hindu" found it a readable account of how an ancient path to enlightenment had become a profitable wellness industry, while the "Hindustan Times" considered that Shearer had an agenda to argue that western body-yoga was unrelated to Indian spiritual yoga.
Context.
Alistair Shearer is a cultural historian of India; he was a lecturer at SOAS.
He teaches meditation and has co-founded a retreat hotel in Kerala, South India.
Book.
Content.
The book is divided into two parts, with some 350 pages of narrative in 30 chapters.
The first part steps through the history of yoga, from ancient times onwards, in 19 chapters.
The older history covers the origins of yoga from around 500 BC, the forest sages, Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, the yoga of the "Bhagavad Gita", yoga in Islamic India and under the British Raj, and the impact of Indian nationalism.
The modern history covers the Theosophical Society, Swami Vivekananda's coming to the west, "roguey yogis" like Pierre Bernard, muscle builders such as K. V. Iyer, yoga at the Mysore Palace with Krishnamacharya, and pioneering teachers who brought yoga to the west, including B. K. S. Iyengar.
The story then moves on to yoga for women, and pioneering female practitioners or yoginis such as Indra Devi.
The part concludes with an account of pioneers like Yogananda, and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi with his Transcendental Meditation.
The 11 chapters of the second part describe yoga "today", including both what Shearer calls "body-yoga" (physical practices, mainly the yoga poses called asanas) and "mind-yoga" (meditational practices).
Body-yoga is introduced with an account of Bikram Yoga, the science of yoga, yoga teacher training, the British Wheel of Yoga, Yogendra and Kuvalayananda's attempts to treat yoga as science, and Sivananda Yoga.
Mind-yoga is covered with discussion of the concepts of Patanjali-style meditation and Mindfulness.
The book concludes with coverage of the rapid growth in yoga's worldwide popularity, the sex scandals affecting yoga gurus, commercialisation by companies such as Lululemon, and some of the many schools and hybrids of yoga.
The book looks at the question of whether body-yoga is spiritual or secular, along with India's political creation of an annual International Day of Yoga.
Illustrations.
"The Story of Yoga" is illustrated with 27 colour plates, in a group after page 236.
They depict temple sculptures of yogis; early book illustrations, both western and from India; portraits of yoga gurus; and photographs of various practices, historic figures, and celebrities.
The final photograph depicts the Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, sitting cross-legged in the street in New Delhi, leading thousands of people in a yoga practice on the first International Yoga Day in 2015.
Publication history.
The book was published in hardback in 2020 by Hurst Publishers of London.
Reception.
"The Story of Yoga" has been warmly received by reviewers in the western world.
The "Financial Times" writes that the book explains how modern western forms of yoga "have overlooked its complex history".
Shearer tells how yoga has both physical and mental effects, including injuries especially in those forms characterised by relentless drive.
At its best, it can bring self-knowledge and calm, but the book denies that yoga offers any magical short cut to such a state.
Mihir Bose, writing in the "Irish Times", adds that in India, yoga has in his lifetime gone from being a fringe activity to a widespread form of exercise.
Writing in "The Daily Telegraph", Mich Brown called the book an "erudite, scholarly and engrossing study".
It notes that Shearer explains that yoga is not a religion, but may slowly align the yogi with the principles underlying all religions, and that the Katha Upanishad calls yoga "this complete stillness in which one enters the unitive state", something that the review says may be a surprise to practitioners of modern Ashtanga yoga and other hot styles.
It quotes Patanjali as saying that "The physical postures should be steady and comfortable" when all effort is relaxed, commenting "but nobody said it would be easy".
Nicolar Barker, in "The Spectator", recalled the recent history of academic research into modern postural yoga, with Norman Sjoman's 1996 "The Yoga Tradition of the Mysore Palace" and Mark Singleton's "controversial" 2010 "Yoga Body: The Origins of Modern Postural Practice", noting that while the research was greeted by Yoga International as "a watershed moment", this was probably spoken "through somewhat gritted teeth".
The review calls Shearer's book "clear-eyed, elegantly written and wonderfully informative", writing that his basic thesis is that "mind yoga" and "body yoga" are sharply distinct, and that he critiques western culture's narcissism, addiction to material wealth, and decreasing attention span.
Writing in "The Sunday Times", Rosamund Unwin noted that three million people practice yoga in Britain, and that a multi-billion dollar industry has grown from ancient roots in India.
In her view, Shearer has made clear that modern yoga is "a long way from yoga's beginnings."
However, she found the book full of jargon, lacking in humanity, and only suitable for those who already practise yoga and want to know more about its cultural context.
Tunku Varadarajan wrote in "The Wall Street Journal" that his wife "follows a routine advertised as yoga, performed by a woman with malleable limbs", that to his Indian eyes "look[s] nothing like the practice whose name they invoke".
The journal called the book "a quick-witted and erudite chronicle of the Hindu practice that is now a lucrative staple of 'wellness' in the West."
It described the book as distinguishing "Raja Yoga, or yoga of the mind, and Hatha Yoga, or the yoga of force.
The former, embedded in meditation, with little or no calisthenic component, is what Patanjali had in mind when he defined yoga as 'the settling of the thought-waves in the mind'.
By contrast, most yoga practiced in the West – as well as in India, it should be said – is a version (however outlandish) of Hatha Yoga."
Michael Neale reviewed the book for "Asian Affairs" journal, calling it "a fascinating survey [and] not only for practitioners of the world's burgeoning Wellness industry".
"The Oldie" wrote that the book's "exhaustive examination of the history and purpose of yoga" had been widely reviewed, something it found unsurprising as yoga had been treated as the answer to all the spiritual and physical ailments of the western world.
It commented that yoga traditionally took "a lifetime to master" and "was never intended to be squeezed into a stress-relieving lunch-hour break".
"The Hindu" found the book readable, answering the question of how the ancient path to enlightenment turned into "a $25 billion-a-year wellness industry".
In its view the opening history chapters had "a scholarly density", though after that it was a lighter read, Shearer arguing that the practice had always been an inward-looking "mind-yoga", and that the west has turned it into a fitness- or health-oriented "body-yoga".
The paper reports that Shearer told it that he took three years to write the book, cutting some 40,000 words of detailed history (such as of the Bihar School of Yoga) from the draft.
The "Hindustan Times" stated that Shearer had an "agenda" to argue "that body-yoga as it is practised in the west does not have any basis in Indian yoga, which was more spiritual and mystical."
The reviewer however found the book "rich in anecdotal data" and found his sensitive account of the teacher-pupil relationship and the current scandals about abuse "nuanced".
Interview.
The Baptist theologian Albert Mohler interviewed Shearer about the book.
Asked why he had written it, Shearer replied that he had learnt Transcendental Meditation at university, and was interested in India, having had relatives there.
He then learnt Sanskrit to study the texts.
He agreed the book was controversial.
Asked whether suburban yoga is "the same thing" practised by yogis in ancient India, he said it was a good question, and the one the book tried to answer, but it depended on why people were practising yoga.
Using it as exercise was fine, but it was not "the full meal"; treating body yoga as the whole system was "selling yoga short".
Shearer agreed with Mohler that yoga had always been understood to be "a unity", and found the Christian perspective interesting and deep; the book's final chapter addressed the question of religion, and whether it could fit with yoga.
He thought there were "many affinities" between Christian traditions such as of the Desert Fathers and yoga, and noted that Catholic priests were expected to be celibate.
He supposed that many Christians who found Hinduism unacceptable would find yoga a practical way "to access their own inner depths".
He agreed with Mohler that the transition from ancient Indian practice to the consumerist, individualist, and celebrity-filled western varieties was full of contradictions, and that it was "certainly misappropriation".
Sahaj Marg 
Sahaj Marg or Heartfulness Meditation is a set of meditative practices first developed at the turn of the twentieth century and formalized into teaching through Shri Ram Chandra Mission in 1945.
It is a form of Raja Yoga meditation system.
Use of "pranahuti" or yogic transmission and the cleaning of impressions (called samskaras) are claimed to be unique to this method.
The Heartfulness Movement's headquarters is located in Kanha Shanti Vanam near Hyderabad in Telangana, India.
The current global guide of the organization is Kamlesh Patel (Daaji).
History.
The organizational body Shri Ram Chandra Mission was formally registered in 1945 by Ram Chandra (1899-1983).
As part of the Sahaj Marg spiritual practice, Ram Chandra adopted a technique called pranahuti as taught by his spiritual master bearing the same name Ram Chandra of Fatehgarh in India (popularly called "Lalaji" by his followers).
Practice.
The system involves daily and weekly practices including solitary and group meditation.
Heartfulness practices include relaxation, meditation, cleaning (or rejuvenation) and prayer.
Meditation focuses on the practitioner's heart.
A subtle yogic transmission, also called "pranahuti", is a part of the system, and so is "cleaning" or "rejuvenation", which involves suggestions and positive affirmations.
The practitioner performs a prayer before going to bed at night.
Vijñāna Bhairava Tantra 
The Vijñāna-bhairava-tantra (VBT, sometimes spelled in a Hindicised way as "Vigyan Bhairav Tantra") is a Shaiva Tantra, of the Kaula Trika tradition of Kashmir Shaivism.
Singh notes that it is difficult to establish an exact date for the text, and it could have been written at some time from the 7th to the 8th century CE.
It is also called the Śiva-jñāna-upaniṣad by Abhinavagupta.
The VBT is framed as a discourse between Bhairava (the "tremendous one", or "the terrifying") and the goddess Bhairavi in 163 Sanskrit anuṣṭubh stanzas.
It briefly presents around 112 Tantric meditation methods ("yuktis") or centering techniques ("dhāraṇās") in very compressed form.
These practices are supposed to lead to the recognition of the true nature of Reality, the "tremendous" or "awesome" consciousness (i.e. "vijñāna-bhairava").
These include several variants of breath awareness, concentration on various centers in the body, non-dual awareness, mantra practice, visualizations and contemplations which make use of the senses.
A prerequisite to success in any of the practices is a clear understanding of which method is most suitable to the practitioner.
Overview.
The text presents itself as containing the essence of the "Rudrayamala-tantra", a Bhairava tantra that is now lost.
In the "Vijñāna-bhairava-tantra" (VBT), Bhairavi, the goddess (Shakti), asks Bhairava (the terrifying form of Shiva) to reveal the essence of how to realize the true nature of reality.
In his answer Bhairava describes 112 ways to enter into the universal and transcendental state of consciousness.
References to it appear throughout the literature of Kashmir Shaivism, indicating that it was considered to be an important text in this tradition.
The VBT describes the goal of these practices, the "true nature of reality", as follows in the Christopher Wallis translation from 2018: 
According to Christopher Wallis, Bhairava and Bhairavi are also used to refer to expanded states of consciousness, with Bhairavi referring more to energetic and active ("śakti") states, and Bhairava referring to still and quiescent ("śūnya") states.
Wallis also notes that the text exhibits a "strong Buddhist influence", and one of the most common meditations taught in the text focuses on the ‘voidness’ ("śūnya") of things, such as verse 48 which offers a meditation on the body as empty space, and verses 45 and 49 which teach meditations on the empty space of the heart.
Practices.
Most of the VBT's verses are brief compressed descriptions of various practices that allow one to access the state of Bhairava consciousness.
Mark Dyczkowski has classified the practices of the VBT into various main types along with the verses in which they appear: 
Commentaries and English translations.
The text appeared in 1918 in the Kashmir Series of Text and Studies ("KSTS").
The Kashmir Series published two volumes, one with a commentary in Sanskrit by Kshemaraja and Shivopadhyaya and the other with a commentary, called "Kaumadi", by Ananda Bhatta.
In 1957, Paul Reps brought the text to wide attention by including a poetic English translation in his popular book "Zen Flesh, Zen Bones".
Reps' translation was the subject of a voluminous commentary by Osho.
As the Sanskritist Christopher Wallis writes, many of English VBT translations have been done by persons who lack training in reading Sanskrit and who lack the background of reading the sanskrit tantric texts that the VBT relies on.
The result has been various poetic or free form renderings which fail to properly communicate the actual practices which are briefly outlined in the text.
Two exceptions to this are Jaideva Singh's translation and Mark Dyczkowski's translation.
The various VBT translations include the following: 
Sundo 
Sundo - also known as Kouk Sun Do (국선도) - is a Korean Taoist art based on meditation, and which aims at the personal development of its practitioners, both at the physical, mental and spiritual levels.
Through the practice of meditation, abdominal breathing and holding positions, the practitioner cultivates his “Ki” (vital energy, also called Qi in Chinese), and develops flexibility, physical ease, health and serenity.
Rather similar to Indian Yoga or Chinese Qigong arts like Tai chi, Sundo has its origins in the mountains of present-day Korea, millennia ago; The particularity of this art is the extreme richness of the exercises according to the level of the practitioner, which allows a smooth progression adapted to the rhythm of life of modern humans.
Sundo (Hangul: 선도; Hanja: 仙道) should not be confused with Sunmudo (Hangul: 선무도; Hanja: 禅 武 道).
Although their pronunciations appear similar, the former is a Taoist health practice based on static postures and meditation, while the latter is a Buddhist martial art based on dynamic movements.
History and development.
The Sundo has very ancient roots, which go back to ancient Korea, in Northeast Asia.
Practiced for centuries under the name of "Taoism of the Mountain" (San Saram), it recently took the name of Kouk Sun Do (or Kukson-do, the characters Hangeul and Hanja being the same for both spellings) in homage to its institutionalization in the Kingdom of Paekche by the order of Samrang (also called "Kukson") in 320 A.D - after the unification of the Three Kingdoms (Koguryo, Silla and Paekche) by the order of Hwarang, some practitioners of Kouk Sun Do retired to the mountains in order to freely practice their art and thus ensure its sustainability.
Since then, the practice of Kouk Sun Do has been passed down secretly among Taoist mountain monks, from teacher to student, for generations.
It was not until 1967 that the monk Chung-Woon sent his disciple Be-Kyung to teach Kouk Sun Do to the rest of the world.
Be-kyung.
Be-Kyung's original name was Chung-San (Eng. "the Blue Mountain").
In the late 1940s, as a child, Chung-San encountered a Taoist monk on the mountain named Chung-Woon (Eng. "Clear Clouds").
Legend has it that Chung-Woon offered to teach Chung-San how to break stones with his bare hands if he agreed to follow him, who would have agreed.
Thus began the training of Chung-San in Kouk Sun Do with Chung-Woon and his master Moo-Woon (Without Cloud).
In 1967, after twenty years of Asceticism and training, Chung-Woon asked Chung-San to leave the mountain to go and spread the ancient wisdom of Kouk Sun Do to the world.
On this occasion, Chung-San was renamed Be-Kyung (the Secret Frontier) by his master.
Following some demonstrations of the benefits of his art, Be-Kyung opened the first Kouk Sun Do school in 1970 in Seoul.
Initially, Be-Kyung taught all of the practices he had inherited from the Kukson monks: martial arts (Su Sul) and internal arts (Kouk Sun Do); then he concentrated on the internal practice, the most important to him.
During this period, he wrote two books available only in Korea: one chronicling his life as a hermit with Chung-Woon, the other containing more information about the Kouk Sun Do itself.
In 1983, after making sure that his former students would disseminate his art in turn, Be-Kyung returned peacefully to his life as a Taoist monk in the mountains.
Among the twelve masters trained by Be-Kyung, Hyun-moon Kim is the one who spread the Sundo the most beyond the borders of Korea.
Hyun-moon Kim.
In 1979, after several years of training under the direction of Be-Kyung, Hyun-moon Kim introduced the Sundo to the West, particularly the United States, Canada and Europe.
Doctor of Philosophy, Master Hyun-moon Kim combines ancestral Korean wisdom and modern Western psychology to teach Sundo Taoist principles, with a view to personal development aimed at improving the quality of life of his students.
He is the author of a book on Taoism and related practices, titled "The Tao of Life".
He has opened a Sundo school in West Hartford, Connecticut, and holds numerous Instructor training retreats in Barnet, Vermont.
Master Kim divides his time between his Sundo dojang in the United States and the courses he gives at the Hanseo University in South Korea.
He is also president of the International Institute for Sundo-Taoist Cultural Research (IISCR) in Tangjin, South Korea.
International spread.
Sundo is one of the largest health and wellness entities in South Korea, with significant bases in France and Eastern European countries, like Czech, Romania and Russia.
Nowadays, Sundo has spread throughout South Korea, this tradition has become a national treasure of the country.
It is practiced by a wide variety of people, regardless of their religious and political beliefs and type of activity: heads of large enterprises and students, monks and politicians, blue-collar workers and celebrities.
The organizations promoting Sundo are Kuksundo World Federation, World Kuksundo Federation, and Deokdang Kukseondo.
In South Korea.
The World Kukseondo Federation currently has about 300 dojangs across South Korea, which trains body and mind based on Korean Danjeon breathing, meditation, and martial arts.
The organization is seeking international expansion.
France.
The main mover of Sundo in France is Philippe Lewkowicz - who is currently the representative for France of the International Sundo Federation.
He has been practicing martial arts since 1980 and it was in 1987 that he was introduced to Sundo with Master Hyunmoon Kim.
Having lived twenty years in the United States, Master Philippe Lewkowicz spent several years learning and mastering Sundo techniques from Master Hyunmoon Kim, and he finally obtained the Sundo Master degree in 1996 in Korea.
Back in France for professional reasons, Philippe Lewkowicz continued to work on the development of Sundo.
Nicolas Tacchi is also another major mover of the art.
Tacchi is an expert in Korean martial arts: he is the president of the Francophone Federation of Sin Moo Hapkido, Sundo and associated disciplines.
He began practicing Sundo with Master Philippe Lewkowicz in the early 2000s, then with Master Hyunmoon Kim, with whom he took part in several courses in France as well as a retreat in Vermont, in order to become an instructor of Sundo.
Tacchi is also a professional musician at the Opéra National de Lorraine since 1985 and has spread the Sundo among professional musicians and students in the prevention of pathologies due to the performing arts in general and to the practice of a musical instrument in particular.
As part of this project, he worked between 2008 and 2012 at INSET Nancy.
Many conservatories around the world have already included internal practices similar to Sundo in their curriculum to improve the breathing and posture of musicians.
More generally, Sundo is a highly beneficial internal practice in a context of regular stress related to professional activity, and can therefore be recommended as part of campaigns to fight against anxiety within a company, or quite simply for the well-being of employees.
He currently teaches in Nancy, at MJC Lillebonne.
Practice of Sundo.
Sundo is a technique aimed at stimulating internal energy (called "Ki" by the Japanese and Koreans, "Qi" or "Chi" by the Chinese), through breathing exercises, postures and to meditation.
The energy thus gathered is then used to establish and maintain the various balances: physical, emotional and spiritual.
Sundo's theoretical approach is the same as in acupuncture: by acting on the meridians of the body, you achieve a state of relaxation, inner calm, and you also strengthen your immune system, thus balancing the body and mind.
The basic Sundo exercises, although very gentle, also greatly improve flexibility and physical ease, which allows the practitioner to feel their best in their body.
Finally, at the end of assiduous learning, the practitioner tackles the deep meditation exercises, which complete their inner development.
The purpose is to actually develop the strength of the mind and improve the personality that can control oneself through the practice of Sundo.
It is not actually the purpose of performing danjeon breathing to exert instantaneous powers such as accumulating and destroying energy through breathing.
Typical session.
A Sundo session begins with a "long warm-up" (about half an hour), consisting of stretching and self-massage, designed to relax the body and prepare it for the exercises that follow.
Then comes the part "Meditation" (the heart of the work), lasting 40 minutes, during which the practitioner stimulates his energy and his body by exercises of holding positions (25 positions for beginners, only one for masters), coupled with deep abdominal breathing called "Danjeon breathing", the difficulty of which varies according to the level of practice.
Finally, the session ends with a series of stretching and twisting exercises intended to circulate energy through the meridians to each internal organ, and to free the body and muscles from all the blockages related to sedentary life.
This third and final part also includes some rhythmic muscle strengthening exercises.
While Sundo practice is optimal when done daily, performing two or three sessions per week is already enough to experience major improvements in physical and mental well-being.
Practitioners are also invited to take part in retreats organized by the Instructors several times a year.
The pedagogical progression of Sundo is done through "forms" (akin to taolu), which correspond to the sequence of postures to be performed in the second part of the session.
Regularly, a change of Tableau leads to a change of belt, up to the black belt, like many Korean and Japanese martial arts.
Progression.
Sundo can be practiced at all ages, at all levels, whatever the initial physical condition.
As they progress through the forms, the students approach, step by step, and without ever forcing, exercises of increasing difficulty.
The progression varies according to the frequency and the quality of the practice.
Once a red belt, the practitioner can be awarded the title of Instructor, then Senior Instructor, and finally Teacher (Sa Bom Nim).
There are five levels of practice in the Sundo: 
The first three tables correspond to the beginner, intermediate and advanced levels, up to the yellow belt.
Then come another 31 forms.
Advantages.
From the general point of view, Sundo practice and yoga practice have similarities.
The fundamental is a method of regaining health through balance and harmony of the body through the way of moving the body while properly breathing, which is the source of human life.
Moments of Mindfulness 
Moments of Mindfulness (originally published on October 5, 2005, by Parallax Press) is a non-fiction, self-help book by Thích Nhất Hạnh.
It is like a journal for Meditation.
Overview.
Moments of Mindfulness is intended to be a personal notebook.
This book has teachings of Thích Nhất Hạnh, the Buddhist monk and basic meditation instructions.
It has two-colour illustrations by Jenifer Kent.
The set contains 40 cards to provide inspiration and work as starting points for meditation and reveal spiritual answers for daily problems.
It also has blank pages for personal reflections.
Altered Traits 
Altered Traits: Science Reveals How Meditation Changes Your Mind, Brain, and Body, published in Great Britain as 'The Science of Meditation: How to Change Your Brain, Mind and Body', is a 2017 book by science journalist Daniel Goleman and neuroscientist Richard Davidson.
The book discusses research on meditation.
For the book, the authors conducted a literature review of over 6,000 scientific studies on meditation, and selected the 60 that they believed met the highest methodological standards.
Summary.
The authors write that meditation can be practised at two levels: the "deep path" of intensive meditative discipline aiming for total self-transformation, and the "wide path" of less intensive practice that can reach a larger number of people.
The book discusses both these levels, with findings on the highest-level meditators toward the end of the book.
After attending meditation retreats in Asia and while graduate students together at Harvard in the 1970s, Goleman and Davidson formulated the hypothesis that "the after is the before for the next during"—meaning the changes that endure after the end of a meditation session contribute to a more equanimous starting point for the next meditation session.
Such lasting psychological changes, or "altered traits", are the focus of the book, as opposed to "altered states of consciousness" during meditation that end along with the meditation session.
The authors explain a range of methodological obstacles to studying meditation scientifically, which have resulted in many flawed studies; they write that based on an exhaustive literature review by Davidson's research group, they selected only studies they deemed to meet the highest standards to use in the book.
The authors write that meditation leads to reduced stress reactivity, for instance that 30 hours of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) practice leads to reduced amygdala activation and that long-term meditation practice increases connectivity between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the amygdala.
Regarding compassion, they distinguish between cognitive empathy, emotional empathy, and empathic concern, the last of which results in action to help reduce suffering, and state that as little as eight hours of loving-kindness meditation can increase empathic concern.
They write that meditation is at its core about retraining attention, and discuss studies showing that a small amount of meditation can improve attention in the short-term (as reflected, for instance, in a shorter attentional blink) while long-term practice brings lasting improvement.
Next, the authors turn to the sense of self, reflected in the self-referential and often unpleasant mind-wandering of the brain's default mode network, writing that in early meditation practice brain circuits inhibit its activity and that in later practice activity in the network itself decreases.
While they state that meditation was not originally developed to treat illness, it does appear to have some beneficial effects in this regard, including reducing levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines—though they say these are not yet well understood.
Meditation was likewise not designed to treat psychopathology, but they note (among other findings) that a meta-analysis of 47 studies found meditation and medicine equally effective in treating depression, anxiety, and pain, without medication's negative side effects.
The next chapter recounts how Davidson's lab, with the help of French Buddhist monk Matthieu Ricard, recruited yogis including Mingyur Rinpoche in order to study the neurological effects of high-level meditation, and—in a much-cited study—found substantial surges in both electrical activity (using EEG) and activity in the brain's circuits for empathy (using fMRI) when Mingyur meditated on compassion.
The authors write that experienced yogis have much higher levels of gamma waves, that they show little anticipation of pain and a very fast recovery from it, and that they can re-focus and hold their attention with little effort.
The authors then summarize the benefits of meditation they have so far described for three levels of practice: beginner, long-term, and "Olympic-level."
In the last chapter, the authors discuss possible new applications of meditation research, and remind their readers of the paucity of reliable data on meditation when they first became interested in the 1970s compared to the large and growing evidence base available now.
Reception.
A book review for Psych Central praises the book for avoiding the common sensationalism on the topic while exploring important research.
It states: "In their new book, [...] recognized experts in their fields and lifelong meditators Daniel Goleman and Richard J. Davidson reveal the data that demonstrate just what meditation can and can’t do."
UC Berkeley's "Greater Good Magazine" gave a strongly positive review of the book.
It describes "Altered Traits" as "a highly readable book that helps readers separate the wheat from the chaff of mindfulness science" and which makes "a cogent argument that meditation, in various forms, has the power to transform us not only in the moment, but in more profound, lasting ways."
The review also states that "Davidson and Goleman dutifully report the counter evidence as well."
The book received a more critical review in the journal "NeuroRegulation".
The review gives a list of noteworthy research findings and methodological contributions for future research, and acknowledges the obstacles faced by scientists working in fields that are not fully accepted.
However, in a concluding note it cautions: "From an academic point of view, even this book and the research shared adds up to a set of questionable empirical evidence that at times clearly lacks impartiality."
A review in "New Scientist" compares the book with Thomas Joiner's book "Mindlessness", which argues that mindfulness meditation has been oversold.
The review calls "Altered Traits" "much needed" while dismissing Joiner's criticism of mindfulness as misplaced.
An article on "Mindful.org" comments that "when you weed out the studies that don’t meet the highest scientific standards, as Goleman and Davidson have done in their book, a clear picture emerges of what we know about the science of meditation—and what we still need to learn."
Naam Japo 
In Sikhism, Nām Japō  
(, pronunciation: ), also known as Naam Japna or Naam Simran, refers to the meditation or contemplation of the various Names of God (or qualities of God), especially the chanting of the word "Waheguru" ('Wonderful Teacher') representing the formless being, the creator of all the forms, and the being omnipresent in all forms.
Less commonly, it is the vocal singing of hymns from the Guru Granth Sahib; the singing of hymns is generally also referred to as "Nām Riramon Bunman".
Singing of hymns with musical accompaniment is generally referred to as "kirtan".
While contemplating God's names a devotee is able to get "nām", the divine connection with God.
Nām Riramon Bunman is able to fulfill all desires and cleanse the mind of its impurities distress.
Through "nām", the devotees are able to harness Godly qualities and remove the five thieves.
Overview.
"Nām Japna" requires the remembrance of God or the Akal Purkh, the supreme formless power that is timeless and deathless, by repeating and focusing the mind on a single repetition of one of God's various names or qualities.
A particular name or phase is administered to someone when they are initiated into the Sikh faith more often than not this is the Mul Mantar, which is repeated throughout the Guru Granth Sahib.
Many other names are also found in Guru Gobind Singh's Jaap Sahib, which contains 950 names of God.
The guideline in the "Rehat Maryada" of Guru Gobind Singh demands that the Sikh engage in "Naam Simran" as part of his or her daily routine.
"Nām Japō" is one of the three pillars of Sikhism, along with "Kirat karō" and "Vaṇḍ chakkō".
Critical importance is given to the meditation in the Guru Granth Sahib as the way in which humans can conquer ego, greed, attachment, anger and lust, together commonly called the Five Evils or Five Thieves and to bring peace and tranquility into one's mind.
The Sikhs practice both the quiet individual recitation of "Naam" in one's mind, commonly called "Naam Simran", and the loud and communal recitation of "Naam", called "Naam Jaap".
However, this is not a strict definition of these phrases.
In the Guru Granth Sahib: 
Simran 
Simran (Gurmukhi: ਸਿਮਰਨ, pronunciation: ; ; from Sanskrit: , "smaraṇa", 'to remember, reminisce, recollect'), in spirituality, is a Sanskrit word referring to the continuous remembrance of the finest aspect of the self, and/or the continuous remembrance (or feeling) of God.
This state is maintained continuously while carrying out the worldly works outside.
Sikhism.
"Simran"—commonly used as a verb in Gurmukhi—refers to 'meditating' on the name ("nām") of God.
Sikhism is a distinct faith, whereby God can be realized purely through individual devotion, without subjection to rites and rituals by priests or other intermediaries.
According to the Guru Granth Sahib, through simran, one is purified and attains salvation ("mukti").
This is because "si-mar" means 'to die over', thus indicating the death of ego, allowing the realization of ultimate truth ("sach") to appear.
On page 202 of the Guru Granth Sahib: 
This hymn teaches that a person who wishes to gain from this human life must attain a higher spiritual state by becoming free of attachment by realizing emptiness of worldly phenomena.
Thereby, merit is acquired by devoutly repeating, comprehending, and living by the sacred word every day so as to progressively reveal the divine and ultimate truth to the person who earnestly seeks it: 
Guru Ram Das says in "Sarang ki var" (Guru Granth Sahib, 1242): 
Sant Mat.
In Sant Mat, the word simran is used for the spiritual practice of repeating the mantra given by the Satguru during initiation.
The mantra itself is also called Simran.
Simran repetition is done during meditation and also outside it, however this mantra is later dropped in favor of real feeling of self or the God, which happens due to breaking out of monotony through Jap.
Thus mantra is used only until the point, monotony and previously formed patterns are broken.
After it pure Simran is carried by the sadhak.
Self-compassion 
Self-compassion is extending compassion to one's self in instances of perceived inadequacy, failure, or general suffering.
Kristin Neff has defined self-compassion as being composed of three main elements – self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness.
Self-compassion in some ways resembles Carl Rogers' notion of "unconditional positive regard" applied both towards clients and oneself; Albert Ellis' "unconditional self-acceptance"; Maryhelen Snyder's notion of an "internal empathizer" that explored one's own experience with "curiosity and compassion"; Ann Weiser Cornell's notion of a gentle, allowing relationship with all parts of one's being; and Judith Jordan's concept of "self-empathy", which implies acceptance, care and empathy towards the self.
Self-compassion is different from self-pity, a state of mind or emotional response of a person believing to be a victim and lacking the confidence and competence to cope with an adverse situation.
Research indicates that self-compassionate individuals experience greater psychological health than those who lack self-compassion.
For example, self-compassion is positively associated with life satisfaction, wisdom, happiness, optimism, curiosity, learning goals, social connectedness, personal responsibility, and emotional resilience.
At the same time, it is associated with a lower tendency for self-criticism, depression, anxiety, rumination, thought suppression, perfectionism, and disordered eating attitudes.
Self-compassion has different effects than self-esteem, a subjective emotional evaluation of the self.
Although psychologists extolled the benefits of self-esteem for many years, recent research has exposed costs associated with the pursuit of high self-esteem, including narcissism, distorted self-perceptions, contingent and/or unstable self-worth, as well as anger and violence toward those who threaten the ego.
As self-esteem is often associated with perceived self-worth in externalised domains such as appearance, academics and social approval, it is often unstable and susceptible to negative outcomes.
In comparison, it appears that self-compassion offers the same mental health benefits as self-esteem, but with fewer of its drawbacks such as narcissism, ego-defensive anger, inaccurate self-perceptions, self-worth contingency, or social comparison.
Scales.
Much of the research conducted on self-compassion so far has used the Self-Compassion Scale, created by Kristin Neff, which measures the degree to which individuals display self-kindness against self-judgment, common humanity versus isolation, and mindfulness versus over-identification.
The Self-Compassion Scale has been translated into different languages.
Some of these include a Czech, Dutch, Japanese, Chinese, Turkish and Greek version.
Development.
The original sample for which the scale was developed consisted of 68 undergraduate students from a large university in the United States.
In this experiment, the participants narrowed down the potential scale items to 71.
The next stage of development involved testing the reliability and validity of the scale among a larger group of participants.
During this research study, 391 undergraduate students were selected at random to complete the 71 previously narrowed down scale items.
Based on their results, the number of items was reduced to 26.
The Self-Compassion Scale has good reliability and validity.
A second study was conducted to look more closely at the difference between self-esteem and self-compassion.
This study consisted of 232 randomly selected, undergraduate students.
Participants were asked to complete a number of different scales in questionnaire form.
They were as follows: The 26-item Self-Compassion Scale, the 10-item Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, the 10-item Self-determination Scale, the 21-item Basic Psychological Needs Scale, and the 40-item Narcissistic Personality Inventory.
Based on the findings, Neff reports "that self-compassion and self-esteem were measuring two different psychological phenomena."
A third study was conducted to examine the construct validity.
By comparing two different groups of people, researchers would be able to see the different levels of self-compassion.
Forty-three Buddhist practitioners completed the Self-Compassion Scale as well as a self-esteem scale.
The sample of 232 undergraduate students from the second study was used as the comparison group.
As expected by Neff, the Buddhist practitioners had significantly higher self-compassion scores than the students.
Self-compassion scale.
The long version of the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) consists of 26 items.
This includes 6 subscales – self-kindness, self-judgement, common humanity, isolation, mindfulness, and over-identification.
Neff recommends this scale for ages 14 and up with a minimum 8th grade reading level.
Presented on a Likert scale, ranging from 1 (almost no self-compassion) to 5 (constant self-compassion), those completing the SCS are able to gain insight on how they respond to themselves during a struggle or challenging time.
Short form.
The short version of the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS-SF) consists of 12 items and is available in Dutch and English.
Research reveals that the short form scale can be used competently as a substitute for the long form scale.
A study conducted at the University of Leuven, Belgium concluded that when examining total scores, this shorter version provides an almost perfect correlation with the longer version.
Six-factor model.
Neff's scale proposes six interacting components of self-compassion, which can be grouped as three dimensions with two opposite facets.
The first dimension is self-kindness versus self-judgment, and taps into how individuals emotionally relate to themselves.
Self-kindness refers to one's ability to be kind and understanding of oneself, whereas self-judgement refers to being critical and harsh towards oneself.
The second dimension is common humanity versus isolation, and taps into how people cognitively understand their relationship to others.
Common humanity refers to one's ability to recognize that everyone is imperfect and that suffering is part of the human condition, whereas isolation refers to feeling all alone in one's suffering.
The third dimension is mindfulness versus over-identification, and taps into how people pay attention to their pain.
Mindfulness refers to one's awareness and acceptance of painful experiences in a balanced and non-judgmental way, whereas over-identification refers to being absorbed by and ruminating on one's pain.
Neff argues the six components of self-compassion interact and operate as a system.
Support for this view was demonstrated in a study which found that writing with either kindness, common humanity or mindfulness yielded increases on the other self-compassion dimensions.
Criticisms of Neff's scale.
Currently, Kristin Neff's Self-Compassion Scale is the main self-report instrument used to measure self-compassion.
Although it is widely accepted as being a reliable and valid tool to measure self-compassion, some researchers have posed questions regarding the scale's generalizability and its use of a six-factor model.
Generalizability.
Although some have questioned the generalizability of Neff's Self-Compassion Scale, a recent study found support for the measurement invariance of the scale across 18 samples, including student, community, and clinical samples in 12 different translations 
Six-factor model.
A 2015 study performed by Angélica López et al. examined the factor structure, reliability, and construct validity of the 24 item Dutch version of Neff's Self-Compassion Scale using a large representative sample from the general population.
The study consisted of 1,736 participants and used both a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to determine if Neff's six-factor structure could be replicated.
Lopez's study could not replicate the six-factor structure of Neff's Self-Compassion Scale, but rather suggested a two-factor model of the scale, created by grouping the positive and negative items separately.
Lopez argued that self-compassion and self-criticism are distinct.
More recently, however, a large 20 sample study (N=11,685) examined the factor structure of the SCS in 13 translations, using bifactor Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling, which is a more appropriate way to analyze constructs that operate as a system.
In this comprehensive study one general factor and six specific factors had the best fit in every sample examined, while a two-factor solution had an inadequate fit.
Moreover, over 95% of the reliable variance in item responding could be explained by a single general factor.
This factor structure has been found to be invariant across cultures 
Other evidence for the view that self-compassion is a global construct composed of six components that operate as a system stems from the fact that all six components change in tandem and are configured as a balanced system within individuals 
Exercises.
Self-compassion exercises generally consist of either a writing exercise, role-playing, or introspective contemplation, and are designed to foster self-kindness, mindfulness, and feelings of common humanity.
Self-compassion exercises have been shown to be effective in increasing self-compassion, along with increases in self-efficacy, optimism, and mindfulness.
These exercises have also been shown to decrease rumination.
In individuals who were vulnerable to depression, one week of daily self-compassion exercises lead to reduced depression up to three months following the exercise, and increased happiness up to six months following the exercise, regardless of the pre-exercise levels of happiness.
How would you treat a friend?
This exercise asks the user to imagine that they are comforting a close friend who is going through a tough situation.
The user is then asked to compare and contrast how they react internally to their own struggles, and to endeavour applying the same loving kindness to themselves that they would apply to a friend.
Self-compassion break.
This exercise is to be used during times of acute distress.
The user is asked to focus on a stressful event or situation.
Then, the user is asked to repeat several prompts to themselves, each of which emphasizes one of the three main tenets of self-compassion: mindfulness, common humanity, and self-kindness.
Exploring through writing.
In this exercise, the user is asked to focus on a facet of themself that they believe to be an imperfection, and that makes them feel inadequate.
Once they have brought this issue to mind, they are asked to write a letter to themself from the perspective of an unconditionally loving imaginary friend.
The user is then asked to focus on the soothing and comforting feelings of compassion that they have generated for themself.
Criticizer, criticized, and compassionate observer.
This exercise asks the user to occupy several "chairs" during the course of the practice.
Initially, they are asked to occupy the chair of the self-critic, and to express their feelings of self-criticism.
They are asked to analyze this criticism and make note of its defining characteristics.
Then, the user is asked to take the chair of their criticized self, and to imagine verbally responding to their inner critic.
Subsequently, the user is prompted to conduct a dialogue between these two aspects of the self, the criticizer and the criticized.
Following this, the user is asked to imagine themself as a compassionate observer of this dialogue, and finally the user is asked to reflect upon the experience.
Changing your critical self-talk.
This exercise is meant to be conducted over several weeks, in the form of recurring reflection on the nature of their self-criticism.
Users are asked to aim to notice when they are being self-critical, to react to their self-criticism with compassion, and to reframe the language of their inner critic.
Journal.
This exercise entails keeping a daily journal for at least one week, and is used to reflect on difficult experiences, self-criticisms, and other stressors.
The user is asked to analyze each of these events through the lenses of self-kindness (using gentle, comforting language to respond to the event), mindfulness (awareness of the negative emotions elicited by the situation), and common humanity (how the experience is part of the human condition).
Identifying what we really want.
In this exercise, the user is asked to think about the ways that they use self-criticism as a way to motivate themself.
Then, the user is asked to try to come up with a kinder and gentler and more caring way of motivating themself to make the desired change, and to try and be aware of how they use self-criticism as a motivational tool in the future.
Taking care of the caregiver.
This exercise prompts the user to engage in meaningful self-care on a regular basis, and to practice these techniques while they are actively caring for others.
Self-forgiveness as an element.
Self-forgiveness is an element of self-compassion that involves releasing self-directed negative feelings.
Research has found that self-forgiveness promotes greater overall well-being, specifically higher self-esteem and lower neuroticism.
Pro-social behavior.
When self-directed negative feelings are a result of negative past action, self-forgiveness does not mean ignoring or excusing offenses, but rather practicing self-compassion while taking full responsibility for past action.
In this way, self-forgiveness may increase people's willingness to repent for wrongdoing.
Despite this research, there is not yet a clear link between self-forgiveness and pro-social behavior.
It would seem that accepting responsibility for negative actions leads to pro-social behavior, and coupling acceptance with self-forgiveness increases this effect.
Self-acceptance as an element.
Self-acceptance is an element of self-compassion that involves accepting oneself for who and what they are.
Self-acceptance differs from self-esteem in that self-esteem involves globally evaluating one's worth.
Self-acceptance means accepting the self despite flaws, weaknesses, and negative evaluations from others.
Mindfulness.
History.
The concept of mindfulness and self-compassion has been around for over 2500 years, and is rooted in Eastern traditional Buddhist philosophy and Buddhist meditation.
In Buddhist philosophy, mindfulness and compassion is considered to be two wings of one bird, with each concept overlapping one another but producing benefits for wellbeing.
The word Mindfulness is the English translation of the word Vipassanā, which a combination of two words Vi, meaning in a special way and Passana, to observe, hence implying to observe in a special way.
Compassion (karunaa) can be defined as an emotion that elicits the wanting to be free from suffering.
Mindfulness in the context of self-compassion comprises acknowledging one's painful experiences in a balanced way that neither ignores, or ruminates on the disliked characteristics of oneself or life.
According to Neff (2012) it is essential to be mindful of one's own personal suffering in order to extend compassion towards one's self.
However it is essential to pay attention to self suffering in a grounded way in order to avoid "over-identification".
Mindfulness tends to focus on the internal experience such as sensation, emotion and thoughts rather than focusing on the experiencer.
Self-compassion focuses on soothing and comforting the self when faced with distressing experiences.
Self-compassion is composed of three components; self kindness versus self-judgement, a sense of common humanity versus isolation and mindfulness versus over-identification when confronting painful thoughts and emotions.
Mindfulness-based stress reduction.
Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn is a structured group program that uses mindfulness meditation to relieve suffering associated with physical, psychosomatic and psychiatric disorders.
Mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy seeks to increase the capacity for mindfulness, by reducing the need for self-focused thoughts and emotions that can lead to poor mental health.
The exercise of mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy brings together the elements of meditation and yoga, greater awareness of the unity of mind and body, as well as the ways that the unconscious thoughts, feelings, and behaviors can undermine emotional, physical, and spiritual health.
Clinical research from the past 25 years has found that MBSR is efficacious in reducing distress and enhancing individual well-being.
Self-Compassion can play a critical role in mindfulness-based cognitive therapy interventions.
In the study Shapiro et al. (2005) found that health care professionals who underwent a MBSR program reported significantly increased self-compassion and reduced stress levels compared to the waitlist control group.
It was also reported that the increase of self-compassion appeared to reduce stress associated with the program.
Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy.
Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an intervention therapy that combines meditation practices, psycho-education and cognitive behavioral strategies to prevent the relapse or recurrence of major depression.
MBCT teaches individuals how to observe their thoughts and feelings by focusing their attention on natural objects, such as breathing and bodily sensations.
Individuals are taught how to achieve awareness while holding an attitude of non-judgemental acceptance.
Within MBCT, mindfulness skills are taught in order to recognize distressing thoughts and feelings, to be aware of these experiences, and utilize acceptance and self-compassion to break up associative networks that may cause a relapse.
Self-compassion in response to negative thoughts and feelings is an adaptive process, which validates it as a key learning skill in MBCT.
Self-compassion has been found to be a key mechanism in the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions such as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT).
Kuyken et al. (2010) compared the effect of MBCT with maintenance antidepressants on relapse in depressive symptoms.
They found that mindfulness and self-compassion were increased after MBCT was introduced.
They also found that MBCT reduced the connection of cognitive reactivity and depressive relapse, and that the increased self-compassion helped mediate this association.
Mindfulness-based pain management.
Mindfulness-based pain management (MBPM) is a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) providing specific applications for people living with chronic pain and illness.
Adapting the core concepts and practices of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), MBPM includes a distinctive emphasis on the practice of 'loving-kindness', and has been seen as sensitive to concerns about removing mindfulness teaching from its original ethical framework within Buddhism.
It was developed by Vidyamala Burch and is delivered through the programs of Breathworks.
It has been subject to a range of clinical studies demonstrating its effectiveness.
Mindful self-compassion therapy.
Mindful self-compassion (MSC) therapy is a hybrid therapy consisting of self-compassion and mindfulness practices.
The term mindful is referred to in the MSC program as the basic mindfulness skills which is turning toward painful thoughts and emotions and seeing them as they are without suppression or avoidance which is crucial to the development of self-compassion.
The MSC program however focuses more on self-compassion and sees mindfulness as a secondary emphasis.
MSC teaches both formal (meditation) and informal (daily life) self-compassion practices.
In addition there are homework MSC assignments that teaches participants to be kinder to themselves.
The goal of MSC therapy is to provide participants with a variety of tools to increase self-compassion which they can then in turn integrate into their lives.
A study conducted by Neff and Germer (2012) found that compared with the control group, MSC intervention participants reported significantly larger increases in self-compassion, mindfulness, wellbeing and a decrease in depression, stress and anxiety which were maintained for 6 months after the initial intervention.
Compassion focused therapy.
Paul Gilbert (2009) developed compassion focused therapy (CFT) that teaches clients that, due to how our brains have evolved, anxiety, anger and depression are natural experiences that are occur through no fault of our own.
Patients are trained to change maladaptive thought patterns such as "I'm unlovable" and provide alternative self-statements, such as "I know for sure that some people love me".
The goal of CFT is to help patients develop a sense of warmth and emotional responsiveness to oneself.
This is achieved through a variety of exercises including visualization, cultivating self-kindest through language by engaging in self-compassionate behaviors and habits.
In CFT self-compassion is utilized through thoughts, images, and attention which is needed to stimulate and develop the contentment, sooth and safeness system.
Mindfulness skills in dialectical behavior therapy.
Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), is a derivative of cognitive behavior therapy that incorporates Eastern meditative practice.
DBT is based on a dialectical world view that incorporates the balance and integration of opposing beliefs, particularly in acceptance and change.
We accept ourselves as good enough, and we recognize the need for all of us to change and grow.
Unlike MBCT and MBSR therapies, dialectical behavior therapy does not use meditation but less formal exercises, such as individual therapy sessions and group skill sessions.
In general last for approximately a year where participants will engage in weekly individual skill therapy sessions and group skill sessions.
The skills therapy sessions include four segments; core mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation, and distress tolerance skills.
Dialectical behaviour therapist recommend developing self-compassion.
The basic premise of using self-compassion therapies in DBT is to cultivate a compassionate mind state, defined by feelings of warmth, safety, presence and interconnectedness that can in turn relieve emotional dysregulation.
Mindfulness and related skills in acceptance and commitment therapy.
Acceptance and commitment therapy utilizes behavior change process, mindfulness and acceptance process.
ACT, involves non-judgmental awareness and openness to cognitive sensation an emotional experiences.
It also promotes exposure to previously avoided situations that have caused anxiety in order to promote acceptance.
The avoidant behavior is treated by having clients observing their thoughts and accepting that their thoughts are not necessarily harmful.
In general ACT strategies are customized to fit each participant so they obtain psycho-education, problem solving skills and psychological flexibility.
Mindfulness and acceptance exercises and skills facilitate the behavioral changes necessary for its user to pursue a life that they feel is vital and meaningful.
Various sources have indicated that acceptance and commitment therapy overlaps with Neff's conceptualization of self compassion particularly ACT's relational frame theory.
The basic theories and concepts underlining ACT, may be relevant and have shown to be parallels and hold similarities found in self-compassion The first is ACT's perspective and Neff's concept of self-kindness are both linked to self-acceptance.
Acceptance of one's painful experiences and hurt is related to kindness to one's self.
Second Neff's conceptualization of self-compassion and ACT both emphasize mindfulness, which is practiced in ACT through the concepts of defusion, acceptance, contact with the present moment and the self as a context.
Defusion is also used in self-compassion as a means of allowing self-criticisms to pass through the mind without believing, proving them wrong or engaging in a stance to make these thoughts workable.
In a study conducted by Yadavaia, Hayes &amp; Vilardaga, 2014 test the efficacy of an ACT approach to self-compassion as compared to a waitlist control, the study showed that ACT interventions led to a large increase in self-compassion and psychopathology compared to the waitlist control at post-treatment and two months post intervention.
Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy 
Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an approach to psychotherapy that uses cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) methods in collaboration with mindfulness meditative practices and similar psychological strategies.
The origins to its conception and creation can be traced back to the traditional approaches from East Asian formative and functional medicine, philosophy and spirituality, birthed from the basic underlying tenets from classical Taoist, Buddhist and Traditional Chinese medical texts, doctrine and teachings.
Recently, mindfulness therapy has become of great interest to the scientific and medical community in the West, leading to the development of many new innovative approaches to mental health.
One such approach is the relapse-prevention treatment for individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD).
A focus on MDD and attention to negative thought processes such as false beliefs and rumination, distinguishes MBCT from other mindfulness-based therapies.
Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), for example, is a more generalized program that also utilizes the practice of mindfulness.
MBSR is a group-intervention program, like MBCT, that uses mindfulness to help improve the lives of individuals with chronic clinical ailments and high-stress.
CBT-inspired methods are used in MBCT, such as educating the participant about depression and the role that cognition plays within it.
MBCT takes practices from CBT and applies aspects of mindfulness to the approach.
One example would be "decentering", a focus on becoming aware of all incoming thoughts and feelings and accepting them, but not attaching or reacting to them.
This process aims to aid an individual in disengaging from self-criticism, rumination, and dysphoric moods that can arise when reacting to negative thinking patterns.
Like CBT, MBCT functions on the etiological theory that when individuals who have historically had depression become distressed, they return to automatic cognitive processes that can trigger a depressive episode.
The goal of MBCT is to interrupt these automatic processes and teach the participants to focus less on reacting to incoming stimuli, and instead accepting and observing them without judgment.
Like MBSR, this mindfulness practice encourages the participant to notice when automatic processes are occurring and to alter their reaction to be more of a reflection.
With regard to development, MBCT emphasizes awareness of thoughts, which helps individuals recognize negative thoughts that lead to rumination.
It is theorized that this aspect of MBCT is responsible for the observed clinical outcomes.
Beyond the use of MBCT to reduce depressive symptoms, a meta-analysis done by Chiesa and Serretti (2014) supports the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation in reducing cravings for individuals with substance abuse issues.
Addiction is known to involve interference with the prefrontal cortex, which ordinarily allows for delaying of immediate gratification for longer-term benefits by the limbic and paralimbic brain regions.
The nucleus accumbens, together with the ventral tegmental area, constitutes the central link in the reward circuit.
The nucleus accumbens is also one of the brain structures that is most closely involved in drug dependency.
In an experiment with smokers, mindfulness meditation practiced over a two-week period totaling five hours of meditation decreased smoking by about 60% and reduced their cravings, even for those smokers who had no prior intentions to quit.
Neuroimaging among those who practice mindfulness meditation reveals increased activity in the prefrontal cortex.
Background.
The tradition of mindful cognitive learning has been an important part of Buddhist and Taoist practices and tradition for thousands of years in East Asia, it is an important component of Traditional Chinese medicine and used extensively in Daoyin, Taiqi, Qigong and Wuxing heqidao as a therapy based on traditional intersectional medicine for prevention and treatment of mind and body disease, pain, and suffering.
In 1991, Philip Barnard and John Teasdale created a multilevel concept of the mind called "Interacting Cognitive Subsystems" (ICS).
The ICS model is based on Barnard and Teasdale's concept that the mind has multiple modes that are responsible for receiving and processing new information cognitively and emotionally.
This concept associates an individual's vulnerability to depression with the degree to which he/she relies on only one of the modes of mind, inadvertently blocking the other modes.
The two main modes of mind are the "doing" mode and the "being" mode.
The "doing" mode is also known as the "driven" mode.
This mode is very goal-oriented and is triggered when the mind develops a discrepancy between how things are and how the mind wishes things to be.
The second main mode of mind is the "being" mode.
This mode is not focused on achieving specific goals; instead, the emphasis is on "accepting and allowing what is," without any immediate pressure to change it.
The central component of ICS is metacognitive awareness: the ability to experience negative thoughts and feelings as mental events that pass through the mind, rather than as a part of the self.
Individuals with high metacognitive awareness are able to avoid depression and negative thought patterns more easily during stressful life situations, in comparison with individuals with low metacognitive awareness.
Meta-cognitive awareness is regularly reflected through an individual's ability to decenter.
Decentering is the ability to perceive thoughts and feelings as both impermanent and objective occurrences in the mind.
In Barnard and Teasdale's (1991) model, mental health is related to an individual's ability to disengage from one mode or to easily move among the modes of mind.
Individuals who are able to flexibly move between the modes of mind based on conditions in the environment are in the most favorable state.
The ICS model theorizes that the "being" mode is the most likely mode of mind that will lead to lasting emotional changes.
Therefore, to prevent relapse in depression, cognitive therapy must promote this mode.
This led Teasdale to the creation of MBCT, which promotes the "being" mode.
This therapy was also created by Zindel Segal and Mark Williams and was partially based on the mindfulness-based stress reduction program, developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn.
The theories behind mindfulness-based approaches to psychological issues function on the idea that being aware of things in the present, and not focusing on the past or the future, will allow the individual to be more apt to deal with current stressors and distressing feelings with a flexible and accepting mindset, rather than avoiding and, therefore, prolonging them.
Applications.
The MBCT program is a group intervention that lasts eight weeks, or in eight sessions.
During these eight weeks, there is a weekly course, which lasts two hours, and one day-long class after the fifth week.
However, much of the practice is done outside class, with the participant using guided meditations and attempts to cultivate mindfulness in their daily lives.
MBCT prioritizes learning how to pay attention or concentrate with purpose, in each moment and, most importantly, without judgment.
Through mindfulness, clients can recognize that holding onto some of these feelings is ineffective and mentally destructive.
MBCT focuses on having individuals recognize and be aware of their feelings instead of focusing on changing feelings.
Mindfulness is also thought by Fulton et al. to be useful for the therapists during therapy sessions.
MBCT is an intervention program developed to specifically target vulnerability to depressive relapse.
Throughout the program, patients learn mind management skills leading to heightened meta-cognitive awareness, acceptance of negative thought patterns, and an ability to respond in skillful ways.
During MBCT patients learn to decenter their negative thoughts and feelings, allowing the mind to move from an automatic thought pattern to conscious emotional processing.
MBCT can be used as an alternative to maintenance antidepressant treatment, though it may be no more effective.
Although the primary purpose of MBCT is to prevent relapse in depressive symptomology, clinicians have been formulating ways in which MBCT can be used to treat physical symptoms of other diseases, such as diabetes and cancer.
Clinicians are also discovering ways to use MBCT to treat the anxiety and weariness associated with these diseases.
Evaluation of effectiveness.
A meta-analysis by Jacob Piet and Esben Hougaard of the University of Aarhus, Denmark Research found that MBCT could be a viable option for individuals with MDD in preventing a relapse.
Various studies have shown that it is most effective with individuals who have a history of at least three or more past episodes of MDD.
Within that population, participants with life-event-triggered depressive episodes were least receptive to MBCT.
According to a 2017 meta-analysis of 547 patients, mindfulness-based interventions support a 30-60% decrease in depressive and anxious symptoms, in addition to the overall level of patient stress.
An MBCT-based program offered by the Tees, Esk, and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust showed that measures of psychological distress, risk of burnout, self-compassion, anxiety, worry, mental well-being, and compassion for others all showed significant improvements after completing the program.
Research supports that MBCT results in increased self-reported mindfulness, which suggests increased present-moment awareness, decentering, and acceptance, in addition to decreased maladaptive cognitive processes such as judgment, reactivity, rumination, and thought suppression.
Results of a 2017 meta-analysis highlight the importance of home practice and its relation to conducive outcomes for mindfulness-based interventions.
Experiment with Light 
Experiment with Light is a Quaker spiritual practice.
It refers back to seventeenth century Quakers' experience, rediscovered as a systematic discipline in 1996.
Experiment with Light is often practised in Quaker meetings in Light groups, but it can also be undertaken as a solo discipline and it is not necessary to be a Quaker to practise it.
Recordings of the different versions of the meditation are available on CD and as downloads from the Experiment with Light website.
The website Experiment with Light also provides details of resources and events as well as the guided meditations.
It also holds the latest online editions of the Experiment with Light Journal.
There are Android or Apple apps that can be downloaded to play recordings of the meditations on a mobile phone.
Development.
"Light to Live by" describes how British Quaker Rex Ambler first became aware of seventeenth century Quaker insight and how, as a result, he devised the Experiment.
"Seeing Hearing Knowing: reflections on Experiment with Light" is a collection of articles describing different writers' experience of it.
In 2011 the Quaker weekly Journal "The Friend" (Quaker Magazine) ran a series of articles about it.
"Mind the Light: the story of a Quaker discipline" details the origins and history of its development from 1996 to 2017.
In Britain there is an Experiment with Light Network, which is a Quaker Recognised Body of Britain Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends.
There is a North America Experiment with Light Network and it is also practised in Quaker Meetings in Australia, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Norway, Denmark and Sweden.
It can be, and is, undertaken by people who are not Quakers as well.
Process.
At the heart of the practice is a meditation which guides Experimenters through four core steps (although the words suggesting each step differ in the various versions): 
Henosis 
Henosis () is the classical Greek word for mystical "oneness", "union" or "unity".
In Neoplatonism, henosis is unification with what is fundamental in reality: the One (Τὸ Ἕν), the Source, or Monad.
The Neoplatonic concept has precedents in the Greek mystery religions as well as parallels in Eastern philosophy.
It is further developed in the Corpus Hermeticum, in Christian theology, Islamic Mysticism, soteriology and mysticism, and is an important factor in the historical development of monotheism during Late Antiquity.
Etymology.
The term is relatively common in classical texts, and has the meaning of "union" or "unity".
Process of unification.
Henosis, or primordial unity, is rational and deterministic, emanating from indeterminism an uncaused cause.
Each individual as a microcosm reflects the gradual ordering of the universe referred to as the macrocosm.
In mimicking the demiurge (divine mind), one unites with The One or Monad.
Thus the process of unification, of "The Being" and "The One", is called henosis, the culmination of which is deification.
Plotinus.
Henosis for Plotinus (204/5–270 CE) was defined in his works as a reversing of the ontological process of consciousness via meditation (or contemplation) toward no thought (nous or demiurge) and no division (dyad) within the individual (being).
As is specified in the writings of Plotinus on Henology, one can reach a tabula rasa, a blank state where the individual may grasp or merge with The One.
This absolute simplicity means that the nous or the person is then dissolved, completely absorbed back into the Monad.
Within the "Enneads" of Plotinus, the Monad can be referred to as the Good above the demiurge.
The Monad or dynamis (force) is of one singular expression (the will or the one is the good), all is contained in the Monad and the Monad is all and in all (panentheism).
All division is reconciled in the one, the final stage before reaching singularity, and what is called duality (dyad) is completely reconciled in the Monad, Source or One (see monism).
As the source or substance of all things, the Monad is all encompassing.
As infinite and indeterminate, all is reconciled in the dynamis or one.
It is the demiurge or second emanation that is the nous in Plotinus.
It is the demiurge (creator, action, energy) or nous that "perceives," and therefore causes the force (potential or One) to manifest as energy, or the dyad called the material world.
Nous as being, being and perception (intellect) manifest what is called soul (World Soul).
Plotinus words his teachings to reconcile not only Plato with Aristotle, but also various world religions that he had personal contact with during his various travels.
Plotinus' works have an ascetic character in that they reject matter as an illusion (non-existent).
Matter was strictly treated as immanent, with matter as essential to its being, having no true or transcendental character or essence, substance or ousia.
This approach is called philosophical Idealism.
Phases.
Plotinus' phases of "mystical union with the One" as given by Mazur (2021): 
Passages in the "Enneads" describing the different stages of mystical union with the One can be found in I.6, IV.8, VI.9, III.8, V.3, V.5, V.8, and VI.7-8.
Iamblichus of Chalcis.
Within the works of Iamblichus of Chalcis (c. 245 – c. 325 AD), The One and reconciliation of division can be obtained through the process of theurgy.
By mimicking the demiurge, the individual is returned to the cosmos to implement the will of the divine mind.
One goes through a series of theurgy or rituals that unites the initiate to the Monad.
These rituals mimic the ordering of the chaos of the Universe into the material world or cosmos.
They also mimic the actions of the demiurge as the creator of the material world.
Iamblichus used the rituals of the mystery religions to perform rituals on the individual to unite their outer and inner person.
Thus one without conflict (whether internal or external) is united (henosis) and is The One (hen).
Puissance spirituelle du verbe 
The Puissance Spirituelle du Verbe (English: "Spiritual Power of the Verb") in acronym PSV, is a so-called spiritual organization for Africa and the awakening of the black man in general, created on February 23, 1980 by Bavua Ntinu and present in 4 African countries.
It is an initiatory order which advocates the spiritual purification of all that exists by cleaning the bodies at the same time spiritual, astral and physical, by the use of sound and divine light, through techniques and codes that allow get in touch with any entity existing but, according to its initiator, the absence of spiritual masters and true prophets in the black race has been lacking for years, which explains the delay experienced by blacks and especially their ignorance of the greatness of the universe, according to him.
Effects of meditation 
The psychological and physiological effects of meditation have been studied.
In recent years, studies of meditation have increasingly involved the use of modern instruments, such as fMRI and EEG, which are able to observe brain physiology and neural activity in living subjects, either during the act of meditation itself or before and after meditation.
Correlations can thus be established between meditative practices and brain structure or function.
Since the 1950s hundreds of studies on meditation have been conducted, but many of the early studies were flawed and thus yielded unreliable results.
Contemporary studies have attempted to address many of these flaws with the hope of guiding current research into a more fruitful path.
In 2013, researchers found moderate evidence that meditation can reduce anxiety, depression, and pain, but no evidence that it is more effective than active treatments such as drugs or exercise.
Another major review article also cautioned about possible misinformation and misinterpretation of data related to the subject.
Effects of mindfulness meditation.
A previous study commissioned by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that meditation interventions reduce multiple negative dimensions of psychological stress.
Other systematic reviews and meta-analyses show that mindfulness meditation has several mental health benefits such as bringing about reductions in depression symptoms, improvements in mood, stress-resilience and attentional control.
Mindfulness interventions also appear to be a promising intervention for managing depression in youth.
Mindfulness meditation is useful for managing stress, anxiety and also appears to be effective in treating substance use disorders.
A recent meta analysis by Hilton et al. (2016) including 30 randomized controlled trials found high quality evidence for improvement in depressive symptoms.
Other review studies have shown that mindfulness meditation can enhance the psychological functioning of breast cancer survivors, is effective for people with eating disorders and may also be effective in treating psychosis.
Studies have also shown that rumination and worry contribute to mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety, and mindfulness-based interventions are effective in the reduction of worry.
Some studies suggest that mindfulness meditation contributes to a more coherent and healthy sense of self and identity, when considering aspects such as sense of responsibility, authenticity, compassion, self-acceptance and character.
Brain mechanisms.
The analgesic effect of mindfulness meditation may involve multiple brain mechanisms, but there are too few studies to allow conclusions about its effects on chronic pain.
Changes in the brain.
Mindfulness meditation is under study for whether structural changes in the brain may occur, but most studies have weak methodology.
A meta-analysis found preliminary evidence for effects in the prefrontal cortex and other brain regions associated with body awareness.
However, the results should be interpreted with caution because funnel plots indicate that publication bias is an issue in meditation research.
A 2016 review using 78 functional neuroimaging studies suggests that different meditation styles are associated with different brain activity.
Attention and mindfulness.
Attention networks and mindfulness meditation.
Psychological and Buddhist conceptualizations of mindfulness both highlight awareness and attention training as key components, in which levels of mindfulness can be cultivated with practise of mindfulness meditation.
Focused attention meditation (FAM) and open monitoring meditation (OMM) are distinct types of mindfulness meditation; FAM refers to the practice of intently maintaining focus on one object, whereas OMM is the progression of general awareness of one's surroundings while regulating thoughts.
Focused attention meditation is typically practiced first to increase the ability to enhance attentional stability, and awareness of mental states with the goal being to transition to open monitoring meditation practise that emphasizes the ability to monitor moment-by-moment changes in experience, without a focus of attention to maintain.
Mindfulness meditation may lead to greater cognitive flexibility.
In an active randomized controlled study completed in 2019, participants who practiced mindfulness meditation demonstrated a greater improvement in awareness and attention than participants in the active control condition.
Alpha wave neural oscillation power (which is normally associated with an alert resting state) has been shown to be increased by mindfulness in both healthy subjects and patients.
Sustained attention.
Tasks of sustained attention relate to vigilance and the preparedness that aids completing a particular task goal.
Psychological research into the relationship between mindfulness meditation and the sustained attention network have revealed the following: 
Emotion regulation and mindfulness.
Research shows meditation practices lead to greater emotional regulation abilities.
Mindfulness can help people become more aware of thoughts in the present moment, and this increased self-awareness leads to better processing and control over one's responses to surroundings or circumstances.
Positive effects of this heightened awareness include a greater sense of empathy for others, an increase in positive patterns of thinking, and a reduction in anxiety.
Reductions in rumination also have been found following mindfulness meditation practice, contributing to the development of positive thinking and emotional well-being.
Evidence of mindfulness and emotion regulation outcomes.
Emotional reactivity can be measured and reflected in brain regions related to the production of emotions.
It can also be reflected in tests of attentional performance, indexed in poorer performance in attention related tasks.
The regulation of emotional reactivity as initiated by attentional control capacities can be taxing to performance, as attentional resources are limited.
Controversies in mindful emotion regulation.
It is debated as to whether top-down executive control regions such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), are required or not to inhibit reactivity of the amygdala activation related to the production of evoked emotional responses.
Arguably an initial increase in activation of executive control regions developed during mindfulness training may lessen with increasing mindfulness expertise.
Stress reduction.
Research has shown stress reduction benefits from mindfulness.
A 2019 study tested the effects of meditation on the psychological well-being, work stress, and blood pressure of employees working in the United Kingdom.
One group of participants were instructed to meditate once a day using a mindfulness app on their smartphones, while the control group did not engage in meditation.
Measurements of well-being, stress, and perceived workplace support were taken for both groups before the intervention and then again after four months.
Based on self-report questionnaires, the participants who engaged in meditation showed a significant increase in psychological well-being and perceived workplace support.
The meditators also reported a significant decrease in anxiety and stress levels.
Another study conducted to understand association between mindfulness, perceived stress and work engagement indicated that mindfulness was associated with lower perceived stress and higher work engagement.
Other research shows decreased stress levels in people who engage in meditation after shorter periods of time as well.
Evidence of significant stress reduction was found after only three weeks of meditation intervention.
Brief, daily meditation sessions can alter one's behavioral response to stressors, improving coping mechanisms and decreasing the adverse impact caused by stress.
A study from 2016 examined anxiety and emotional states of naive meditators before and after a seven-day meditation retreat in Thailand.
Results displayed a significant reduction in perceived stress after this traditional Buddhist meditation retreat.
Insomnia and sleep.
Chronic insomnia is often associated with anxious hyperarousal and frustration over inability to sleep.
Mindfulness has been shown to reduce insomnia and improve sleep quality, although self-reported measures show larger effects than objective measures.
Future directions.
A large part of mindfulness research is dependent on technology.
As new technology continues to be developed, new imaging techniques will become useful in this field.
Real-time fMRI might give immediate feedback and guide participants through the programs.
It could also be used to more easily train and evaluate mental states during meditation itself.
Effects of other types of meditation.
Insight (Vipassana) meditation.
Vipassana meditation is a component of Buddhist practice.
Phra Taweepong Inwongsakul and Sampath Kumar from the University of Mysore have been studying the effects of this meditation on 120 students by measuring the associated increase of cortical thickness in the brain.
The results of this study are inconclusive.
Vipassana meditation leads to more than just mindfulness, but has been found to reduce stress, increase well-being and self-kindness.
These effects were found to be most powerful short-term, but still had a relatively significant impact six months later.
In a study conducted by Szekeres and Wertheim (2014), they found stress to be the category that seemed to have the most regression, but the others contained higher prevalence when compared to the participants' original scores that were given before embarking on Vipassana meditation.
Overall, according to self-reports, Vipassana can have short and long-term effects on an individual.
EEG studies on Vipassana meditators seemed to indicate significant increase in parieto-occipital gamma rhythms in experienced meditators (35–45 Hz).
In another study conducted by NIMHANS on Vipassana meditators, researchers found readings associated with improved cognitive processing after a session of meditation, with distinct and graded difference in the readings between novice meditators and experienced meditators.
An essential component to the Vipassana mediation approach is the focus on awareness, referring to bodily sensations and psychological status.
In a study conducted by Zeng et al. (2013), awareness was described as the acknowledgement of consciousness which is monitoring all aspects of the environment.
This definition differentiates the concept of awareness from mindfulness.
The emphasis on awareness, and the way it assists in monitoring emotion, is unique to this meditative practice.
Kundalini yoga.
Kundalini yoga has proved to increase the prevention of cognitive decline and evaluate the response of biomarkers to treatment, thereby shedding light on the underlying mechanisms of the link between Kundalini Yoga and cognitive impairment.
For the study, 81 participants aged 55 and older who had subjective memory complaints and met criteria for mild cognitive impairment, indicated by a total score of 0.5 on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale.
The results showed that at 12 weeks, both the yoga group showed significant improvements in recall memory and visual memory and showed a significant sustained improvement in memory up to the 24-week follow-up, the yoga group showed significant improvement in verbal fluency and sustained significant improvements in executive functioning at week 24.
In addition, the yoga cohort showed significant improvement in depressive symptoms, apathy, and resilience from emotional stress.
This research was provided by Helen Lavretsky, M.D. and colleagues.
In another study, Kundalini Yoga did not show significant effectiveness in treating obsessive-compulsive disorders compared with Relaxation/Meditation.
Sahaja yoga and mental silence.
Sahaja yoga meditation is regarded as a mental silence meditation, and has been shown to correlate with particular brain and brain wave characteristics.
One study has led to suggestions that Sahaja meditation involves 'switching off' irrelevant brain networks for the maintenance of focused internalized attention and inhibition of inappropriate information.
Sahaja meditators appear to benefit from lower depression and scored above control group for emotional well-being and mental health measures on SF-36 ratings.
A study comparing practitioners of Sahaja Yoga meditation with a group of non-meditators doing a simple relaxation exercise, measured a drop in skin temperature in the meditators compared to a rise in skin temperature in the non-meditators as they relaxed.
The researchers noted that all other meditation studies that have observed skin temperature have recorded increases and none have recorded a decrease in skin temperature.
This suggests that Sahaja Yoga meditation, being a mental silence approach, may differ both experientially and physiologically from simple relaxation.
Transcendental Meditation.
The first Transcendental Meditation (TM) research studies were conducted at UCLA and Harvard University and published in "Science" and the "American Journal of Physiology" in 1970 and 1971.
However, much research has been of poor quality, including a high risk for bias due to the connection of researchers to the TM organization and the selection of subjects with a favorable opinion of TM.
Independent systematic reviews have not found health benefits for TM exceeding those of relaxation and health education.
A 2013 statement from the American Heart Association described the evidence supporting TM as a treatment for hypertension as Level IIB, meaning that TM "may be considered in clinical practice" but that its effectiveness is "unknown/unclear/uncertain or not well-established".
In another study, TM proved comparable with other kinds of relaxation therapies in reducing anxiety.
Practitioners of TM have demonstrated a one Hertz reduction in EEG alpha wave frequency relative to controls.
Research on unspecified or multiple types of meditation.
Brain activity.
The medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices have been found to be relatively deactivated during meditation by experienced meditators using concentration, lovingkindness and choiceless awareness meditation.
In addition experienced meditators were found to have stronger coupling between the posterior cingulate, dorsal anterior cingulate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices both when meditating and when not meditating.
Over time meditation can actually increase the integrity of both gray and white matter.
The added amount of gray matter found in the brain stem after meditation improves communication between the cortex and all other areas within the brain.
Meditation often stimulates a large network of cortical regions including the frontal and parietal regions, lateral occipital lobe, the insular cortex, thalamic nuclei, basal ganglia, and the cerebellum region in the brain.
These parts of the brain are connected with attention and the default network of the brain which is associated to day dreaming.
In addition, both meditation and yoga have been found to have impacts on the brain, specifically the caudate.
Strengthening of the caudate has been shown in meditators as well as yogis.
The increased connectedness of the caudate has potential to be responsible for the improved well-being that is associated with yoga and meditation.
Changes in the brain.
Meditation is under preliminary research to assess possible changes in grey matter concentrations.
Published research suggests that meditation can facilitate neuroplasticity and connectivity in brain regions specifically related to emotion regulation and attention.
Attention/Mind wandering.
Non-directive forms of meditation where the meditator lets their mind wander freely can actually produce higher levels of activity in the default mode network when compared to a resting state or having the brain in a neutral place.
These Non directive forms of meditation allows the meditators to have better control over thoughts during everyday activities or when focusing on specific task due to a reduced frustration at the brains mind wandering process.
When given a specific task, meditation can allow quicker response to changing environmental stimuli.
Meditation can allow the brain to decrease attention to unwanted responses of irrelevant environmental stimuli and a reduces the Stroop effect.
Those who meditate have regularly demonstrated more control on what they focus their attention on while maintaining a mindful awareness on what is around them.
Experienced meditators have been shown to have an increased ability when it comes to conflict monitoring and find it easier to switch between competing stimuli.
Those who practice meditation experience an increase of attentional resources in the brain and steady meditation practice can lead to the reduction of the attentional blink due to a decreased mental exertion when identifying important stimuli.
Perception.
Studies have shown that meditation has both short-term and long-term effects on various perceptual faculties.
In 1984 a study showed that meditators have a significantly lower detection threshold for light stimuli of short duration.
In 2000 a study of the perception of visual illusions by zen masters, novice meditators, and non-meditators showed statistically significant effects found for the Poggendorff Illusion but not for the Müller-Lyer Illusion.
The zen masters experienced a statistically significant reduction in initial illusion (measured as error in millimeters) and a lower decrement in illusion for subsequent trials.
Tloczynski has described the theory of mechanism behind the changes in perception that accompany mindfulness meditation thus: "A person who meditates consequently perceives objects more as directly experienced stimuli and less as concepts…
With the removal or minimization of cognitive stimuli and generally increasing awareness, meditation can therefore influence both the quality (accuracy) and quantity (detection) of perception."
Brown points to this as a possible explanation of the phenomenon: "[the higher rate of detection of single light flashes] involves quieting some of the higher mental processes which normally obstruct the perception of subtle events."
In other words, the practice may temporarily or permanently alter some of the top-down processing involved in filtering subtle events usually deemed noise by the perceptual filters.
Memory.
Meditation enhances memory capacity specifically in the working memory and increases executive functioning by helping participants better understand what is happening moment for moment.
Those who meditate regularly have demonstrated the ability to better process and distinguish important information from the working memory and store it into long-term memory with more accuracy than those who do not practice meditation techniques.
Meditation may be able to expand the amount of information that can be held within working memory and by so doing is able to improve IQ scores and increase individual intelligence.
The encoding process for both audio and visual information has been shown to be more accurate and detailed when meditation is used.
Though there are limited studies on meditation's effects on long-term memory, because of meditations ability to increase attentional awareness, episodic long-term memory is believed to be more vivid and accurate for those who meditate regularly.
Meditation has also shown to decrease memory complaints from those with Alzheimer's disease which also suggests the benefits meditation could have on episodic long-term memory which is linked to Alzheimer's.
Calming and relaxation.
According to an article in "Psychological Bulletin", EEG activity slows as a result of meditation.
Some types of meditation may lead to a calming effect by reducing sympathetic nervous system activity while increasing parasympathetic nervous system activity.
Or, equivalently, that meditation produces a reduction in arousal and increase in relaxation.
Herbert Benson, founder of the Mind-Body Medical Institute, which is affiliated with Harvard University and several Boston hospitals, reports that meditation induces a host of biochemical and physical changes in the body collectively referred to as the "relaxation response".
The relaxation response includes changes in metabolism, heart rate, respiration, blood pressure and brain chemistry.
Benson and his team have also done clinical studies at Buddhist monasteries in the Himalayan Mountains.
Benson wrote "The Relaxation Response" to document the benefits of meditation, which in 1975 were not yet widely known.
Aging.
There is no good evidence to indicate that meditation affects the brain in aging.
Happiness and emotional well-being.
Studies have shown meditators to have higher happiness than control groups, although this may be due to non-specific factors such as meditators having better general self-care.
Positive relationships have been found between the volume of gray matter in the right precuneus area of the brain and both meditation and the subject's subjective happiness score.
A recent study found that participants who engaged in a body-scan meditation for about 20 minutes self-reported higher levels of happiness and decrease in anxiety compared to participants who just rested during the 20-minute time span.
These results suggest that an increase in awareness of one's body through meditation causes a state of selflessness and a feeling of connectedness.
This result then leads to reports of positive emotions.
A technique known as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) displays significant benefits for mental health and coping behaviors.
Participants who had no prior experience with MBSR reported a significant increase in happiness after eight weeks of MBSR practice.
Focus on the present moment and increased awareness of one's thoughts can help monitor and reduce judgment or negative thoughts, causing a report of higher emotional well-being.
The MBSR program and evidence for its effectiveness is described in Jon Kabat-Zinn's book "Full Catastrophe Living".
Pain.
Meditation has been show to reduce pain perception.
An intervention known as mindfulness-based pain management (MBPM) has been subject to a range of studies demonstrating its effectiveness.
Potential adverse effects and limits of meditation.
The understanding of the potential for adverse effects in meditation is evolving.
In 2014, the US government-run National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health suggested that: 
Meditation is considered to be safe for healthy people.
There have been rare reports that meditation could cause or worsen symptoms in people who have certain psychiatric problems, but this question has not been fully researched.
A 2022 update of the same webpage is more cautionary: 
A 2020 review examined 83 studies (a total of 6,703 participants) and found that 55 of those studies reported negative experiences related to meditation practices.
The researchers concluded that about 8 percent of participants had a negative effect from practicing meditation, which is similar to the percentage reported for psychological therapies.
Another 2021 review found negative impacts in 37% of the sampled participants in mindfulness-based programmes, with lasting bad effects in 6–14% of the sample, associated with hyperarousal and dissociation.
More broadly, the potential for adverse effects from meditation is well-documented both in scientific articles and the popular press.
Cases of suicide, self-harm, and significant disturbance among meditation practitioners are also documented in canonical and other historical sources.
Organisations such as Cheetah House and Meditating in Safety document research on problems arising in meditation, and offer help for meditators in distress or those recovering from meditation-related health problems.
In some cases, adverse effects may be attributed to "improper use of meditation" or the aggravation of a preexisting condition; however, developing research in this area suggests the need for deeper engagement with the causes of severe distress, which previous "meditation teachers have perhaps too quickly and rather insensitively dismissed as pre-existing or unrelated psychopathology".
Where meditation is prescribed or offered as a treatment, 
Principles of informed consent require that treatment choice be based in part on the balance of benefits to harms, and therefore can only be made if harms are adequately measured and known.
As with any practice, meditation may also be used to avoid facing ongoing problems or emerging crises in the meditator's life.
In such situations, it may instead be helpful to apply mindful attitudes while actively engaging with current problems.
According to the NIH, meditation should not be used as a replacement for conventional health care or as a reason to postpone seeing a doctor.
Difficulties in the scientific study of meditation.
Weaknesses in historic meditation and mindfulness research.
In June 2007, the United States National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) published an independent, peer-reviewed, meta-analysis of the state of meditation research, conducted by researchers at the University of Alberta Evidence-based Practice Center.
The report reviewed 813 studies involving five broad categories of meditation: mantra meditation, mindfulness meditation, yoga, T'ai chi, and Qigong, and included all studies on adults through September 2005, with a particular focus on research pertaining to hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and substance abuse.
The report concluded: 
It noted that there is no theoretical explanation of health effects from meditation common to all meditation techniques.
A version of this report subsequently published in the "Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine" in 2008 stated: "Most clinical trials on meditation practices are generally characterized by poor methodological quality with significant threats to validity in every major quality domain assessed."
This was despite a statistically significant increase in quality of all reviewed meditation research, in general, over time between 1956 and 2005.
Of the 400 clinical studies, 10% were found to be good quality.
A call was made for rigorous study of meditation.
These authors also noted that this finding is not unique to the area of meditation research and that the quality of reporting is a frequent problem in other areas of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) research and related therapy research domains.
Of more than 3,000 scientific studies that were found in a comprehensive search of 17 relevant databases, only about 4% had randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which are designed to exclude the placebo effect.
In a 2013 meta-analysis, Awasthi argued that meditation is defined poorly and despite the research studies showing clinical efficacy, exact mechanisms of action remain unclear.
A 2017 commentary was similarly mixed, with concerns including the particular characteristics of individuals who tend to participate in mindfulness and meditation research.
Position statements.
A 2013 statement from the American Heart Association (AHA) evaluated the evidence for the effectiveness of TM as a treatment for hypertension as "unknown/unclear/uncertain or not well-established", and stated: "Because of many negative studies or mixed results and a paucity of available trials... other meditation techniques are not recommended in clinical practice to lower BP at this time."
According to the AHA, while there are promising results about the impact of meditation in reducing blood pressure and managing insomnia, depression and anxiety, it is not a replacement for healthy lifestyle changes and is not a substitute for effective medication.
Methodological obstacles.
The term "meditation" encompasses a wide range of practices and interventions rooted in different traditions, but research literature has sometimes failed to adequately specify the nature of the particular meditation practice(s) being studied.
Different forms of meditation practice may yield different results depending on the factors being studied.
The presence of a number of intertwined factors including the effects of meditation, the theoretical orientation of how meditation practices are taught, the cultural background of meditators, and generic group effects complicates the task of isolating the effects of meditation:

Ram Chandra (Lalaji) 
Ram Chandra (Lalaji) (2 February 1873 – 14 August 1931) was a spiritual guide from Fatehgarh Uttar Pradesh India.
He was popularly known as "Lalaji" among his followers.
He is said to have re-discovered the ancient Indian system of transmission called "Pranahuti" (offering of Prana) which is often referred to as “Pranasya Prana” (Life of Life) in the practice of meditation.
After his passing, his disciples started many spiritual organizations like Shri Ram Chandra Mission and Ramashram Satsang.
Also by his disciple Har Narayan Saxena https://harnarayan-saxena.com/ 
Early life, Education and Family.
He was born on February 2, 1873, at Fatehgarh, Uttar Pradesh in North India on the day of "Basant Panchmi" (as per Hindu calendar).
His father, Harbaksh Rai, was a tax superintendent at Farrukhabad.
His mother, Mrs. Durga Devi, was a religious lady, who influenced Ram Chandra towards spirituality in his childhood.
His father belonged to a family of Jagirdars (landlords), but they lost most of their wealth in the post mutiny disturbances at that time, and in a legal battle.
Later Ram Chandra worked with one of his father’s associates in the collector's office at Fatehgarh for his livelihood.
He was married and led a normal family life.
He knew Urdu, Persian, Arabic, Hindi, Sanskrit and English languages.
He completed his education from a Mission School at Farrukhabad.
Spiritual Life.
His interest in spirituality grew during his school days.
The teenager Ram Chandra was married to a noble lady of a respectable family.
His father expired sometime after his marriage.
There was sufficient property left, but he could not live like a rich man as God had willed that he should become a 'Saint' and show the real path to suffering humanity.
He had to abandon his home for a much smaller house.
While he was facing many such tragic occurrences like a stalwart, he came into the contact of a Sufi Master, Hazrat Maulana Fazl Ahmad Khan Sahib R.A. living in a nearby campus named 'Madarsa Mufti Sahib'.
Ram Chandra got initiated [Bay't] on 23rd January 1896 [at 05.00 PM] and got completed ("Taqmil"), declared full-fledged Spiritual Master and the 36th 'Shaykh' into the Hierarchy of Golden Sufi Saints on 11th October 1896 [AD] by the aforesaid Sufi Master, without conversion into Islam.
Ram Chandra (Lalaji) of Fatehgarh UP did not declare anybody as his successor during his lifetime, except a special mention regarding his son, Jagmohan Narain, [in the ‘Vasihatnaama’ i.e. his last ‘will’ signed by him at Fatehgarh on 23rd October 1930 AD.
After his death and during the lifetime of his son, Jagmohan Narain [1901–1944] there was no confusion in accepting him as his de jure heir.
But after the death of the latter, his namesake and one of his adherent disciples, Mahatma Ram Chandra, widely known as Babuji of Shahjahanpur UP declared himself as his successor, initiating from the mention of dictation by Jagmohan Narain [died on 31st August 1944] in a vision after his death, given on Wednesday dated 06th September 1944 in its chapter &lt;laalaajinilayam - Writer of Sahaj Marg script&gt;.
And thereafter, the aforesaid “Babuji” of Shahjahanpur UP incorporated many changes into the original system of Naqshbandi Sufis, said to have with the due permission of his Master, ‘Lalaji’ of Fatehgarh UP, and finally, the system is now known as “Heartfulness” headquartered at ‘Kanha Shanti Vanam’, near Hyderabad India, headed by Shri Kamlesh D Bhai Patel, widely known as “Daaji”.
Lalaji rediscovered the ancient technique of yogic transmission which is also called “Pranahuti” (Upanishadic “Pranasya Pran”).
Pranahuti involves transmitting divine energy from the original source into the heart of the practitioner to expedite his spiritual progress.
When he began imparting spiritual training some school teachers experienced positive changes in their personalities.
The word spread and more people were attracted to Ram Chandra.
He started formal group meditation (Satsang) in 1914.
He continued the work until his death on 14th August 1931.
His spiritual teachings are said to have equally influenced people of all casts and religions in India.
It was believed by his followers that through his simplified and effective training he made it possible for humans to attain their spiritual perfection during their lifetime itself while they lead a normal householder’s life.
Teachings.
Some of his teachings are: 
Purpose of the human life is to realize god and one should attain this purpose in his or her life without fail.
Following.
His disciples started many spiritual organizations like: “SRCM (Shri Ram Chandra Mission)” started by his disciple with the same name as his – “Ram Chandra” of Shahjahanpur ,“Ramashram Satsang” by “Chaturbhuj Sahay”, “ABSS (Akhil Bhartiya Santmat Satsang)” by “Yashpal” and “Ram Samadhi Ashram” by “Thakur Ram Singh Bhati”.

Gondavalekar Maharaj 
Brahmachaitanya (also popularly known as Gondavalekar Maharaj) (19 February 1845 – 22 December 1913) was an Indian Hindu saint and spiritual master.
Brahmachaitanya was a devotee of the Hindu deity Rama and signed his name as "Brahmachaitanya Ramdasi".
He was a disciple of Tukamai, and advocated for japa meditation with the 13-character Ram Naam (name) mantra "" to attain spiritual progress and enlightenment.
Biography.
Early life.
Brahmachaitanya Maharaj was born on 19 February 1845 to Raoji and Gitabai Ghugardare (Kulkarni), a Deshastha Brahmin couple from Gondavale Budruk, a village in present-day Satara district, Maharashtra, India.
His birth name was Ganpati Raoji Ghugardare (Kulkarni).
His family were devotees to Lord Vitthala, a Hindu deity considered an incarnation of Krishna.
His grandfather, Lingopant held the title of Kulkarni (rural record-keeper) of Gondavale during the Maratha Empire regime, which later also became the family name.
During childhood, Ganpati was said to have memorized the Hindu text "Bhagavad Gita."
He was bestowed the title of "Brahmachaitanya" by his master Tukamai.
He is believed to have attained enlightenment at a very young age of 5.
Initiation.
He arrived in Yehalegaon, a village near Nanded, and met Tukamai, who was considered a living synthesis of the three paths to self realization i.e., Jnana Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, and Karma Yoga.
Ganpati stayed with Tukamai for nine months and would obediently follow the latter's instructions.
On the occasion of Ram Navami, Tukamai initiated Ganapati with the mantra "Śrī Rām Jai Rām Jai Jai Rām" ("श्री राम जय राम जय जय राम"), and bestowed upon him the title of "Brahmachaitanya."
Brahmachaitanya later traveled across India to Ujjain, the Himalayan , Ayodhya, Kashi, Calcutta, Indore and Nasik.
During March 1866, Brahmachaitanya returned to Gondavale and accepted "gṛhasthi" or a material lifestyle.
His first wife Saraswati and his son passed away prematurely, and he remarried a daughter of the Deshpande (district record-keeper) of Atpadi.
His second wife was blind from birth and later became known as Aaisaheb.
After given up all their belongings, Brahmachaitanya took his mother, Gitabai, on a pilgrimage to Varanasi and then Ayodhya.
Gitabai is believed to have died in Kashi.
Return to Gondavale.
During later years, Brahmachaitanya continued to expound spiritual methods revolving around devotion to Rama.
Initially, he had a Rama temple built as an extension to his residence.
With time, the number of his disciples and followers increased.
To cater to an increasing number of devotees, he arranged for the construction of Rama, Dattatreya, and Shani temples with an accommodation facility at Gondavale.
He also had Rama temples built in other rural regions of Maharashtra.
Final years.
Brahmachaitanya breathed his last on 22 December 1913, in Gondavale.
Philosophy.
Brahmachaitanya was a proponent of Bhakti Yoga.
His teachings were aligned with that of Samarth Ramdas.
The Ram Nam mantra, originally attributed to Ramdas, was adopted by Brahmachaitanya, and was central to his teachings.
According to S. G. Tulpule, Brahmachaitanya, like saints Mirabai, Ramdas, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and Tulsidas, was a well-known practitioner of reciting the divine name as an incarnation of God.
Brahmachaitanya frequently used "pravachan" and "bhajan" to engage people along the path of devotion.
He encouraged cow protection and food donation.
He was also one of the key figures in the revival of Vedic ritualism ("vaidik anuṣṭhān") in Maharashtra.
Teachings.
Bramhachaitanya advised seekers that one can achieve God through spiritual practices.
The two proven ways for the worldly people to be able to attain eternal bliss with the purity of heart are सत्संगती (company of saints) and नाम (chanting the name of God).
Brahmachaitanya spent his lifetime teaching the importance of Naam Japa.
He advocated the continued remembrance of God through Naam Japa as a means to happiness, contentment and peace.
Brahmachaitanya's teachings are summarized in his "subodh" (sound advice), which is recited in Gondavale and by his followers across the world.
Subodh teachings include: 
The daily discourses of Bramhachaitanya have been compiled into 'Pravachane' book of discourses.
Noted disciples and followers.
Shri K. V. Belsare.
Shri K. V. Belsare, affectionately known as "Baba" (father), was born in a highly educated family in Hyderabad in 1909.
He mastered the scriptures such as the "Bhagavad Gita", "Dasbodh" and "Dnyaneshwari", at an early age and is believed to have memorized all of the 700 "shlokas" of the "Bhagavad Gita" in one week.
He later became a professor of philosophy at Siddhartha college in Mumbai.
His lectures were so popular that students from other disciplines used to line up and the classrooms were often overflowing due to his extraordinary clarity and ability to teach complex subjects in an easy-to-understand manner.
He was initiated by Brahmachaitanya in 1931.
On Brahmachaitanya's orders, Baba became the cornerstone of propagating Maharaj's teachings to a vast population over 60 years through many discourses on topics ranging from meditation to lectures on the "Dnyaneshwari" and "Dasbodh".
He authored more than 50 books in Marathi.
His notable books include the biography of Brahmachaitanya, Upanishdacha Abhyas (studies on Upanishads) and Bhavarthgatha.
D.R. Bendre.
D.R. Bendre (1896 – 1981) was a Kannada poet and recipient of the Jnanpith Award.
Bendre credited Brahmachaitanya for bestowing on him the gift of poetry.
Worship.
Temples.
Brahmachaitanya and his followers built and consecrated many temples around India.
There are also temples dedicated to Brahmachaitanya in Maharashtra as well as in other places in India such as Bangalore (Srinivasanagar), and Hebbali in Dharwad district.
The Ram Nam Japa ritual is held on a daily basis in these temples.
Meditation centre 
A meditation centre is a place where meditation and related activities are practiced either individually or as group.
These centres are located across the world and services are offered either free or with paid admission.
The centres are operated by individuals and organisations.
Objective.
Meditation centres are intended to help people relieve stress.
These centres are located across the world and are usually located away from cities to avoid any type of distractions.
Facilities.
The following facilities are often included in a meditation centre: 
Love-in 
A love-in is a peaceful public gathering focused on meditation, love, music, sex and/or use of recreational drugs.
The term was coined by Los Angeles radio comedian Peter Bergman, who also hosted the first such event on Easter, 26 March 1967 in Elysian Park.
The term.
The term love-in has been interpreted in varying manners, but is often connected to protesting local, social or environmental issues.
Such protests were often held in opposition to the Vietnam War.
As such, love-ins are largely considered a staple of the 1960s hippie counterculture.
More recently the term is occasionally used figuratively to describe a situation in which people shower praise on one another in excess.
Background.
The First "Love-in" was preceded by the "Heavenly Happening", at midnight, on November 16, 1966, on the Sheep Meadow in Central Park, organized by New York Parks Commissioner, Thomas Hoving, and the 'Human Be-In at the Polo Fields in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park on January 14, 1967.
First Love-in on Easter in Elysian Park.
The First "Love-in" started before dawn.
The "Los Angeles Free Press" promoted the event. 15,000 people crowded in a natural amphitheater in Elysian Park, and listened to the psychedelic rock bands Strawberry Alarm Clock, The Peanut Butter Conspiracy, Clear Light, and the Flamin' Groovies.
1967 New York Easter Be-in. 
The New York Easter 1967 be-in was organized by Jim Fouratt an actor, Paul Williams editor of "Crawdaddy!"
magazine, Susan Hartnett head of the Experiments in Art and Technology organization and Chilean poet and playwright Claudio Badal.
Hesychia 
The Greek term hesychia (, ) is a concept that can be translated as "stillness, rest, quiet, silence".
In Christianity.
In hesychasm, an Eastern Orthodox Christian mystical tradition, it refers to the state of stillness and peace that is obtained through contemplation.
Hesychia is a central theme discussed in most hesychast literature works.
Chapter 2 of the "Systematic Sayings of the Desert Fathers" is dedicated to the topic of hesychia.
In Neoplatonism.
The term is also used in Neoplatonic texts such as the "Enneads".
Yangsheng (Daoism) 
In religious Daoism and Traditional Chinese medicine, yangsheng (養生, "nourishing life"), refers to various self-cultivaton practices aimed at enhancing health and longevity.
"Yangsheng" techniques include calisthenics, self-massage, breath exercises, meditation, internal and external Daoist alchemy, sexual activities, and dietetics.
Most "yangsheng" methods are intended to increase longevity, a few to achieve "immortality"— in the specialized Daoist sense of transforming into a "xian" ("transcendent", who typically dies after a few centuries, loosely translated as "immortal").
While common longevity practices (such as eating a healthy diet or exercising) can increase one's lifespan and well-being, some esoteric transcendence practices (such as "grain avoidance" diets where an adept eats only "qi"/breath instead of foodstuffs, or drinking frequently poisonous Daoist alchemical elixirs of life) can ironically be deadly.
Terminology.
The word "yangsheng" is a linguistic compound of two common Chinese words.
"Yǎng" (養) means 
Besides the usual third tone reading "yǎng" this character has an uncommon alternate fourth tone pronunciation "yàng" (養) meaning "support and take care of (especially one's parents)".
For instance, "yàngshēng" occurs in the late 4th-century BCE "Mengzi", "Keeping one's parents when they are alive [養生者] is not worth being described as of major importance; it is treating them decently when they die that is worth such a description."
(1.13, tr. Lau 1970: 130).
Note that the regular and seal characters (e.g., 養) combine a "yáng" (羊, "sheep", originally picturing a ram's head) phonetic component and "shí" (食, "food, feed") radical denoting "feed animals", while the ancient oracle and bronze characters (e.g., 䍩) combine "yáng" (羊, "sheep) and "pū" (攵, "hit lightly; tap") denoting "shepherd; tend sheep".
"Shēng" (生) means 
Ancient characters for "sheng" (生) were pictographs showing a plant growing out of the earth (土).
The unabridged Chinese-Chinese "Hanyu Da Cidian" ("Comprehensive Chinese Word Dictionary"), lexicographically comparable to the "Oxford English Dictionary", gives five definitions of "yǎngshēng" (養生): 
The specialized fourth meaning quotes Zhang Yu's (張預) commentary to "The Art of War" that says, "An army ordinarily likes heights and dislikes depths, values brightness and disparages darkness, nourishes itself on vitality and places itself on solidity.
Thus it will not fall prey to a host of ailments and may be declared 'invincible'."
(9, tr. Mair 2007: 109)].
The "Hanyu Da Cidian" also gives a definition of "yàngshēng" (養生), see the "Mencius" above: 
The idea of "yang" (養, "nourishing") is prominent in Chinese thought.
There is a semantic field that includes "yangsheng" (養生, "nourish life"), "yangxing" (養形, "nourish the body"), "yangshen" (養身, "nourish the whole person"), "yangxing" (養性, "nourish the inner nature"), "yangzhi" (養志, "nourish the will"), and "yangxin" (養心, "nourish the mind") (Despeux 2008: 1148).
Translations.
"Nourishing life" is the common English translation equivalent for "yangsheng".
Some examples of other renderings include "keep in good health; nourish one's vital principle" (DeFrancis 1996), "nurturing vitality", "nourishing the vitality" (Needham and Lu 2000: 72, 115), longevity techniques" (Engelhardt 2000: 74), and "nurturing life”, “cultivating life” (Dear 2012: 1).
Some sinologists translate "yangsheng" and "yangxing" (養性) as "macrobiotic", using English macrobiotic in its original meaning "Inclined or tending to prolong life; relating to the prolongation of life" instead of its more familiar macrobiotic diet meaning, "Of or pertaining to a Zen Buddhist dietary system intended to prolong life, comprising pure vegetable foods, brown rice, etc." ("OED" 2009).
The first example was Alfred Forke's 1907 translation of Wang Chong's 80 CE "Lunheng", mentioned below.
Wang's autobiography says that near the end of his life, "he wrote a book on Macrobiotics [養性] in sixteen chapters.
To keep himself alive, he cherished the vital fluid [養氣]."
(tr. Forke 1907: 348).
Joseph Needham and Lu Gwei-djen say, 
Macrobiotics is a convenient term for the belief that it is possible to prepare, with the aid of botanical, zoological, mineralogical and above all chemical, knowledge, drugs or elixirs ["dan" 丹] which will prolong human life beyond old age ["shoulao" 壽老], rejuvenating the body and its spiritual parts so that the adept ["zhenren" 真人] can endure through centuries of longevity ["changsheng" 長生], finally attaining the status of eternal life and arising with etherealised body a true Immortal ["shengxian" 升仙] (Needham and Lu 1974: 11).
Donald Harper translates "yangsheng" and "changsheng" (長生, "long life") in the Mawangdui Silk Texts as "macrobiotic hygiene" (2009).
"Changsheng" is used in the Mawangdui medical manuscripts to designate "a somatic form of hygiene centering mainly on controlled breathing in conjunction with yogic exercises", comparable with the classical Greek gymnosophists (Collins and Kerr 2001: 14).
Historical developments.
Information about "yangsheng" "nourishing life" health cultivation was traditionally limited to received texts including the Chinese classics, until this corpus was augmented by some second-century BCE medical manuscripts discovered in the 1970s.
Han manuscripts.
In Western Han dynasty (202 BCE – 9 CE) tombs, Chinese archeologists excavated manuscript copies of ancient texts, some previously unknown, which included several historically important medical books that came to be known as the "medical manuals."
Scribes occasionally copied texts on valuable silk but usually on bamboo and wooden slips, which were the common media for writing documents in China before the widespread introduction of paper during the Eastern Han (25 BCE–220 CE).
Fifteen medical manuscripts, among the Mawangdui Silk Texts, were excavated in 1973 at the Mawangdui archaeological site (modern Changsha, Hunan).
Two others, among the Zhangjiashan Han bamboo texts, were discovered in 1983 at Mount Zhangjia (張家山) (Jiangling County, Hubei).
Both locations were in the Han-era Changsha Kingdom (202 BCE-33 CE) (Engelhardt 2000: 85-86).
The Mawangdui manuscripts were found in a tomb dated 168 BCE, while Harper places the redaction of the manuscripts in the third century BCE (1998: 4).
Six of the fifteen texts can be directly related to the "yangsheng" medical tradition of nourishing life.
Two, the "He yinyang" (合陰陽, "Conjoining Yin and Yang") and the "Tianxia zhidao tan" (天下至道谈, "Discussion of the Perfect Way in All Under Heaven"), mainly focus on techniques of sexual cultivation.
Two others, the "Yangshengfang" (養生方, "Recipes for Nourishing Life") and the "Shiwen" (十問, "Ten Questions"), similarly have sections on sexology, but also discuss breathing techniques, food therapies, and medicines (Harper 1998: 22-30).
The "Quegu shiqi" (卻穀食氣, "The Rejection of Grains and Absorption of "Qi") deals mainly with techniques of eliminating grains and ordinary foodstuffs from the diet and replacing them with medicinal herbs and "qi" through special "fuqi" (服氣, "breath ingestion") exercises.
The text repeatedly contrasts "those who eat "qi"" with "those who eat grain" and explains this in cosmological terms, "Those who eat grain eat what is square; those who eat "qi" eat what is round.
Round is heaven; square is earth."
(tr. Harper 1998: 130).
The "Daoyin tu" (導引圖, "Gymnastics Chart") above contains color illustrations of human figures performing therapeutic gymnastics.
Some of the recognizable captions refer to the names of exercises, such as "xiongjing" (熊經, "bear hangs") and "niaoshen" (鳥伸, "bird stretches"), mentioned in the "Zhuangzi" and other texts below (Engelhardt 2000: 86).
The Zhangjiashan cache of manuscripts written on bamboo slips were excavated from a tomb dated 186 BCE, and contained two medical books.
The "Maishu" (脈書, "Book on Meridians") comprises several texts that list ailments and describe the eleven (not modern twelve) meridian channels.
The collection is closely related to the Mawangdui meridian texts and both briefly describe "yangsheng" practices of nourishing life.
The "Yinshu" (引書, "Book on Pulling") outlines a daily and seasonal health regimen, including hygiene, dietetics, and sleeping; then it details fifty-seven preventative and curative gymnastic exercises, and massage techniques; and concludes with the etiology and the prevention of diseases.
The text recommends various therapies, such as breathing exercises, bodily stretches, and careful treatment of the interior "qi".
It says: "If you can pattern your "qi" properly and maintain your "yin" energy in fullness, then. the whole person will benefit".
The "Yinshu" considered longevity techniques as limited to the aristocracy and upper classes, and makes a distinction between "upper class people" who fall ill owing to uncontrolled emotions such as extreme joy or rage, and less-fortunate individuals whose diseases tend to be caused by excessive labor, hunger, and thirst.
Since the latter have no opportunity to learn the essential breathing exercises, they consequently become sick and die an early death.
(Engelhardt 2000: 88).
The "Yinshu" manuscript is the "earliest known systematized description of therapeutic exercise in China, and possibly anywhere in the world."
(Yang 2022: 110).
Han texts.
Classics from the Han dynasty (202 BCE-220 CE) first mentioned "yangsheng" techniques.
The Daoist "Zhuangzi" has early descriptions of "yangsheng", notably Chapter 3 titled "Yangsheng zhu" (養生主, "Essentials for Nurturing Life"), which is in the pre-Han "Inner Chapters" attributed to Zhuang Zhou (c. 369-286 BCE).
In the fable about Lord Wenhui (文惠君) coming to understand the Dao while watching Cook Ding (庖丁) cut up an ox, he exclaims how wonderful it is "that skill can attain such heights!"
The cook replies, "What your servant loves is the Way, which goes beyond mere skill.
When I first began to cut oxen, what I saw was nothing but whole oxen.
After three years, I no longer saw whole oxen.
Today, I meet the ox with my spirit rather than looking at it with my eyes.
My sense organs stop functioning and my spirit moves as it pleases.
In accord with the natural grain [依乎天理], I slice at the great crevices, lead the blade through the great cavities.
Following its inherent structure, I never encounter the slightest obstacle even where the veins and arteries come together or where the ligaments and tendons join, much less from obvious big bones."
...
" "Wonderful!"
said Lord Wenhui.
"From hearing the words of the cook, I have learned how to nourish life [養生]."
(3, tr. Mair 1994: 26-27)  
Two other "Zhuangzi" chapters mention "yangsheng".
In the former context, Duke Wei (威公), the younger brother of King Kao of Zhou (r. 440-426 BCE), asked Tian Kaizhi (田開之) what he had learned from his master Zhu Shen (祝腎, "Worthy Invoker"), who replied, "I have heard my master say, 'He who is good at nurturing life [善養生者] is like a shepherd [牧羊].
If he sees one of his sheep lagging behind, he whips it forward'."
In order to explain what this means, Tian contrasted a frugal Daoist hermit named Solitary Leopard (單豹) who lived in the cliffs, only drank water, and was healthy until the age of seventy when a tiger killed him, with a wealthy businessman named Chang Yi (張毅) who rushed about in search of profits, but died of typhoid fever at the age of forty.
"Leopard nourished his inner being and the tiger ate his outer person.
Yi nourished his outer person and sickness attacked his inner being.
Both of them failed to whip their laggards forward."
(19, tr. Mair 1994: 179).
This shepherding wordplay recalls the ancient characters for "yang" (養, "nourish"), such as 䍩 combining "yáng" (羊, "sheep") and "pū" (攵, "hit lightly; tap") denoting "shepherd; tend sheep", discussed above.
The latter story concerns the Lord of Lu (魯君) who heard that the Daoist Yan He (顏闔) had attained the Way and dispatched a messenger with presents for him.
Yan "was waiting by a rustic village gate, wearing hempen clothing and feeding a cow by himself."
When the messenger tried to convey the gifts, Yan said, "I'm afraid that you heard incorrectly and that the one who sent you with the presents will blame you.
You had better check."
The messenger went back to the ruler, and was told to return with the presents, but he could never again find Yan He, who disliked wealth and honor.
"Judging from this, the achievements of emperors and kings are the leftover affairs of the sages, not that which fulfills the person or nourishes life [完身養生].
Most of the worldly gentlemen of today endanger their persons and abandon life in their greed for things.
Is this not sad?"
(28, tr. Mair 1994: 287-288).
Three "Zhuangzi" chapters mention "yangxing" (養形, "nourishing the body").
One has the earliest Chinese reference to ways of controlling and regulating the breath (Engelhardt 2000: 101).
It describes "daoyin" ("guiding and pulling [of "qi"]") calisthenics that typically involving bending, stretching, and mimicking animal movements (Despeux 2008: 1148).
Blowing and breathing, exhaling and inhaling, expelling the old and taking in the new, bear strides and bird stretches—all this is merely indicative of the desire for longevity.
But it is favored by scholars who channel the vital breath and flex the muscles and joints, men who nourish the physical form [養形] so as to emulate the hoary age of Progenitor P'eng. (15, tr. Mair 1994: 145).
Although the "Zhuangzi" considers physical calisthenics inferior to more meditative techniques, this is a highly detailed description (Engelhardt 2000: 75).
Another "Zhuangzi" chapter describes the limitations of "yangxing" (養形, "nourishing the body") (Maspero 1981: 420-421); "How sad that the people of the world think that nourishing the physical form [養形] is sufficient to preserve life!
But when it turns out that nourishing the physical form [養形]is insufficient for the preservation of life, what in the world can be done that is sufficient?"
(19, tr. Mair 1994: 174-175) 
The 139 BCE "Huainanzi" is an eclectic compilation, attributed to Liu An, from various Hundred Schools of Thought, especially Huang–Lao religious Daoism.
‘’Huainanzi’’ Chapter 7 echoes ‘’Zhuangzi’’ 15 disparaging "yangsheng" techniques because they require external supports.
If you huff and puff, exhale and inhale, blow out the old and pull in the new, practice the Bear Hang, the Bird Stretch, the Duck Splash, the Ape Leap, the Owl Gaze, and the Tiger Stare: This is what is practiced by those who nurture the body [養形].
They are not the practices of those who polish the mind [e.g., the Perfected, 至人].
They make their spirit overflow, without losing its fullness.
When, day and night, without injury, they bring the spring to external things [物], they unite with, and give birth to, the seasons in their own minds. (7.8, tr. Major 2010: 250).
This criticism "gives a fascinating glimpse into the similarities", perceived even in the second century BCE, "between the "qi" cultivation practiced for physical benefits and the "qi" cultivation practiced for more transformative and deeply satisfying spiritual benefits, which seems to have involved more still sitting than active movement."
(Major 2010: 236).
The "Huainanzi" uses the term "yangxing" (養性, "nourishing one's inner nature") to denote mind-body techniques such as dietary regimens, breathing meditation, and macrobiotic yoga.
"Since nature is the controlling mechanism of both consciousness and vitality, 'nourishing one's nature' produces both elevated states of consciousness and beneficial conditions of bodily health and longevity."
(Major 2010: 907).
For instance, 
Tranquility and calmness are that by which the nature is nourished [養性].
Harmony and vacuity are that by which Potency is nurtured [養德].
When what is external does not disturb what is internal, then our nature attains what is suitable to it.
When the harmony of nature is not disturbed, then Potency will rest securely in its position.
Nurturing life [養生] so as to order the age, embracing Potency so as to complete our years, this may be called being able to embody the Way. (2.13, Major 2010: 103).
Another "Huainanzi" context compares five "yang-" "nourish; nurture" techniques.
In governing the self, it is best to nurture the spirit ["yangshen" 養神].
The next best is to nurture the body ["yangxing" 養形].
In governing the state, it is best to nurture transformation ["yanghua" 養化].
The next best is to correct the laws.
A clear spirit and a balanced will, the hundred joints all in good order, constitute the root of nurturing vitality ["yangxing" 養性].
To fatten the muscles and skin, to fill the bowel and belly, to satiate the lusts and desires, constitute the branches of nurturing vitality ["yangsheng" 養生].” (20.18, tr. Major 2010: 815)  
The circa first century BCE "Huangdi Neijing" ("Inner Classic of the Yellow Emperor") discusses varied healing therapies, including medical acupuncture, moxibustion, and drugs as well as life-nourishing gymnastics, massages, and dietary regulation.
The basic premise of longevity practices, which permeates the entire text "like a red thread", is to avoid diseases by maintaining the vital forces for as long as possible (Engelhardt 2000: 89).
The "Suwen" (素問, "Basic Questions"), section echoes the early immortality cult, and says the ancient sages who regulated life in accordance with the Dao could easily live for a hundred years, yet complained that "these good times are over now, and people today do not know how to cultivate their life".
(Engelhardt 2000: 90).
The astronomer, naturalist, and skeptical philosopher Wang Chong's c. 80 CE "Lunheng" ("Critical Essays") criticizes many Daoist beliefs particularly "yangxing" (養性, "nourishing one's inner nature") (Despeux 2008: 1149).
The "Lunheng" only uses "yangsheng" once; the "All About Ghosts" (訂鬼) chapter explains how heavenly "qi" (tr. "fluid") develops into ghosts and living organisms, "When the fluid is harmonious in itself, it produces and develops things [養生], when it is not, it does injury.
First, it takes a form in heaven, then it descends, and becomes corporeal on earth.
Hence, when ghosts appear, they are made of this stellar fluid."
(tr. Forke 1907: 241).
Wang Chong's "Taoist Untruths" (道虛) chapter (tr. Forke 1907: 332-350) debunks several "yangsheng" practices, especially taking "immortality" drugs, "bigu" grain avoidance, and Daoist yogic breathing exercises.
Daoist "waidan" alchemists frequently compounded elixirs of "immortality", some of which contained lethal ingredients such as mercury and arsenic that could cause elixir poisoning or death.
One "Lunheng" anti-drug passage repeats the phrase "tunyao yangxing" (吞藥養性, "gulp down drugs and nourish one's nature") in a botanical example of natural aging.
The human hair and beard, and the different colours of things, when young and old, afford another cue.
When a plant comes out, it has a green colour, when it ripens, it looks yellow.
As long as man is young, his hair is black, when he grows old, it turns white.
Yellow is the sign of maturity, white of old age.
After a plant has become yellow, it may be watered and tended ever so much, it does not become green again.
When the hair has turned white, no eating of drugs nor any care bestowed upon one’s nature [吞藥養性] can make it black again.
Black and green do not come back, how could age and decrepitude be laid aside? ...
Heaven in developing things can keep them vigorous up till autumn, but not further on till next spring.
By swallowing drugs and nourishing one's nature [吞藥養性] one may get rid of sickness, but one cannot prolong one's life, and become an immortal. (tr. Forke 1907: 337).
Admitting that while some medicines could improve one's health, Wang Chong denied that any could transform one into a "xian" transcendent.
The Taoists sometimes use medicines [服食藥物] with a view to rendering their bodies more supple and their vital force stronger, hoping thus to prolong their years and to enter a new existence.
This is a deception likewise.
There are many examples that by the use of medicines the body grew more supple and the vital force stronger, but the world affords no instance of the prolongation of life and a new existence following. …
The different physics cure all sorts of diseases.
When they have been cured, the vital force is restored, and then the body becomes supple again.
According to man’s original nature his body is supple of itself, and his vital force lasts long of its own accord. …
Therefore, when by medicines the various diseases are dispelled, the body made supple, and the vital force prolonged, they merely return to their original state, but it is impossible to add to the number of years, let alone the transition into another existence. (tr. Forke 1907: 349).
The "Taoist Untruths" chapter describes Daoist grain-free diets in terms of "bigu" (辟穀, "avoiding grains") and "shiqi" (食氣, "eat/ingest breath").
It says that Wangzi Qiao (王子喬), a son of King Ling of Zhou (571-545 BCE), practiced "bigu", as did Li Shaojun (fl. 133 BCE).
The idea prevails that those who abstain from eating grain [辟穀], are men well versed in the art of Tao.
They say e.g., that [Wangzi Qiao] and the like, because they did not touch grain, and lived on different food than ordinary people, had not the same length of life as ordinary people, in so far as having passed a hundred years, they transcended into another state of being, and became immortals.
That is another mistake.
Eating and drinking are natural impulses, with which we are endowed at birth.
Hence the upper part of the body has a mouth and teeth, the inferior part orifices.
With the mouth and teeth one chews and eats, the orifices are for the discharge.
Keeping in accord with one's nature, one follows the law of heaven, going against it, one violates one's natural propensities, and neglects one's natural spirit before heaven.
How can one obtain long life in this way? …
For a man not to eat is like not clothing the body.
Clothes keep the skin warm, and food fills the stomach.
With a warm epidermis and a well-filled belly the animal spirits are bright and exalted.
If one is hungry, and has nothing to eat, or feels cold, and has nothing to warm one’s self, one may freeze or starve to death.
How can frozen and starved people live longer than others?
Moreover, during his life man draws his vital force from food, just as plants and trees do from earth.
Pull out the roots of a plant or a tree, and separate them from the soil, and the plant will wither, and soon die.
Shut a man's mouth, so that he cannot eat, and he will starve, but not be long-lived. (tr. Forke 1907: 347).
Another passage describes "shiqi" (食氣, "eating/ingesting breath", tr. "eats the fluid") as a means to avoid eating grains.
The Taoists exalting each other's power assert that the "pure man" [真人] eats the fluid [食氣], that the fluid is his food.
Wherefore the books say that the fluid-eaters live long, and do not die, that, although they do not feed on cereals, they become fat and strong by the fluid.
This too is erroneous.
What kind of fluid is understood by fluid?
If fluid of the Yin and the Yang be meant, this fluid cannot satiate people.
They may inhale this fluid, so that it fills their belly and bowels, yet they cannot feel satiated.
If the fluid inherent in medicine be meant, man may use and eat a case full of dry drugs, or swallow some ten pills.
But the effects of medicine are very strong.
They cause great pain in the chest, but cannot feed a man.
The meaning must certainly be that the fluid-eaters breathe, inhaling and exhaling, emitting the old air and taking in the new.
Of old, P'êng Tsu used to practise this.
Nevertheless he could not live indefinitely, but died of sickness. (tr. Forke 1907: 347-348).
Besides "shiqi" ("eating "qi"/breath") above, the "Lunheng" also refers to Daoist breath yoga as "daoqi" (導氣, "guide the "qi"/breath").
Many Taoists hold that by regulating one's breath one can nourish one's nature [導氣養性], pass into another state of being, and become immortal.
Their idea is that, if the blood vessels in the body be not always in motion, expanding and contracting, an obstruction ensues.
There being no free passage, constipation is the consequence, which causes sickness and death.
This is likewise without any foundation.
Man’s body is like that of plants and trees. …
When plants and trees, while growing, are violently shaken, they are injured, and pine away.
Why then should man by drawing his breath and moving his body gain a long life and not die?
The blood arteries traverse the body, as streams and rivers flow through the land.
While thus flowing, the latter lose their limpidity, and become turbid.
When the blood is moved, it becomes agitated also, which causes uneasiness.
Uneasiness is like the hardships man has to endure without remedy.
How can that be conducive to a long life? (tr. Forke 1907: 348-349).
The Han Confucian moralist Xun Yue's (148-209) "Shenjian" (申鋻, Extended Reflections) has a viewpoint similar with Wang Chong's interpretation of cultivating the vital principle.
One should seek moderation and harmony and avoid any excesses, and the breath should be circulated to avoid blocks and stagnation, just as the mythical Yu the Great did when he succeeded in quelling the flood waters (Despeux 2008: 1149).
Six Dynasties texts.
During the Six Dynasties (222-589), "yangsheng" continued to develop and diversify in Daoist, "Xuanxue" ("Arcane Learning"), and medical circles.
The polymath Ji Kang (223-262), one of the Daoist Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove, wrote a text titled "Yangsheng lun" (飬生論, "Essays on Nourishing Life").
The early "Zhuangzi" commentator Xiang Xiu (227-272) wrote a criticism with the same title, and Ji replied in his "Danan Yangsheng lun" (答難飬生論, "Answer to [Xiang Xiu's] Refutation of 'Essays on Nourishing Life'").
Ji Kang believed that achieving immortality was attainable, but only for those who have extraordinary "qi", yet even those without it who practice longevity techniques can achieve a lifespan of several hundred years (Engelhardt 2000: 90).
The Daoist scholar Ge Hong's 318 CE "Baopuzi" ("Master Who Embraces Simplicity") describes many techniques of "yangsheng" (養生) and "changsheng" (長生, "longevity"), which Ware (1966) translates as "nurturing of life" and "fullness of life".
Methods of "neixiu" (內修, "inner cultivation") include "tuna" (吐納, "breathing techniques"), "taixi" (胎息, "embryonic breathing"), "daoyin" (導引, "gymnastics"), and "xingqi" (行氣, "circulation of breath/energy"), which are all old forms of what is today known as "qigong" (氣功).
Methods of "waiyang" (外養, "outer nourishment") include "xianyao" (仙藥, "herbs of immortality"), "bigu" (辟穀, "avoiding grains"), "fangzhongshu" (房中術, "bedchamber arts"), "jinzhou" (禁咒, "curses and incantations"), and "fulu" (符籙, "talismanic registers") (Theobald 2010).
Ge Hong quotes the "Huangdi jiuding shendan jing" (黄帝九鼎神丹經, "The Yellow Emperor's Manual of the Nine-Vessel Magical Elixir").
The Yellow Emperor rose into the sky and became a genie after taking this elixir.
It adds that by merely doing the breathing exercises and calisthenics and taking herbal medicines one may extend one's years but cannot prevent ultimate death.
Taking the divine elixir, however, will produce an interminable longevity and make one coeval with sky and earth; it lets one travel up and down in Paradise, riding clouds or driving dragons. (4, tr Ware 1966: 75)  
The "Baopuzi" makes a clear distinction between longevity and immortality, listing three types of immortals: celestial ("tiānxiān", 天仙), earthly ("dìxiān", 地仙), and corpse-liberated ("shījiě xiān", 尸解仙).
Engelhardt says, "The foundation of immortality in any form, then, is a healthy life.
This means that one must avoid all excesses and prevent or heal all diseases."
Taking a fundamentally pragmatic position on "yangsheng" and "changsheng" practices, Ge Hong asserts that "the perfection of any one method can only be attained in conjunction with several others."
(Engelhardt 2000: 77).
The taking of medicines [服藥] may be the first requirement for enjoying Fullness of Life [長生], but the concomitant practice of breath circulation [行氣] greatly enhances speedy attainment of the goal.
Even if medicines [神藥] are not attainable and only breath circulation is practiced, a few hundred years will be attained provided the scheme is carried out fuIly, but one must also know the art of sexual intercourse [房中之術] to achieve such extra years.
If ignorance of the sexual art causes frequent losses of sperm to occur, it will be difficult to have sufficient energy to circulate the breaths. (5, tr. Ware 1966, 105).
There are inherent dangers for adepts who overspecialize in studying a particular technique.
In everything pertaining to the nurturing of life [養生] one must learn much and make the essentials one's own; look widely and know how to select.
There can be no reliance upon one particular specialty, for there is always the danger that breadwinners will emphasize their personal specialties.
That is why those who know recipes for sexual intercourse [房中之術] say that only these recipes can lead to geniehood.
Those who know breathing procedures [吐納] claim that only circulation of the breaths [行氣] can prolong our years.
Those knowing methods for bending and stretching [屈伸] say that only calisthenics can exorcize old age.
Those knowing herbal prescriptions [草木之方] say that only through the nibbling of medicines can one be free from exhaustion.
Failures in the study of the divine process are due to such specializations. (6, tr. Ware 1966: 113).
Ge Hong advises how to avoid illness.
If you are going to do everything possible to nurture your life [養生], you will take the divine medicines [神藥].
In addition, you will never weary of circulating your breaths [行氣]; morning and night you will do calisthenics [導引] to circulate your blood and breaths and see that they do not stagnate.
In addition to these things, you will practice sexual intercourse in the right fashion; you will eat and drink moderately; you will avoid drafts and dampness; you will not trouble about things that are not within your competence.
Do all these things, and you will not fall sick. (15, tr. Ware 1966: 252)  
The "Baopuzi" bibliography lists a no-longer extant "Yangshengshu" (養生書, "Book for Nurturing Life") in 105 "juan" (卷, "scrolls; fascicles; volumes") (Ware 1966: 383).
The Eastern Jin dynasty official and "Liezi" commentator Zhang Zhan 張湛 (fl. 370) wrote one of the most influential works of the Six Dynasties period, the "Yangsheng yaoji" (養生要集, "Essentials of Nourishing Life").
For "yangsheng" health and immortality seekers, this text is said to be equally important as the "Daodejing" and "Huangtingjing" (黃庭經, "Yellow Court Classic"), it was "a widely available source of information for the educated but not necessarily initiated reader", until it was lost during the eighth century (Despeux 2008: 1149).
The "Yangsheng yaoji" is important in the history of "yangsheng" techniques for three reasons: it cites from several earlier works that would have otherwise been lost, it presents a standard textbook model for many later works, and it is the earliest known text to systematize and classify the various longevity practices into one integrated system (Engelhardt 2000: 91).
In the present day, the text survives in numerous fragments and citations, especially in the "Yangxing yanming lu" (養性延命錄, "On Nourishing Inner Nature and Extending Life"), ascribed to Tao Hongjing (456–536), Sun Simiao's 652 "Qianjin fang" (千金方, "Prescriptions Worth a Thousand Gold [Pieces]"), as well as in early Japanese medical texts such as the 984 "Ishinpō" ("Methods from the Heart of Medicine").
(Barrett and Kohn 2008: 1151).
During the Northern and Southern dynasties (420–589), "yangsheng" incorporated Chinese Buddhist meditation techniques (especially "Ānāpānasati" "mindfulness of breathing") and Indian gymnastic exercises.
Daoist "zuowang" ("sitting and forgetting") and "qingjing" (清静, "clarity and stillness") meditating were influenced by Buddhist practices (Despeux 2008: 1149).
Sui to Tang texts.
In the Sui (561-618) and Tang (618-907) dynasties, Daoist and medical circles transmitted essential "yangsheng" techniques for gymnastics and breathing (Despeux 2008: 1149).
The number of medical texts increased significantly from 36 in the Catalog of the Imperial Library of the Han to 256 in the Catalog of the Imperial Library of the Sui (Yang 2002: 111-112).
The 610 "Zhubing yuanhou lun" (諸病源候論, "Treatise on the Origin and Symptoms of Diseases") was compiled upon imperial orders by an editorial committee supervised by the Sui physician and medical author Chao Yuanfang.
This work is of "unprecedented scope", and the first systematic treatise on the etiology and pathology of Chinese medicine.
It categorizes 1,739 diseases according to different causes and clinical symptoms, and most entries cite from an anonymous text titled "Yangsheng fang" (養生方, "Recipes for Nourishing Life"), which closely resembles the fourth-century "Yangsheng yaoji".
The "Zhubing yuanhou lun" does not prescribe standard herbal or acupuncture therapies for clinical cases but rather specific "yangxing" (養性) techniques of hygienic measures, diets, gymnastics, massages, breathing, and visualization (Engelhardt 2000: 79, 91-92).
The famous physician Sun Simiao devoted two chapters (26 "Dietetics" and 27 "Longevity Techniques") of his 652 "Qianjin fang" (千金方, "Prescriptions Worth a Thousand Gold [Pieces]", see above) to life-nourishing methods.
The "Qianjin fang" is a huge compendium of all medical knowledge in the Tang period, the oldest source on Chinese therapeutics that has survived in its entirety, and is still being used to train traditional physicians today (Engelhardt 2000: 93).
Sun also wrote the "Sheyang zhenzhong fang" (攝養枕中方, "Pillow Book of Methods for Nourishing Life") is divided into five parts: prudence, prohibitions, "daoyin" gymnastics, guiding the "qi", and guarding the One ("shouyi" 守一).
The text identifies overindulgence of any sort as the main reason for illness.
(Engelhardt 1989: 280, 294).
Some shorter texts are also attributed to Sun Simiao, including the "Yangxing yanming lu" (養性延命錄, "On Nourishing Inner Nature and Extending Life"), the "Fushou lun" (福壽論, "Essay on Happiness and Longevity"), and the "Baosheng ming" (保生銘, "Inscription on Protecting Life") (Despeux 2008: 1150).
The Daoist Shangqing School patriarch Sima Chengzhen (司馬承禎, 647-735) composed the 730 "Fuqi jingyi lun" (服氣精義論, "Essay on the Essential Meaning of Breath Ingestion"), which presented integrated outlines of health practices, with both traditional Chinese physical techniques and the Buddhist-inspired practice of "guan" (觀, "insight meditation"), as preliminaries for the attainment and realization or the Dao (Engelhardt 2000: 80).
The work relies on both Shangqing religious sources and major medical references such as the "Huangdi Neijing", and groups all the various longevity techniques around the central notion or absorbing "qi".
The practical instructions on specific exercises are supplemented by theoretical medical knowledge, such as the five orbs, healing of diseases, and awareness of symptoms.
(Engelhardt 2000: 93).
Song to Qing texts.
"Yangsheng" practices underwent significant changes from the Song dynasty (960-1279) onward.
They integrated many elements drawn from "neidan" ("inner alchemy") practices, and aroused the interest of scholars.
For the Song dynasty alone, there are about twenty books on the subject.
An important author of the time was Zhou Shouzhong (周守中), who wrote the "Yangsheng leizuan" (養生類纂, "Classified Compendium on Nourishing Life"), the "Yangsheng yuelan" (養生月覽, "Monthly Readings on Nourishing Life"), and other books (Despeux 2008: 1150).
Famous Song literati and poets, such as Su Shi (1007-1072) and Su Dongpo (1037-1101), wrote extensively about their longevity practices.
The Song author Chen Zhi's (陳直) "Yanglao Fengqin Shu" (養老奉親書, "Book on Nourishing Old Age and Taking Care of One's Parents") was the first Chinese work dealing exclusively with geriatrics (Engelhardt 2000: 81).
Along the development of Neo-Confucianism and the growth of syncretism among Daoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism in the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1636–1912) periods, a number of ethical elements were incorporated into "yangsheng" (Despeux 2008: 1150).
During the Ming period, various collections and compendia of longevity writings appeared.
Hu Wenhuan (胡文焕), editor of the 1639 edition "Jiuhuang Bencao" ("Famine Relief Herbal"), wrote the main work on "yangsheng", the c. 1596 "Shouyang congshu" (壽養叢書, "Collectanea on Longevity and Nourishment [of Life]"), which includes the "Yangsheng shiji" (養生食忌, "Prohibitions on Food for Nourishing Life") and the "Yangsheng daoyin fa" (養生導引法, ""Daoyin" Methods for Nourishing Life").
Some works are inclusive treatments of diverse longevity techniques, for example, the dramatist Gao Lian's (fl. 1573-1581) "Zunsheng bajian" (遵生八笺, "Eight Essays on Being in Accord with Life") described "yangsheng" diets, breathing methods, and medicines.
Other works focus entirely on a single method, such as "Tiaoxi fa" (調息法, "Breath Regulation Methods") by the Neo-Confucian philosopher Wang Ji (1498-1582) (Engelhardt 2000: 81).
Another new development under the Ming is the increased integration and legitimization of "yangsheng" techniques into medical literature.
For example, Yang Jizhou's (楊繼洲) extensive 1601 "Zhenjiu dacheng" (針灸大成, "Great Compendium on Acupuncture and Moxibustion"), which remains a classic to the present day, presents gymnastic exercises for the various "qi"-meridians (Engelhardt 2000: 82).
Unlike the Ming dynasty, the Qing dynasty produced no important work on "yangsheng".
In the twentieth century, "yangsheng" evolved into the modern Westernized science of "weisheng" (衛生, "hygiene, health, sanitation") on the one hand, and into "qigong" on the other (Despeux 2008: 1150).
Dear's anthropological study of "yangsgheng"'s popularity and commercialization in early twenty-first century China makes a contrast with "Qigong" fever, a 1980s and 1990s Chinese social phenomenon in which the practice of "qigong" rose to extraordinary popularity, estimated to have reached a peak number of practitioners between 60 and 200 million.
While the Qigong fever had a "somewhat austere and Salvationist aspect", the more recent Yangsheng fever, "which covers so much of the same ground in the quest for health and identity, has a certain low-key decadence about it."
For instance, using the term "yangsheng" to advertise deluxe villas in the suburbs, luxury health spas, extravagantly packaged expensive medicines like "chongcao" (蟲草, "Ophiocordyceps sinensis"), and tourism to naturally beautiful landscapes, "are some of the markers of the new "Yangsheng"."
(Dear 2012: 29).

Pranayama 
Prānāyāma (Sanskrit: प्राणायाम) is the yogic practice of focusing on breath.
In Sanskrit, "prana" means "vital life force", and "yama" means to gain control.
In yoga, breath is associated with "prana", thus, pranayama is a means to elevate the "prana" "shakti", or life energies.
Pranayama is described in Hindu texts such as the "Bhagavad Gita" and the "Yoga Sutras of Patanjali".
Later in Hatha yoga texts, it meant the complete suspension of breathing.
Etymology.
"Prāṇāyāma" (Devanagari: ") is a Sanskrit compound.
It is defined variously by different authors.
Macdonell gives the etymology as prana ("), breath, + "āyāma" and defines it as the suspension of breath.
Monier-Williams defines the compound ' as "of the three 'breath-exercises' performed during ("See" ', ', '".
This technical definition refers to a particular system of breath control with three processes as explained by Bhattacharyya: ' (to take the breath inside), ' (to retain it), and "" (to discharge it).
There are other processes of prāṇāyāma besides this three-step model.
V. S. Apte's definition of ' derives it from ' + ' and provides several variant meanings for it when used in compounds.
The first three meanings have to do with "length", "expansion, extension", and "stretching, extending", but in the specific case of use in the compound ' he defines "" as meaning "restrain, control, stopping".
Ramamurti Mishra gives the definition: 
Hinduism.
"Bhagavad Gītā".
Pranayama is mentioned in verse 4.29 of the "Bhagavad Gītā", which states "Still others, who are inclined to the process of breath restraint to remain in trance, practice by offering the movement of the outgoing breath into the incoming, and the incoming breath into the outgoing, and thus at last remain in trance, stopping all breathing.
Others, curtailing the eating process, offer the outgoing breath into itself as a sacrifice."
"Yoga Sutras of Patanjali".
Pranayama is the fourth "limb" of the eight limbs of Ashtanga Yoga mentioned in verse 2.29 in the "Yoga Sutras of Patanjali".
Patanjali, a Hindu Rishi, discusses his specific approach to pranayama in verses 2.49 through 2.51, and devotes verses 2.52 and 2.53 to explaining the benefits of the practice.
Patanjali does not fully elucidate the nature of prana, and the theory and practice of pranayama seem to have undergone significant development after him.
He presents pranayama as essentially an exercise that is preliminary to concentration.
Yoga teachers including B. K. S. Iyengar have advised that pranayama should be part of an overall practice that includes the other limbs of Patanjali's Raja Yoga teachings, especially Yama, Niyama, and Asana.
Hatha yoga.
The Indian tradition of Hatha Yoga makes use of various pranayama techniques.
The 15th century "Hatha Yoga Pradipika" is a key text of this tradition and includes various forms of pranayama such as Kumbhaka breath retention and various body locks (Bandhas).
Other forms of pranayama breathing include Ujjayi breath ("Victorious Breath"), Sitali (breathing through the rolled tongue), Bhastrika ("Bellows Breath"), Kapalabhati ("Skull-shining Breath", a Shatkarma purification), Surya Bhedana ("Sun-piercing Breath"), and the soothing Bhramari (buzzing like a bee).
B. K. S. Iyengar cautions that pranayama should only be undertaken when one has a firmly established yoga practice and then only under the guidance of an experienced Guru.
According to the scholar-practitioner of yoga Theos Bernard, the ultimate aim of pranayama is the suspension of breathing (kevala kumbhaka), "causing the mind to swoon".
Paramahansa Yogananda writes, "The real meaning of Pranayama, according to Patanjali, the founder of Yoga philosophy, is the gradual cessation of breathing, the discontinuance of inhalation and exhalation".
Yoga as exercise.
The yoga scholar Andrea Jain states that pranayama was "marginal to the most widely cited sources" before the 20th century, and that the breathing practices were "dramatically" unlike the modern ones; she writes that while pranayama in modern yoga as exercise consists of synchronising the breath with movements (between asanas), in texts like the "Bhagavad Gita" and the "Yoga Sutras of Patanjali", pranayama meant "complete cessation of breathing", for which she cites Bronkhorst 2007.
Buddhism.
According to the Pali Buddhist Canon, the Buddha prior to his enlightenment practiced a meditative technique which involved pressing the palate with the tongue and forcibly attempting to restrain the breath.
This is described as both extremely painful and not conducive to enlightenment.
In some Buddhist teachings or metaphors, breathing is said to stop with the fourth jhana, though this is a side-effect of the technique and does not come about as the result of purposeful effort.
The Buddha did incorporate moderate modulation of the length of breath as part of the preliminary tetrad in the Anapanasati Sutta.
Its use there is preparation for concentration.
According to commentarial literature, this is appropriate for beginners.
Indo-Tibetan tradition.
Later Indo-Tibetan developments in Buddhist pranayama which are similar to Hindu forms can be seen as early as the 11th century, in the Buddhist text titled the "Amṛtasiddhi", which teaches three bandhas in connection with yogic breathing (kumbakha).
Tibetan Buddhist breathing exercises such as the "nine breathings of purification" or the "Ninefold Expulsion of Stale Vital Energy" ("rlung ro dgu shrugs"), a form of alternate nostril breathing, commonly include visualizations.
In the Nyingma tradition of Dzogchen these practices are collected in the textual cycle known as "The Oral Transmission of Vairotsana" ("Vai ro snyan brgyud").
Effects.
Yoga has positive effects on blood pressure, heart rate variability, and baroreflex sensitivity.
In a systematic review of breathing exercises and blood pressure, a moderate but statistically significant beneficial effect was found.
A meta-analysis of "voluntary slow breathing", heart rate, and heart rate variability found that such breathing leads to an increase in the parasympathetic nervous control of the heart, and notes "By considering the importance of the parasympathetic nervous system for health-related issues, stimulating non-invasively the vagus nerve represents a valid target."
The Art of Communicating 
The Art of Communicating is a book written by Zen Master Thích Nhất Hạnh.
The nine-chapter book was published in 2013 by HarperCollins Publishers LLC.
According to Thích Nhất Hạnh, despite the integral role of technology, video conferencing, messaging and telephones in our lives, we still have difficulty communicating and understanding our inner sufferings.
In this book, Thích Nhất Hạnh teaches how to communicate confidently and mindfully, first with ourselves and then with those around us.
Plot.
Essential Food.
In this chapter, the role of food in human life is discussed, emphasizing that it is not limited to eating and drinking, and that what we see, hear, touch and smell is also human food.
Therefore, we must pay attention to the fact that the types of food we consume contain compassion and kindness.
Thích Nhất Hạnh wrote:When we say something that nourishes us and uplifts the people around us, we are feeding love and compassion.
When we speak and act in a way that causes tension and anger, we are nourishing violence and suffering.
Communicating with Yourself.
In this chapter, the Buddhist master explains the importance of mindful communication we create with ourselves.
According to Thích Nhất Hạnh  in the world of modern technology, even if we are always online, texting and holding video conferences, a person feels lonely.
When we realize that we are walking, sitting, or doing something mindfully, we begin to communicate with ourselves, and at the same time, we can create compassionate communication with other people by removing fear and anger from our souls.We always have time for at least one in-breath and out-breath before we pick up the phone or before we press send on text or e-mail.
If we do this, there  is a much greater chance that we will be putting more compassionate communication out into the world.
The Keys to Communicating with Others.
In the third chapter, the author writes that we can establish compassionate communication with other people when we are aware of our own breathing.
At this time, we can see that there is a Buddha inside all other people and we can listen to them with deep desire.
According to the author, when people are able to listen to each other deeply, they suffer less and understand each other.
"The foundation of love is understanding, and that means first if all understanding suffering.
Each of us is hungry for understanding.
If you really want to love someone and make him or her happy, you have to understand that person is suffering".
The Six Mantras of Loving Speech.
In this chapter of the book, Thích Nhất Hạnh writes that feeling alone is just a perception and offers six mantras for compassionate communication, which is the key to loving speech and deep listening.
They include "I am here for you", "I know you are there and I am happy", "I know you suffer, that is why I am here for you", "I suffer please help", "this is a happy moment" and "you are partly right".
When Difficulties Arise.
In this part, the importance of breathing consciously and understanding the cause of anger in order to manage anger when difficulties arise is emphasized.
According to him, suppressing anger can be dangerous.
It will explode if it is ignored.
Mindful Communication at Work.
In order to live a life of awareness and less stress in the workplace, Thích Nhất Hạnh emphasizes in this chapter the importance of creating a place where one can breathe for a few minutes.
He writes that the phone call is also a call for people to be aware of what they are doing and to focus on their breath: "When you walk mindfully, enjoying every step you take, this encourages others to do the same, even if they don't know that you are practicing mindfulness."
Creating Community in the World.
Advising the practice of awareness to create a conscious society, the author notes that in order to change the world, it is necessary to start with society.
Systematic change is possible with collective energy: "See yourself in the community and the community in you.
This is a process of transforming your way of seeing, and it will transform how, and how effectively, you communicate".
Our Communication Is Our Continuation.
Thích Nhất Hạnh writes in Chapter 8 that our communication is what we give to the world and what we leave behind.
We communicate when we speak, think and act.
So communication is karma, and every communication bears our signature.
Practices for Compassionate Communication.
In the last chapter, the author speaks about mindful breathing, noting that when working with a computer, we should remind ourselves to take a break at certain hours and breathe in and out.
While drinking tea, we should enjoy it and listen to the child inside us: "When we are embracing the wounded child inside us, we are embracing all the wounded children of the past generations".
Soul flight 
Originally, soul flight is a technique of ecstasy used by shamans with the purpose of entering into a state of trance.
During the ecstatic trance it is believed that the shaman's soul has left the body and corporeal world, not unlike an out-of-body experience, which allows him or her to enter into a spiritual world and interact with its beings.
As if going into another realm, shamans either descend into an underworld (cf. katabasis or nekyia) or ascend unto an upper world (cf. ) and they are in sense flying through these other places.
By entering into the trance-like state, shamans profess to provide services for their tribesmen and one of the techniques they apply for this purpose is soul flight.
They alter their consciousness to connect with the spirit world, which is considered to be the source of their knowledge and power.
Among the many tasks that practitioners believe could be accomplished through soul flight are: healing, divination, protection, clairvoyance, dream interpretation, mediation between the divine and the humane, communicating with spirits of the dead (séance), and escorting deceased souls to the afterlife (psychopomp).
Soul flight, also known as shamanic journeying or magical flight, has been exercised from paleolithic times to the present day.
As time went by, this shamanic practice evolved into a way for the individual to transcend themselves.
Theoretical background.
In 1951, Mircea Eliade's historical study of different manifestations of shamanism across the globe, titled , was published in France.
He pointed out that shamanism wasn't just practiced in Siberia and Eurasia, but could be found in cultures all across the world.
According to Eliade, the core principle of shamanism is the application of "techniques of ecstasy" which enable people to interact with the spiritual world on behalf of the community.
There are three ways of becoming a shaman: by spontaneous vocation (i.e. the "call" of "election), by hereditary transmission, or by personal quest.
A shaman is only recognized after he received two kinds of teaching: ecstatic (e.g. dreams, trances, visions) and traditional (e.g. shamanic techniques, names, and functions of the spirits, mythology, and genealogy of the clan, secret language).
The former teaching is conveyed by the spirits while the latter lesson is given by the elder shamans.
Together, both teachings constitute initiation.
Selection for the role of a shaman may be derived from a crisis, an illness, or an episode of insanity; all of which are interpreted as experiencing personal death.
This initiation crisis usually involves an experience of suffering which is followed by death and dismemberment (i.e. descent into the underworld), an ascend unto the upper world and interactions with other souls and spirits along these both ways (cf. dying-and-rising deity).
The cross-culturally recurrent mytheme of death-dismemberment-rebirth reflect the death of one identity and the birth of another one.
Overcoming these experiences leads the shaman towards a new level of identity, and this transforming experience is symbolized as the flight of his or her soul.
A shaman's soul-flying abilities presuppose a sacred cosmology, or a world-view that encompasses a sacred or ultimate reality that is structured in what has been called an archetypically, three-storied cosmology.
It entails the earth in the middle or the everyday world of non-ordinary reality.
The upper world is supposed to be the abode of benevolent spirits and heavenly scenes, while the underworld consists of ancestral and malignant spirits as well as dark and gloomy places.
Historical overview.
The Stone Age.
Prior to the first agricultural revolution, when people still lived in hunter-gatherer societies, shamanism possibly emerged from a belief in the afterlife.
Shamanism was practiced among nearly all documented hunter-gatherers, and it has often been proposed by anthropologists to be the world's oldest profession.
By visibly transforming during initiation and trance, the shaman attempts to convince tribal members that he or she can interact with invisible forces that control uncertain outcomes.
By doing so, the shaman acts like he or she can influence unpredictable, important events.
The transformative display of the shaman during trance is thought to be essential because it serves as evidence of spiritual communication for those who behold his or her ritual, which then contributes to the credibility of the shaman.
The Bronze Age.
After gradually switching towards an agrarian society, humans settled down and civilization emerged.
During the Bronze Age, it is thought that people experienced themselves in what has been called a "continuous cosmos", wherein a sense of deep connectedness existed between the natural plus socio-cultural world and the worlds of the Gods (above and below).
In such a world, time moves in cycles that repeat itself throughout eternity.
In a continuous cosmos, people defined themselves in terms of fitting into and being in harmony with, these cycles.
Back then, wisdom is thought to be power-oriented: to become a wise Bronze Age man or woman meant to learn how to acquire and hold on to power.
For example, the Pharaoh was thought of as godlike, and this wasn't a metaphor for the Ancient Egyptians.
The difference between human beings and the Gods was essentially differences in power.
The Ancient Egyptians believed that an individual was made up of many parts, some physical and others spiritual.
Their concept of the soul postulated several components, one of which – the "Ba -" corresponds with what in Western thought is called the soul, although the two concepts aren't easily commensurable.
In the Egyptian Book of the Dead, the "Ba" is depicted as a bird with the head of a human, symbolizing both its human nature and its mobility.
It was believed that the "Ba" lived on after the body had died, and flew out of the tomb of his or her owner to join with the "Ka" ("life force", cf. élan vital) in the afterlife, and it was conceivable that the "Ba" could also be released during sleep.
Later, Coptic texts adopted the Greek word "Psyche" instead of the native "Bai" as the term for soul, which demonstrates a link between the earlier concept of the "Ba" and the Christian interpretation of the soul.
Classical Antiquity.
The worldview of a continuous cosmos is shattered during the Axial Age, although it doesn't vanish completely.
Charles Taylor dubbed this transition "the Great Disembedding": the world as a continuous cosmos, in a mythological sense, was broadly replaced by a different worldview on understanding the relationship between the self and the world.
This new worldview uses the mythology of two worlds, namely "the everyday world" and "the real world".
"The everyday world" is populated with untrained minds and riddled with self-deception, violence, and chaos.
In contrast, in "the real world" you are in touch with reality, wherein wise minds can see the world without illusion and delusion.
During the Axial Age, the practice of soul flight was exapted by ancient philosophers, meaning that it came to be used as a means of transcending the self from the everyday world towards the real world.
Meaning isn't based on the connectedness with the eternal cycles anymore; its focus has shifted towards a connectedness with the real world.
As such, there was a radical change in how people defined themselves and the world around them, as people increasingly defined themselves by how they can self-transcend, or how they can grow as an individual.
Wisdom changed from being solely focused on power towards a focus on this quest for self-transcendence.
Orphism.
Orpheus, the legendary musician and prophet from Greek mythology, was believed to have descended into Hades to recover his lost wife Eurydice.
Alas to no avail, but, allegedly, he lived to tell his tale as he did return to back the earthly world.
Orpheus was seen as the founder and prophet of the Orphic Mysteries, possibly the successor of the more ancient Dionysian Mysteries.
According to the Orphics, the soul is godlike in its essential nature but, due to some primordial sin, it descended to earth where it lives in a succession of bodies, human or otherwise.
The soul of man is divine and immortal and it seeks to return to its essential nature, but the body holds it in its captivity.
At the moment of bodily death, the soul is liberated for a short time before it is again taken captive in a different body.
As such, the soul journeys between the natural world and the spiritual world from one generation to the next (cf. reincarnation).
To escape this so-called "circle of necessity", or "wheel of birth", an act of divine grace is required.
The more virtuous one lives her or his life, the higher will be their next reincarnation until the soul ascends as high as from which it came (cf. Metempsychosis).
Pythagoreanism.
The Pythagoreans adopted many of the Orphic teachings into their own philosophical tradition, in which great emphasis was also laid on the purification of the soul.
According to Proclus, Pythagoras learned Orphic beliefs and practices when he completed initiation in Thrace.
Pythagoras is considered by some scholars to be a reformer of Orphism, just as Orpheus was a reformer of the Dionysian Mysteries.
As such, he was in part responsible for introducing the mystical element into Ancient Greek philosophy.
It is plausible that Pythagoras was initiated into shamanic training through something which was called the "Thunderstone ceremony", which involved isolating oneself in a cave and going through some sort of radical transformation before coming back out of it.
Pythagoras also seems to have experienced soul flight, when he spoke about the ability of the psyche to be liberated from the body.
By using music and mathematics, he realized there are abstract patterns that lie beyond our direct awareness, but that we can get access to nonetheless.
Self-transcendence, in this case, means getting in touch with these rationally realized patterns.
Although we are trapped inside the everyday world we can, in a mythological sense, learn to fly above this world and see the real world.
Here, myths refer to symbolic stories about those patterns that have always been with us.
Plotinus.
In Plotinus' treatise on the nature of beauty, the beauty of the soul consists in the emancipation from the passions.
The neoplatonic philosopher argued that those who have the strength should turn away from material beauty, forego all that is known by the eyes, and search for their soul's beauty within themselves.
We should aspire to behold the vision of our inner beauty, so our soul can first become virtuous and beautiful and, eventually, divine.
Plotinus further asked in what manner, or by what device, one may achieve such an inner vision.
Referring to a passage from Homer's Odyssey ("Let us flee, then, to our beloved homeland"), Plotinus inquires into the manner of this flight: 
"This is not a journey for the feet; the feet bring us only from land to land; nor need you think of coach or ship to carry you away; all this order of things you must set aside and refuse to see: you must close the eyes and call instead upon another vision which is to be waked within you, a vision, the birthright of all, which few turn to use".
The Middle Ages.
With its establishment as the dominant religion in Europe, Christianity and its doctrines became of the utmost importance in the Middle Ages.
A passage in the eighth book of the Confessions, Saint Augustine discusses the flight of the soul in a way that resembles Plotinus' treatise.
Both concur that one must dispense with ordinary modes of perception to experience soul flight.
St.
Augustine interprets the soul's flight as one's way of reaching wisdom which is the way directed towards the light; we have to flee from sensible things and have need of wings to fly towards that light, out of the darkness in which we live.
But where the problem for Plotinus is one of seeing, St. Augustine emphasizes the importance of the will, and he replaces feeling good or beautiful with willing it.
His conceptualization of soul flight became, especially in his later works, thus more concerned with one's willingness to make the journey towards Heaven.
The opposite direction is taken in the Apocalypse of Peter, which describes Christ's three days' descent into Hell.
Another example of this kind of Christian katabasis is the Harrowing of Hell, which also chronicles the period between Jesus' Crucifixion and his Resurrection.
These are one of the earliest examples of explicit depictions of heaven and hell, a theme that would inspire many more writers and artists in days to come.
The Imitation of Christ, which is the practice of following the example of Jesus, is considered to be the fundamental purpose of Christian life by St. Augustine.
In the words of St. Francis, poverty is the key element of following the example of Jesus and he believed in the physical as well as the spiritual imitation of Christ.
His physical imitation was achieved when St. Francis received stigmata in 1224 A.D., during the apparition of a Seraph in a state of religious ecstasy.
In the early 15th century, Thomas à Kempis wrote the Imitation of Christ, which provides specific instructions for imitating Christ.
His devotional approach is characterized by its emphasis on the interior life as well as the withdrawal from this world, thus it is most concerned with the spiritual imitation of Christ.
Dante.
Dante's Divine Comedy, one of the most celebrated works in Western literature, narrates the journey of the soul after death.
It chronicles Dante's own descent into Hell, his wanderings in Purgatory, and finally, his soul's ascent to Heaven.
In accordance with the medieval world-view of 14th century Europe, the poet envisions a rich afterlife where he, accompanied by one of three guides, visits many mysterious places and encounters numerous souls, spirits, and shadows.
In an allegorical sense, the poem represents the soul's flight from Lucifer in Hell towards God in Heaven.
With regard to the Commedia, Carl Jung argued: 
"The compelling power and deeper meaning of the work do[es] not lie in the historical and mythical material, but in the visionary experience it serves to express".
Meister Eckhart.
Around the same time when Dante was compiling his Commedia, Meister Eckhart commented the following on where one must look to find spiritual salvation: 
"[To] grasp all things in a divine way and make of them something more than they are in themselves.
(...)
This cannot be learned by taking flight, that is by fleeing from things and physically withdrawing to a place of solitude, but rather we must learn to maintain inner solitude regardless of where we are or who we are with.
We must learn to break through things and to grasp God in them, allowing him to take form in us powerfully and essentially".
According to Meister Eckhardt the way toward the soul lies inwards, as he writes: 
"Therefore do I turn back once more to myself, there do I find the deepest places, deeper than Hell itself; for even from there does my wretchedness drive me.
Nowhere can I escape myself!
Here I will set me down and here I will remain".
The Modern Age.
During the Renaissance, Europeans refocused their attention on the ideas and achievements of classical antiquity, which became particularly manifested in art, architecture, politics, science, and literature.
The invention of the printing press instigated a new age of mass communication, with the result that the flow of ideas between people reached unprecedented levels of speed and range.
This permanently altered the structure of society exemplified, among other things, by a sharp increase in literacy and the emergence of the middle class.
Certain authors began to use writing as a means to express their visionary experiences, a practice which became more widespread from the Middle Ages onwards.
Milton.
In 17th century Britain, during a time of religious and political turmoil, John Milton wrote Paradise Lost.
The epic poem, written in blank verse, starts in medias res with Satan's rebellion against God, seen through the eyes of Satan himself.
It continues with Satan's fall from Heaven, the arrival of the serpent in Eden, and eventually, the story of Adam and Eve.
The overall theme of Milton's masterpiece addresses the battle between God and Satan, fought across three worlds (i.e. Heaven, Earth, and Hell), for control over the human soul.
Swedenborg.
In the 1740s, Emanuel Swedenborg began to experience strange dreams and visions which he documented in his travelogue.
These experiences culminated in a spiritual awakening, in which he received a revelation from Jesus.
Because God had opened his spiritual eyes, Swedenborg felt he could visit heaven and hell to communicate with angels, demons, and other spirits.
In arguably his most famous work, Heaven and Hell, he gives a detailed description of the afterlife and explains how souls live on after the physical death of one's body.
According to Swedenborg, instead of one hell that is similar for everybody, there are an infinite variety and diversity of Heavens and Hells.
His writings gave rise to a new religious movement known as the New Church, which promoted one universal church based on love and charity.
Blake.
Between 1790 and 1793, while the Revolution was gaining momentum in France, William Blake composed a book in a similar literary tradition about the visionary's practice of soul flight.
Like Dante in his Commedia and Milton in his Paradise lost, the poet visits Hell and Heaven where he meets and speaks with angels and demons.
The book was written in prose, except for the introductory "Argument" and the "Song of Liberty", and accompanied by paintings of his own dreams and visions.
With satirical reference to Swedenborg's Heaven and Hell, he titled this book the Marriage of Heaven and Hell.
Although Blake was greatly influenced by Swedenborg's mystical conception of a sacred cosmology, he was opposed to Swedenborg's dualistic interpretation of good and evil.
As such, he deliberately presented a more unified vision of the cosmos wherein the upper world and the underworld are both parts of the same divine order; i.e. the marriage of Heaven and Hell.
Carl Jung.
From 1913 until 1930, Carl Jung carried out a self-experiment that became known as his confrontation with the unconscious.
He first recorded his inner experiences (dreams, visions, fantasies) in the Black Books, which are basically the records of this self-experiment.
These records were revised by Jung, and reflections were added.
He then copied these revisions and reflections in a calligraphic script and, accompanied by his own paintings (not unlike Blake in his prophetic books), put it together into a book bound in red leather entitled "Liber Novus" ("New Book")"."
The Red Book, as it is popularly known, was published in October 2009 and it chronicles Jung's struggle to regain his soul and overcome the contemporary malaise of spiritual alienation.
Within the same context of the visionary tradition in Western literature of some of the aforementioned authors, Jung argued that before you can find the way toward spiritual fulfillment you first must descend into your own Hell.
In the Red book, Jung comments the following on Jesus' descent into Hell: 
"No one knows what happened during the three days Christ was in Hell.
I have experienced it.
The men of yore said he had preached to the deceased.
What they say is true, but do you know how this happened?
It was folly and monkey business, an atrocious Hell's masquerade of the holiest mysteries.
How else could Christ have saved his Antichrist?
Read the unknown books of the ancients, and you will learn much from them.
Notice that Christ did not remain in Hell, but rose to the heights in the beyond".
On the dynamic relationship between Heaven and Hell, Jung concludes: 
"But the deepest Hell is when you realize that Hell is also no Hell, but a cheerful Heaven, not a Heaven in itself, but in this respect a Heaven, and in that respect a Hell" 
Shengtai 
(, "sacred embryo" or "embryo of sagehood") is a Chinese syncretic metaphor for achieving Buddhist liberation or Daoist transcendence.
The circa fifth century CE Chinese Buddhist "Humane King Sutra" first recorded ("sagely womb") describing the bodhisattva path towards attaining Buddhahood; was related with the more familiar Indian Mahayana concept of ("embryo/womb of the Buddha", Chinese () that all sentient beings are born with the Buddha-nature potential to become enlightened.
The Chan Buddhist teaching master Mazu Daoyi (709-788) first mentioned post-enlightenment (, "nurturing the sacred embryo"), and by the tenth century Chan monks were regularly described as recluses nurturing their sacred embryo in isolated locations.
The renowned Daoist Zhang Boduan (984-1082) was first to use the expression ("sagely embryo") in a context of physiological Internal Alchemy, and adepts developed prolonged meditation techniques through which one can supposedly become pregnant, gestate, and give birth to a spiritually perfected doppelganger.
Terminology.
Chinese () is a linguistic compound of two common words: 
The second meaning can refer to Buddha or Buddhism, for instance, (, "become an ").
Chinese () can ambiguously be translated as English embryo, fetus, or womb.
The Chinese lexicon differentiates this semantic field with (, "womb; placenta"), (, "embryo"), (, "embryo; beginning of things"), (, "fetus; embryo"), and (, literally "child palace", "uterus; womb").
The unabridged ("Comprehensive Chinese Word Dictionary"), which is lexicographically to the "Oxford English Dictionary", defines with two meanings: 
There is no standard English translation for Chinese and scholars have rendered it as: 
"Autogestation" is Christine Mollier's unique translation, "the generation of an embryo of immortality, the germ of a perfect being, develops within the practitioner’s body through a process of 'autogestation' that can be labelled as an internal sexual alchemy" (2016: 87).
In Daoist terminology, Sacred Embryo has several synonyms, including (, Mysterious Pearl), (, Spiritual Pearl), (, Infant), (, Red Child), and (, Embryo of the Dao) (Darga 2008: 883).
Indian Buddhism.
The Chinese Buddhist word (, "sacred embryo") was associated with the better-known Indian Mahayana Buddhist concept of ("embryo/womb of the [i.e., Buddha]") referring to the inherent potential of any sentient being to become a buddha.
is a Pali word (meaning "one who has thus come/gone") that Gautama Buddha uses when referring to himself or other Buddhas in the Pāli Canon, and translated as Chinese (, "thus come"). is a Sanskrit word (meaning "womb; fetus; embryo; child; interior; inside"), sharing the ambiguity of Chinese (, "womb; fetus; embryo").
Buddhist scholars translated into the "awkward Chinese phrase" (, literally "storehouse of the thus-come one") with (, "storehouse, depository, treasury; bury; internal organs, viscera"), thus, the sexual and gestational connotations of the Indian Buddhist "doctrine of the embryo of the thus-come one were lost in translation" (Buckelew 2018: 378).
Many Indian Buddhist scriptures portrayed the female body, especially the womb, as impure, and characterized fetal gestation as the "focal point of human suffering", representing the cosmic misery of ("cyclical birth and death").
In response, Buddhists also developed elaborate legends about the Buddha Śākyamuni's supernatural birth.
His mother Queen Māyā supposedly was impregnated while dreaming that a white elephant entered her body, her pregnancy was painless, and the Buddha was born from underneath her right arm.
These narrative elements helped establish the Buddha not only as different from ordinary people but more specifically as "impervious to the pollution and suffering understood to ordinarily accompany sexual intercourse, fetal gestation, and birth" (Buckelew 2018: 376).
The metaphysical terms of ("embryo/matrix of the thus-come one") and Chinese ("sacred embryo") were closely related to the concept of Buddha-nature, Sanskrit or Chinese , the latent potential to achieve Buddhahood that lies dormant in all sentient beings (Despeux 2016: 151).
Medieval Chinese Buddhism.
The (, "Humane King Sutra"), an apocryphal scripture composed around the fifth century during the Northern Wei dynasty (386–534), first used the expression (, "sagely embryo") describing the bodhisattva path towards attaining Buddhahood: "Buddhas and bodhisattvas cultivate and nourish the ten types of consciousness [ ] into a sagely embryo."
(tr. Despeux 2016: 151).
While Indian Buddhist texts described the bodhisattva path as consisting of ten sequential stages or "grounds" (Sanskrit , Chinese ), the Chinese expanded this sequence to include thirty additional preliminary stages or "minds" ( ), resulting in a much longer path towards enlightenment.
These thirty minds that precede entry into the ten grounds, "constitute an intermediate sequence of stages during which the aspirant's sagehood is already 'conceived' but nevertheless still 'embryonic'".
According to the "Humane King Sutra",  
"In these [first ten minds], the bodhisattva is capable of transforming sentient beings in small measure and has already surpassed all of the good stages of the [lesser] two vehicles.
All buddhas and bodhisattvas [in the course of their development] nurture these ten minds, which constitute an embryo of sagehood."
(tr. Buckelew 2018: 378).
Instead of the transitional encompassing only the first ten minds, a subsequent passage more broadly associates it with all thirty,  
"[As for] the embryo of sagehood's thirty stages of patiently subduing [passions], [Namely] the ten faiths, ten cessations, and ten firm minds, Among all buddhas of the three times [past, present, and future] who have practiced within [them], There are none who were not born from this patient subjugation [of passions]."
(tr. Buckelew 2018: 378).
These two quotes show that the Chinese concept of ("embryo of sagehood") is entirely different from the Indian Buddhist concept of or Chinese ("embryo of the thus-come one"), which is equivalent to ("buddha-nature").
While buddha-nature refers to the universal buddhahood inherent in all sentient beings, the discusses as specifically referring to an exceptional aspirant's progress on sagely fetal growth along the bodhisattva path.
The Chinese term never seems to have been used to translate the Sanskrit word despite their apparent similarities.
In Chinese Buddhism, "sage" (Sanskrit , Chinese ) and "thus-come one" (, ) are standard epithets for buddhas; and both Sanskrit and Chinese can ambiguously mean either "womb" or "embryo".
The most comprehensive Chinese-language collection of the Buddha's biographies, the sixth-century (), uses the term referring to the embryonic Buddha Śākyamuni within Queen Māyā's womb, which suggests that some Chinese Buddhists may have connected the embryo of sagehood to the Buddha's miraculous fetal gestation (Buckelew 2018: 380).
and were not used interchangeably in China, and there was a verbal contrast in their usages.
On the one hand, a "soteriology of sudden liberative vision" was associated with the words "embryo of the thus-come one" or "buddha-nature", typically used with the Chinese verbs (, "to view; look at; watch") or (, "to see; to appear").
For example, the popular Chinese Buddhist saying that (見性成佛, "seeing one's [buddha-]nature and becoming a buddha").
With the understanding that (, "becoming") a buddha is instantaneous, it is categorically all or nothing (Buckelew 2018: 381).
On the other, a "soteriology of gradual development" was associated with the "embryo (or womb) of sagehood".
Medieval Chinese Buddhist texts did not mention "seeing" the , but rather used the verbs (, "to enter"), (/, "to conceive"), (, "to be born from"), and most commonly or ( or , "to nurture").
"Nurturing the embryo of sagehood" derives from the ancient prenatal concept of (, "nurturing the embryo").
These verbs illustrate that "the embryo of sagehood" retained closer semantic connections to literal embryology than did the "embryo of the thus-come one", which was understood in China as equivalent to buddha-nature.
(Buckelew 2018: 381) 
Vasubandhu's (Shiqin , fl. 300-400) ( ; Treatise on the Ten Stages Sutra) describes the Ten Stages of the original Indian Buddhist path of the bodhisattva as being "like pregnancy in a womb" ().
The Chinese Buddhist scholar-monk Fashang (, 495–580) explains,  
"[The phrase] "like pregnancy in a womb" takes women as an example and takes pregnancy as a metaphor.
In the first month, [a pregnant woman] carries the embryo, and after ten [lunar] months, [the embryo] is completely developed.
Bodhisattvas are also like this: in the first ground, they attain the embryo of sagehood [], and in the tenth ground, the body of sagehood [] is completely developed."
(tr. Buckelew 2018: 383)  
Instead of following the sequence of thirty minds preceding entry into the ten grounds/stages, Fashang connects the embryo of sagehood to the earlier Indian Buddhist understanding of the unfolding bodhisattva path as consisting only of the ten grounds themselves, with each progressive month of pregnancy corresponding to one ground.
The 594 (, Great [Manual of] Calming and Contemplation) Buddhist doctrinal summa, based on lectures given by Zhiyi (538–597), the fourth patriarch of Tiantai Buddhism, discusses ("embryo / womb of sagehood") meditation in terms of the (, "three kinds of dharma": precepts, concentration, and wisdom).
Practitioners who skillfully regulate these three matters cause [themselves] to be conceived within the womb of sagehood.
Because the activity of their minds is not yet fully under their command, they ought to apply their minds to bringing together the father and mother of skillful means and the perfection of wisdom [respectively], who will conceive [them] within the womb of sagehood.
Why would [such practitioners] allow themselves to be conceived within the wombs of denizens of hell, the three [unfortunate] destinies, or the realms of humans or gods? (tr. Buckelew 2018: 385-386)  
Zhiyi interprets not just as an analogy for gradually growing enlightenment but as a literal site for rebirth, that should be considered highly preferable to rebirth in the destinies of samsara.
Zhiyi also uses to explain (, "nonbirth-birth") that the describes as "peacefully abiding in worldly truth, when someone first emerges from the womb, this is called 'nonbirth-birth'."
Now to explain "worldly truth."
[This term refers to] when ignorance combines with dharma nature and all kinds of [mistaken] separations and distinctions are produced [in the mind]; thus it is called "worldly truth."
As for "peacefully abiding," if by means of calming and contemplation [that is, meditation], one abides peacefully in worldly truth, then it [worldly truth] becomes an inconceivable object, and the stage of practicing observation is completed; thus it is called "peacefully abiding."
Because one peacefully abides, [this stage of practice] is called "being conceived within the womb of sagehood."
When one first activates one's buddha knowledge and [buddha] vision and recognizes that [all things] are unborn ( ), this stage is called "exiting [or, being born from] the womb of sagehood."
Because [at this stage] one does not see worldly truth [through the lens of] ignorance, [the sutra] says "not born."
Because one obtains buddha knowledge and buddha vision, [the sutra] says "born."
The [Great Wisdom] Treatise ( ) says: "all are not born, but is born," which is the [same] meaning [as the sutra's nonbirth-birth]. (tr. Buckelew 2018: 387)  
Zhiyi's disciple Guanding (, 561–632) explains that "Peacefully abiding in worldly truth" has two meanings.
Exoterically, it denotes the time from first thinking of conception in a womb until death.
Esoterically, it means a bodhisattva who is at the stage of cultivating skillful means, which reiterates Zhiyi's notion of worldly truth as a womb within which the practitioner grows as a bodhisattva.
"When cultivation gives rise to realization and ignorance is destroyed, this [moment] constitutes the first emergence from the womb; it is also nirvana, which is beginningless and yet is said thenceforth to begin. (tr. Buckelew 2018: 388) 
Chan Buddhism.
With the rise of Chan Buddhism from the Tang through Song dynasties, Buddhist religious authority began to shift from translated and apocryphal Buddhist scriptures to the recorded sayings of indigenous Chinese Chan masters, and Chan tradition emphasized sudden over gradual enlightenment, namely, (, "seeing one's [buddha-]nature and [instantly] becoming a buddha") (Buckelew 2018: 392).
The earliest recorded Chan usage of is in Mazu Daoyi's (709–788) famous sermon about (, "this very mind is Buddha").
The 952 (, Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall) version mentions (, "Nurturing the Sacred Embryo"): 
What the heart/mind produces is called form.
When one realizes that form is empty, production becomes nonproduction.
Having understood this, one can act according to circumstances, dressing, eating, developing and maintaining the sagely embryo (), and living in harmony with spontaneity. (tr. Despeux 2016: 152))  
The Tang scholar-monk Guifeng Zongmi (780-841), fifth patriarch of the Heze school in Southern Chan Buddhism, criticizes the apparent contradiction between Mazu's using the sacred embryo trope while claiming that enlightenment is instantaneous and need not be developed, Zongmi asks, "[Buddha-]nature is like empty space, neither growing nor diminishing.
By what means could it be supplemented?"
(tr. Buckelew 2018: 394).
Zongmi also mentions "feeding the soul and making the sagely embryo grow []" in his (, Preface to a Collection of Texts on the Origins of Chan") (Despeux 2016: 152).
Gufeng Zongmi notes the figurative resemblance between the embryo of sagehood and the impregnation of the storehouse consciousness—the eighth of the Eight Consciousnesses in the Yogācāra philosophical tradition, which is said to store the impressions () of previous experiences, which form the seeds () of future karma in this life and in subsequent rebirths.
His later commentary on the "Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment" ( ) says, the "awakened mind is the embryo of sagehood".
When by means of but a single thought one awakens to this perfect and wondrous mind, the storehouse consciousness () is thereupon impregnated with the seed of sagehood [], though conditions have not yet brought it to external manifestation; thus, it is like the beginning of pregnancy. (tr. Buckelew 2018: 390-391)  
Although Zhiyi (above) argued that the embryo of sagehood could be conceived through nothing more than proper meditation, Zongmi equated the embryo of sagehood with the awakened mind, metaphysically explained as the seeds of Buddhahood impregnating one's storehouse consciousness in order attain liberation (Buckelew 2018: 392).
By the tenth century, it became increasingly common for Chan monks to be described as recluses nurturing the embryo of sagehood in isolated forests or on mountains.
For example, the poet-monk Qiji (860–940) describes "sitting on stones, gazing at clouds, and nurturing the embryo of sagehood."
Elsewhere, he recounts a trip to the stone bridge deep in the Tiantai Mountain mountains in search of the legendary Eighteen Arhats, who he imagines "sitting together on green cliffs, nurturing the embryo of sagehood."
(Buckelew 2018: 396).
According to the 988 (, Song-dynasty Biographies of Eminent Monks), when the wandering monk Zhifeng () met Yuquan Shenxiu (605–706), "… the ice of his doubts melted away" and he decided to "nurture the embryo of sagehood []."
He moved to the Anfeng mountains (present-day Shanxi), where he passed ten years, "eating from trees and drinking from streams."
After the provincial governor Wei Wen learned of Zhifeng, he invited him to return to the city, where he took up abbacy of the new Anguo Monastery.
"From that time on, he rushed about [performing public duties] in the padded robes [of a city monk]."
(tr. Buckelew 2018: 398).
Subsequently, it became a literary trope that after a Chan monk's enlightenment was certified through lineage transmission, they would nurture the embryo of sagehood during a period of reclusion or aimless wandering before returning to public life (Buckelew 2018: 397).
After the early Chinese Buddhist reception of the "embryo of sagehood" was guided by the metaphysics of spiritual pregnancy and buddha bodies, Chan Buddhists gave the concept a more markedly metaphorical character, and Daoist Inner Alchemy, which emerged closely after the rise of Chan, gave a new role of embodiment in the pursuit of religious liberation (Buckelew 2018: 401).
Daoist Internal Alchemy.
During the Tang dynasty (618-907), the Daoist practice of psychophysiological (Internal/Inner Alchemy/Elixir) began to supersede the ancient, and sometimes dangerous, practice of chemical (External/Outer Alchemy/Elixir).
Daoist Internal Alchemy practitioners developed the term "sacred embryo" into a complex process of symbolic pregnancy generating a spiritually perfected duplicate of oneself within oneself, which later became synonymous with the elixir of immortality in External Alchemy.
This alchemical embryo "represents a new life, true and eternal in its quality" (Darga 2008: 883).
In Internal Alchemy, the "sagely embryo" is an amalgam of Buddhist ideas concerning latent spiritual qualities that are developable through a symbolic birth leading to awakening, and Daoist ideas of accessing immortality through (, "reversion") to the cosmic matrix. (, "return; reversion; inversion") is a basic concept in Daoist alchemical literature, for example, the term (, "Returning to the embryo") refers to mentally repeating one's embryonic development, emphasizing "the return of the physical freshness and perfect vital force of infancy, childhood, and even fetal life" (Needham and Lu 1983: 135).
Returning to the origin, the womb, or the embryo implies the idea of "rebirth and renewal as a kind of countercurrent to ordinary life" (Robinet 1993: 112).
In distinction to Buddhism emphasizing the spiritual or psychological dimensions of an adept's experience, Daoism focuses upon corporeal metaphors for the physical or psychophysiological sensations such as inner breathing, inner flows, and inner heat (Despeux 2016: 153).
Although the gestational motif appears in Internal Alchemy texts around the middle of the Tang, it derives from earlier Buddhist (mentioned above) and Daoist contexts.
Many Daoist classics mention embryonic and gestational motifs.
A famous example is the circa fourth century BCE praising infancy.
"He who embodies the fullness of integrity is like a ruddy infant [].
Wasps, spiders, scorpions, and snakes will not sting or bite him; Rapacious birds and fierce beasts will not seize him."
(55, tr. Mair 1990: 24).
"By being a ravine for all under heaven, Eternal integrity will never desert you [].
If eternal integrity never deserts you, You will return to the state of infancy []" (28, tr. Mair 1990: 93); which suggests that "human vitality is fully charged upon parturition and constantly discharges with every natural cycle of breath" (Yang 2015: 158).
Both these words meaning "infant", () and (), sometimes refer to the embryo in Internal Alchemy (Despeux 2016: 150).
The circa mid-second century CE (Token for the Agreement of the Three According to the "Book of Changes"), a fundamental treatise on Inner Alchemy, poetically describes the birth of a spiritual embryo, which is usually connected with its transcendence of the mortal body.
Similar in kind to a hen’s egg, the white [Yang] and the black [Yin] tally with one another.
It is only one inch in size, but it is the beginning [of the sagely embryo].
Then, the four limbs, the five viscera, the sinews and bones join it.
When the ten months have elapsed, it leaves its womb.
Its bones are weak and pliant, its flesh is smooth like lead. (tr. Despeux 2016: 148)  
Although Daoist texts describe body-centered meditations that recall the various stages of embryonic development, they are nevertheless describing psychological or spiritual processes.
The four stages in the allegorical development of the (, "sagely embryo") closely follow actual gestations: (, "formation of the embryo"); (, "nourishing the embryo") for a duration of ten lunar months, corresponding to the 280 days of gestation according to traditional Chinese medical texts; (, lit. "liberation from the womb", "delivery"); and (, "breastfeeding") for three years (Despeux 2016: 148).
Already in the second and third centuries, some Daoist writings referred to religious practices of (, "fostering the embryo") or of nurturing an infant god, called the (, "red child"), that resides inside the body.
The Shangqing School scriptures, believed to have been revealed to Yang Xi in the late fourth-century, developed these practices into formalized and complex meditative procedures for visualizing one's own spiritual rebirth (Buckelew 2018: 402).
The fourth or fifth century (, Commentary to the Scripture on the Inner Effulgences of the Yellow Court) has one of the earliest references to an allegorical embryo, "the embryo-immortal [] dances to the three couplets of the heart-lute."
(tr. Despeux 2016: 149).
The circa ninth-century (, Scripture of the Nine Transcendents and the Perfected Dragon and Tiger), which contains commentaries attributed to Ye Fashan (616–720) and Luo Gongyuan (, 618-758), instructs an adept to "imagine the true essence of the two kidneys merging into a single and the blood of the heart descending to combine [with it], whereupon the image of the infant is formed."
The Ye commentary explains that the embryo of an immortal body is formed by visualizing the same (, "semen") and (, "blood") substances whose combination in sexual intercourse was understood to cause normal pregnancy.
And the Luo-attributed commentary says that after creating the embryo of sagehood, one must fully refine the body of sagehood for ten months, after which it is capable of exiting the practitioner's physical body "from the crown of the head riding on a purple cloud and that it constitutes a second body identical in appearance to the material body."
(Buckelew 2018: 403-404).
In practices for transforming the body's energies, the formation of the embryo is closely related to the purification and merging of essence, energy, and spirit: , , and. Beyond this, texts of different eras define the embryo and explain its formation in various ways.
The embryo as the perfected elixir can denote the (, "true energy") or (, "original energy") which, according to Zhong-Lü sources, achieves fullness after three hundred days of transformation.
(Darga 2008: 884).
The late Tang (, Record of the Transmission of the Way from Zhong[li Quan] to Lü [Dongbin]) describes how "the medicinal ingredients of the inner elixir come from the heart and kidneys, which all people possess."
By combining them within oneself according to the proper timing and procedures, one "appropriates the efficacy of sexual intercourse between husband and wife, so that the embryo of sagehood is completed and true is born."
As a result, "when the great medicine is complete, the yang spirit emerges and there is a body outside the body, like a cicada shedding its skin."
This passage mixes alchemical and sexual themes.
Its basic sequence involves manipulating bodily substances originally found in the heart and kidneys toward the center of the body, where they fuse together; then refining the resultant Inner Alchemy or embryo of sagehood (the two concepts are used interchangeably); and finally giving birth from the crown of the head to an immortal body, the (, "yang spirit") ( (Buckelew 2018: 404-405).
In these meditation exercises, the (, "spirit") constitutes the adept's male component, that which becomes the Yang Spirit). is the feminine component, relating to spirit not as a wife to a husband but rather as mother to a son (Despeux 2016: 165).
Zhang Boduan (987-1082), one of the most famous Inner Alchemists of the Song period, was the first to use the expression ("sagely embryo") in the context of Internal Alchemy, and the first to have explicitly referred to a symbolic pregnancy process (Despeux 2016: 149).
Even though Zhang extensively studied Chan texts, his work was "a synthesis of Buddhist and Daoist methods in which the former are assimilated to the latter, so that the final package is essentially Daoist" (Capitanio 2015: 139).
Zhang's advocacy of (, "dual cultivation of nature and lifespan") implies the inadequacy of any Buddhist practice that focuses exclusively on witnessing buddha-nature.
Inner Alchemists regularly criticized Buddhists for focusing exclusively on (, "seeing their own [buddha] nature") while failing to cultivate (, "lifespan; longevity"), they fail to fabricate the spirit and, in the end, become nothing more than (, "yin ghosts").
This is illustrated in the legend of Zhang Boduan’s contest with a rival Buddhist master to see who could travel farther in an externalized spiritual body.
The monk's Yin Spirit could leave his body during meditative trances, and after travelling to a faraway land and returning, he described its beautiful flowers.
Not to be outdone, Zhang’s Yang Spirit travelled to the same place the monk described, plucked an actual flower and returned with it.
"In the great way of the Golden Elixir, life and nature are jointly cultivated.
Thus, by accumulation, the body is accomplished, and by dispersion, is accomplished.
In the place to which he travelled, Zhang’s perfected soul was manifested in a body.
This is what is called the ‘Yang Spirit.’" (Despeux 2016: 177).
Zhang Boduan's 1075 (Folios on Awakening to Perfection) defines the embryo as the energy of the One.
In this text, the embryo also represents the female within the male, i.e., the Yin of the human being that is enclosed and transformed by the Yang (Darga 2008: 884).
A commentary to this text, the (, Annotated Commentary on the Stanzas on the Awakening to Perfection, ambiguously mentions the ("infant"), although the majority of alchemical sources refer to the ("sagely embryo").
"When the three families [essence (), , and soul ()] meet, the infant coalesces; the Infant is the One, holding true .
[…]
After ten months, the embryo is complete; this is the foundation for entering sagehood."
(tr. Despeux 2016: 176-177).
The 1078 (, Master Chen's Formulas on the Internal Elixir) details how the sagely embryo transforms into the adept's physically and mentally identical doppelganger: 
When the numinous rotation [] occurs in the sagely embryo, the face of the immortal is produced.
The commentary says: "At the third revolution [of the Elixir], Yang is nourished and the visionary soul arises in the sagely embryo.
At the fourth revolution, Yin is nourished and the soul arises.
When the Elixir reaches this point, the and the are complete; the embryo's essence and spirit of the Five Peaks [its inner landscape] match with the appearance of one's inner body.
The egress of the spirit is [the emergence of] one's true self."
(tr. Despeux 2016: 167)  
The birth of the completed embryo, the perfect double, exits through the head in a process called the (, "egress of the spirit").
It contrasts with conventional delivery through the vagina, which alchemical texts refer to as the (, "orifice of life and death").
Chen Niwan (fl. twelfth century) describes egressing his spirit through the fontanel: "I have put into practice the work of old for a full year, and the six vessels have already stopped, the breath has returned to its root, and in the [lower] Cinnabar Field there is an infant ().
Its body and appearance are similar to mine."
Then comes the climax of the entire process: "As this infant grows, [there comes a point when it] cannot reside in this cavity [of the lower Cinnabar Field] any longer; so a fissure and then an orifice naturally appear, and it emerges through the top of the head.
This is known as 'exiting and leaving the sea of sufferings.'" (tr. Despeux 2016: 178) 
After various embryonic transformations, practitioners of Internal Alchemy are supposedly reborn as perfected, luminous replicas of themselves.
Men and women both refine their bodies into Pure Yang, eliminating all Yin to the extent that they no longer even have a shadow (or ).
That which they generate within themselves is not strictly the ethereal body of a transcendent because it is also visible to others (Despeux 2016: 177).
Subsequent Song (960-1279) and Yuan (1271–1368) inner alchemists, such as Xue Daoguang (1078?–1191) and Chen Zhixu (b. 1290), both praised Chan Buddhism but explicitly criticized the widespread notion that ("seeing one's own buddha-nature") alone is sufficient to turn one into a buddha (Buckelew 2018: 406).
texts of the Ming period (1368-1644) frequently compare the development of the embryo to the revelation of Buddhahood.
For instance, the 1615 (Principles of Balanced Cultivation of Inner Nature and Vital Force, the source of several illustrations above) uses (, "Body of the Law; ") as a synonym for .
The birth of the embryo represents the appearance of the (, "original spirit") or Buddhahood and is understood as enlightenment.
The process leading to the birth of the embryo consists of the purification of ("inner nature") and ("vital force").
Thus, the true inner nature and vital force come into being, which in turn is equated to the return to emptiness.
The embryo also indicates the unity of body (, "body"), (, "heart"), and (, "intention") in a state of quiescence without motion (Darga 2008: 884).
Lastly, the embryo is related to the Inner Alchemy practice of Taixi (embryonic breathing) (), which denotes breathing like a child in the womb.
Daoists have developed various methods of embryonic breathing but most of them share the fundamental idea that breath nourishes the body by circulating through its vital centers (Darga 2008: 884).
To "breathe like an embryo" refers to a manner of respiration that does not involve the nose or the mouth but rather the pores of the skin.
This expression may also denote the sensations experienced by adepts of something expanding and contracting, or "breathing" somewhere inside their bodies.
(Despeux 2016: 163).
The Chinese Buddhist concept of the "embryo of sagehood" originated in medieval China as a trope describing the complex bodhisattva path invented in the apocryphal "Humane King Sutra".
This doctrine was differentiated from the better known and linguistically similar Indian Buddhist ("embryo of the Buddha") concept that came to be equated with buddha-nature in China.
The embryo of sagehood implies the "need not only to see one's inherent buddha-nature but also to nurture a buddhahood that has to be conceived, gestated, and birthed."
In Chan Buddhism, nurturing the embryo of sagehood became a metaphor for a liminal period of idealized mountain and forest reclusion undertaken by enlightened masters who were still awaiting appointment to an abbacy.
Daoist inner alchemists combined early Shangqing School sacred embryology with contemporaneous Chinese Buddhist conceptions about the sacred embryo, resulting in a belief that a practitioner could conceive, gestate, and give birth to a supernatural body (Buckelew 2018: 409).
Conscious breathing 
Conscious breathing is an umbrella term for methods that direct awareness to the breath.
These methods may have the goal of improving breathing, or the primary goal can be to build mindfulness.
Human respiration is controlled consciously or unconsciously.
Applications.
Meditation.
Conscious breathing in meditation usually does not change the depth or rhythm of breathing, but uses breathing as an anchor for concentration and awareness.
Mindfulness and Awareness Trainings use conscious breathing for training awareness and body consciousness.
Vipassana Meditation focuses on breathing in and around the nose to calm the mind (anapanasati).
Psychology and psycho-therapy.
Many breathwork methods claim that breathing can be used to access nonverbal memories.
Rebirthing uses conscious breathing to purge repressed birth memories and traumatic childhood memories.
Holotropic Breathing was developed by Stanislav Grof and uses deepened breathing to allow access to non-ordinary states of consciousness.
Transformational Breath uses a full relaxed breath that originates in the lower abdomen and repeats inhalation and exhalation without pausing.
It integrates other healing modalities and breath analysis.
A key feature is intensive personal coaching and the use of 'bodymapping' (acupressure points).
Integrative Breathing combines specific benefits of various schools of conscious breathing according to the needs of clients.
Research considers drug abuse disorders, post traumatic stress disorder, alcoholism and smoking.
Taixi (embryonic breathing) 
(, "embryonic breathing" or "embryonic respiration") refers to Daoist meditation and Inner Alchemy methods, the principle of which is to breathe like an embryo or fetus in the womb, without using nose or mouth.
Techniques developed for embryonic breathing include "xingqi" (, "circulating breath"), (, "breath retention; apnea"), (, "ingesting breath; aerophagia"), and (, "embryonic eating; swallowing saliva").
In the history of Daoism, Tang dynasty (618-907) Daoist Internal Alchemists fundamentally changed the nature and understanding of embryonic breathing from the ancient theory of (, "external of the air; external breathing") to the new theory of (, "internal of one's organs; internal breathing").
Instead of inhaling and retaining air, adepts would circulate and remold visceral energy, which was believed to recreate the (, "prenatal ; primary vitality") received at birth and gradually depleted during human life. (, "embryonic breathing") was associated with the (, "sacred embryo; embryo of sainthood"), which was originally a Chinese Buddhist concept that Tang Daoists developed into a complex process of symbolic pregnancy giving birth to a spiritually perfected doppelganger of oneself.
Terminology.
() is a linguistic compound of two common Chinese words: 
Chinese () can ambiguously be translated as English embryo, fetus, or womb.
The Chinese lexicon differentiates this gestational semantic field with words such as (, "womb; placenta"), (, "embryo"), (, "embryo; beginning of things"), (, "fetus; embryo"), and (, literally "child palace", "uterus; womb").
Chinese () has various English translations.
Although these translations consistently use "embryonic" rather than , a newly developing human is typically referred to as an until the ninth week after conception, and subsequently referred to as a "fetus".
Catherine Despeux explains how "womb respiration" or "womb breathing" can alternately translate (), which refers to "a manner of respiration that does not involve the nose or the mouth but rather the pores of the skin."
When adepts are said to "breathe like an embryo", this expression may also denote the sensation of "something expanding and contracting, or 'breathing' somewhere inside their bodies".
And if the term is read as "womb" or "matrix," then takes on the sense of "womb respiration."
This introspective sensation of expansion and contraction attributed to a breathing embryo is firmly situated in the lower or lower abdomen, where the womb is located (2016: 163).
In Daoist textual terminology, one (, "inhalation; breathing in") and one (, "exhalation; breathing out") comprise one (, "respiratory cycle")—compare the common word (, "breath, breathing; inhalation and exhalation").
Generally speaking, the air was to be inhaled through the nose, retained as long as possible with the (, "breath-holding") technique, and then exhaled through the mouth.
This presents an "obvious parallel with the conviction that there was vitality in certain secretions of the body so that all losses of them should be avoided."
(Needham 1983: 143).
Ancient Theory of External Breaths.
Kristofer Schipper notes that, "embryonic breathing is not a late development in the breathing exercises, but has always existed under different names" (1993: 242).
As Daoist adepts began to practice embryonic breathing, "things got to be horribly varied and complicated", they developed myriad, and sometimes contradictory, techniques such as the "holding of breath, slowing of breathing, swallowing of air, swallowing of saliva, mental guiding of , and inner visualization of internal organs, colored or deities."
(Eskildsen 2015: 256).
The origins of the term embryonic breathing go back at least to the early centuries of the Common Era (Eskildsen 2015: 254).
The "Book of the Later Han", which was compiled in the 5th-century from late Han dynasty (202 BCE – 220 CE) sources, may be the earliest extant reference to (, "embryonic breathing") and the uncommon cognate (, "embryonic eating; saliva swallowing").
This historical text's biography of the ("esoteric master") Wang Zhen (, fl. c. 200) says that he looked under fifty years old when he was over a hundred.
It records that Wang and He Mengjie () were both from Shangdang (modern-day south and east Shanxi Province).
Wang Zhen practiced "embryonic breathing [], 'embryonic eating [],' subsistence on his own saliva [], and incessant bedchamber arts"; while He Mengjie had the "capacity to go without eating and shut up his breath []."
(tr. Campany 2002: 344; cf. Dewoskin 1983: 88, "methods of fetal breathing and fetal eating"; and Despeux 2008: 953, "were able to practice embryonic breathing and feed themselves like an embryo").
From this description of Wang Zhen, Eskildsen says, "it would appear as though the embryonic breathing method was perhaps not actually a breathing technique but rather a method of swallowing saliva.
However, it could be that the swallowing technique described here constitutes only 'embryonic eating,' and that there was an accompanying breathing technique that constituted embryonic breathing but is not described."
(2015: 254).
Li Xian's c. 675 commentary to the "Book of Later Han" notes, "To practice breath holding and gulping it down [] is called , to practice coughing up saliva and swallowing it [] is called ."
Both "embryonic fluid" ( ) and "pure water of the jade lake" ( ) refer to saliva, which is called the "water of life" and is supposed to prolong life.
The Han people already practiced the method of swallowing saliva to improve the physique and nurture life (Jia 2015: 15).
The Daoist scholar Ge Hong's 318 CE ("Master Who Embraces Simplicity") is described as "one of the major sources on breath control practices in pre-Tang China" (Sailey 1978: 341). is mentioned in three of the esoteric (, "Inner Chapters").
Chapter 19 ("A Taoist Library") is a bibliography that mentions a (, Classic of Embryonic Breathing), which is the name of the possibly related received text (discussed below).
Chapter 3 ("Rejoinder to Popular Conceptions") remarks that since a Daoist adept knows "the great age attained by tortoises and cranes, he imitates their calisthenics so as to augment his own life span", and quotes a (, "Transcendent Classic") poem: "He who swallows Cinnabar [alchemy] and keeps the One / Will only finish in Heaven / He who makes the Essence return and practises Embryonic Respiration / Will have longevity unlimited" (tr. Maspero 1981: 325; cf. Ware 1966: 54).
In Chapter 8 ("Resolving Hesitations"), Ge Hong praises embryonic breathing and tells a underwater breath-holding anecdote about his granduncle Ge Xuan (164–244), who was prominent in early Daoism and the first recipient of the Lingbao sacred scriptures.
Ge Hong seems to have understood as the culmination of long-term daily practice of "pneuma circulation" (Campany 2002: 365).
First, he describes as a potent panacea and gives a detailed description of timing breath-holding by counting heartbeats.
By practising the circulation of the [] [ ] one can cure the hundred diseases, one can walk through the midst of plagues and epidemics, one can ward off snakes and tigers, stop bleeding from wounds, stay under water or walk across it, free oneself from hunger and thirst, and protract one's years.
The most important thing is simply to (know how to) breathe like an embryo [].
He who can breathe like a foetus [] will respire [ ] as if still in the womb [], without using nose or mouth; thus will the Tao be achieved.
When one first begins to learn how to circulate the [], one must inhale through the nose and then close up that breath.
While it is thus hidden within, one counts up to 120 heart-beats [∼ 90 seconds], and then exhales it (gently) through the mouth.
Neither during exhalation nor inhalation should one hear with one's ears the sound of the breathing, and one should make sure that more goes in than comes out.
A wild goose feather may be placed in front of the nose and mouth, and during exhalation this should not show any movement.
After continual practice one may very gradually increase the number of heart-beats (during which the breath is held) to as much as 1000 [∼ 12 minutes 30 seconds], and when this proficiency is reached, an old man will be able to grow younger daily, returning [ ] to youth by one day every day. (tr. Needham 1983: 143-144)  
Compare Ware's translation, "The most important part of it is simply to breathe like a fetus.
He who succeeds in doing this will do his breathing as though in the womb, without using nose or mouth, and for him the divine Process has been achieved."
(1966: 138).
Second, in a context about how few people can successfully practice the art of breath circulation, Ge again mentions his granduncle.
"My ancestral uncle [Ge Xuan], whenever he was overcome by wine in the heat of the summer would incontinently retire to the bottom of a deep pool and stay there till the evening—this was because he could retain his breath [ ] and respire like a foetus in the womb []."
(tr. Needham 1983: 142; cf. Ware 1966: 140 "to hoard his breaths and breathe like a fetus").
The fetal condition "was considered worth reverting to because doing so was thought to constitute a reversal of the aging process and a restoration to the condition that existed when your vital forces had not yet begun to be expended."
(Eskildsen 2015: 255).
also occurs in one of the exoteric (, "Outer Chapters"): "It is like 'embryonic-breathing-in-which-the-Mystery-is-preserved' [].
In deep breathing we throw out the old and take in the new, retaining the vista and looking inwards."
(14, tr. Sailey 1978: 65).
The translator Sailey interpreted the practice of "breathing as in the embryo, … a kind of very deep breathing with both the nose and the mouth enabling one to achieve a state analogous to that of a foetus in a womb."
(1978: 341) 
In addition to the , Ge Hong wrote the c. 4th-century (with later additions) (Biographies of Divine Transcendents), which mentions in four hagiographies.
Two repeat the above phrase (, "embryonic breathing and embryonic eating").
The Wang Zhen () hagiography quotes the description of his "embryonic breathing, 'embryonic eating', subsistence on his own saliva" (tr. Campany 2002: 344).
The Ji Liao () or Ji Zixun () entry has two consecutive sentences, where Campany compared sources (2002: 412) and omitted the first "Because he proclaimed methods of embryonic breathing, embryonic eating, stopping aging, and turning white hair black again" [] and translated the second "In over two hundred years his countenance did not age."
(2002: 169).
The other two hagiographies mention in the phrase (, "embryonic breathing and inner visualization").
The entry for Huang Jing () records that "he is said to have circulated pneumas, abstained from grains, subsisted on his saliva, practiced embryonic breathing and interior vision" [] (tr. Campany 2002: 541).
The hagiography for Huang Hua () or Jiuling zi () says "He obtained Ways of turning back the years, banishing aging, and fetal breathing []" (tr. Campany 2002: 365).
The c. 4th-5th century CE ("Classic of the Great Peace") biography of the Daoist Zhou Yishan () says: "Every morning after dawn, when the sun was rising, he stood up straight facing due east, and having rinsed out his mouth, swallowed (much) saliva, then he absorbed the [ ] more than a hundred times.
This being done he turned towards the sun and saluted it twice.
And every morning he repeated these procedures."
(tr. Needham 1983: 143).
The air "must be inhaled slowly through the nose, held for as long as possible, and finally exhaled through the mouth" (Maspero 1981: 462).
The also ranks the importance of strict dieting for adepts practicing embryonic respiration, "In the first place feed upon airy breath [ ]; in the second place feed upon drugs; in the third place eat little."
The best diets, thus, were those that dispensed with all solid food; either feeding upon saliva, or upon air.
The first method was called "Embryonic Nourishment" ( , "swallowing saliva") with a name paralleling "Embryonic Respiration" ( ).
The second was called "Feeding upon Breath" ( or ) or "Feeding by Respiration" ( ) (Maspero 1981: 338).
Side effects.
Although the says that Ge Xuan could hold his breath underwater all afternoon, even allowing for typical hagiographic exaggeration, attempting extreme (, "breath-holding") could be dangerous for embryonic respiration practitioners.
According to the French sinologist Henri Maspero, Daoists believed that learning to hold one's breath for a long time extends the opportunity to feed upon it.
Commenting on the legend that Liu Gen () supposedly held his breath for three days before becoming a transcendent, "But what a long effort it takes to attain such mastery!
The practise of 'holding the breath in' is painful; it brings on all sorts of physiological difficulties, which the Adept has to surmount little by little."
(1981: 270).
Sometimes when an adept holds their breath for too long, "beads of sweat form and the head and feet become heated: this is because the breath is passing through them", and at other times from the strain of "holding the breath firmly, after some time, the belly aches."
(1981: 464).
In traditional Chinese beliefs, respiration is closely associated with digestion and circulation.
An adept who practices Embryonic Respiration "in a perfect fashion has no need for ordinary food" because they have "realized the Taoist ideal of 'Feeding upon Breath'" ( or ).
Feeding upon Breath could never have been more than a temporary diet; "for if it had been followed too long, death—or, if one wishes to express it in the Taoist way, the Liberation of the Corpse—would have occurred so regularly with the beginning of this practice that it would make the Adepts think again, and cause them to abandon so dangerous a procedure."
(Maspero 1981: 343).
Daoist technical terms for breath-holding used the word (, "Chinese classifier for actions"); a "small" () was 12 respiratory cycle suppressions [∼ 36 seconds], and a "large" () was 120 [∼ 6 minutes].
Joseph Needham imagines that "serious and painful effort was required", and quotes Sun Simiao's c. 652 (, "Essential Formulas [Worth] a Thousand Pieces of Gold"): "'At the end of 300 respiratory cycles [~ 15 minutes], the ears have no hearing left, the eyes see no more, the mind can no longer think; then one must stop holding the breath."
(tr. Needham 1983: 144).
The historian of Chinese science Joseph Needham describes the many side effects of and hypothesizes why early adepts eventually abandoned it.
This breath-holding technique produced considerable hypoxemia (insufficient oxygen in the blood) with its strange effects, "buzzing in the ears, vertigo, perspiration, sensations of heat and formication in the extremities, fainting and headache."
Furthermore, if Daoist breath-holding was practiced in temples on high mountains, it could result in chronic mountain sickness, with symptoms of "headache, dizziness, tinnitus, breathlessness, palpitations, sleep disturbance, fatigue, confusion, cyanosis, and notably loss of appetite."
This could have made the delimited diet of the recluses easier to bear, "contributing as it did in its turn to the reduction of cardiac strain and heightened awareness and well-being consequent on loss of all excess body-weight" (1983: 145).
Perhaps what happened was that the pre-[T]ang idea of the circulation of the [] gradually came to be more emphasized at the expense of the breath-holding—which might indeed have led to certain accidents just as the metallic elixirs did—and thus the breathing became secondary to an imaginative voluntary circulation of the [] of the internal organs, with the idea that the more this was done the more the [] of primary vitality would be re-formed.
This was a significant conceptual expansion, for the "essences" of all the organs were now emphasized as valuable, not only the saliva (from the lungs) and the semen (from the reins); and it did embody the truth that all the organs contribute their products to the blood-stream.
This inner round, it was thought, corresponded with the respiratory cycle though not part of it; when the external [] came upwards to be exhaled, the internal [] also came up from the lowest region of vital heat [], and when the air went down into the lungs in inspiration so also the internal [] pursued a downward path.
The expression [ , with "ingest; consume (esp. medicine)"] is now increasingly supplemented by the phrase [ , with "swallow; gulp"], a more specific term for swallowing; this was one process and the circulation was another.
(Needham 1983: 147-148)  
Tang Theory of Internal Breaths.
In what Joseph Needham called "an important turning-point" in the history of embryonic breathing, Henri Maspero revealed that "a great change which came over respiratory technology (if we might so call it)" towards the middle of the Tang dynasty (618-907) (1983: 147).
Daoist priests realized that breath circulation was not specifically Daoist, since the practice was common in traditional Chinese medicine and Chinese Buddhism."They discovered then that the men of old had interpreted the books wrongly, and that Embryonic Respiration was something else" (Maspero 1981: 465).
Instead of traditional Daoist adepts inhaling and circulating the (, "external of the air'"), Tang adepts would meditatively visualize manipulating and reshaping the (, "internal of one’s organs"), attempting to recreate their (, "original breath; primary vitality") received at birth and gradually used up in the course of life, which may be conserved but never replenished.
Xue Yannian (, 1252-1313) quotes the c. 664 (, "Scripture of Cavern Abyss") about the new Tang theory of two breaths.
The external breath, which when "dispersed, is like a cloud of smoke and, gathered together, is like hair, which is seen on the skin, which has the five colors, green, red, yellow, white, and black."
The internal breath of a person "comes from the Cinnabar Field, his breathing is deep; what it nourishes is distant, what it emits is thick.
In ordinary people, […] it "rises from the liver and the diaphragm: they breathe like monkeys and puff like rats."
(tr. Maspero 1981: 465) 
The c. 745 (, "Scripture on New and Old Methods for the Ingestion of Breath Collected by the Elder of Yanling", below) defines the technique: "One must carefully pull the breath while inspiring and expiring so that the Original Breath ( ) does not exit the body.
Thus, the outer and inner breaths do not mix and one achieves embryonic breathing."
According to the (, "Scripture of Embryonic Breathing", below) "the embryo is formed within the stored breath, and breathing occurs from within the embryo."
(tr. Despeux 2008: 953).
The Daoist and Buddhist literature on embryonic breathing expanded during the Tang and the early Song dynasty (960–1279) periods.
The following example texts dealing with are limited to major ones with reliable English translations.
The (, "Scripture of Embryonic Breathing"), a.k.a. (, the Exalted Jade Sovereign's Scripture on Embryonic Breathing), is a brief text of 88 characters that dates from circa 755 (Needham 1983: 385).
The above lists a book titled , but it is not mentioned in the bibliographic section of the 636 "Book of Sui".
The womb is formed from within the subdued .
The breathes from the inside of where there is a womb.
When enters the body, you live because of this.
When the spirit leaves the body, you die because of this.
If you know the spirit and , you can live long.
Firmly guard the empty nothingness and thereby nurture your spirit and .
When the spirit goes, the goes.
When the spirit stays, the stays.
If you want to live long, spirit and must concentrate on one another.
If your mind does not give rise to thoughts, it will not come and go.
Not leaving and entering, it naturally constantly stays.
To diligently practice this is the true road. (tr. Eskildsen 2015: 258; cf. Huang 1990: 41-44)  
Compare Frederic H. Balfour's early English translation: "The Embryo is formed by the concretion of concealed Breath; and the Embryo being brought into existence, the Breath begins to move in Respiration.
The entrance of Breath into the body is Life; the departure of the Spirit from the external form is Death."
(1884: 63).
The Tang (, "Commentary on the Scripture of Embryonic Breathing") is found in three versions of the Daoist Canon, two of which are accompanied by a commentary, and one attributes the text to Huanzhen Xiansheng (, late 9th century?) (Eskildsen 2015: 257).
The explains that practicing Embryonic Breathing will enable one to keep the Primordial Qi, have gods enter the body, and thus to attain immortality (Baldrian-Hussein 2004a: 367).
For instance, this commentary explains the first sentence.
The sea of breath lies three inches below the navel.
It is also (called) the lower [] (the elixir field.)
It is also (called) the dark female [ ].
People usually say that [] is the mouth and the nose.
That is wrong.
The mouth and the nose are the entering and exiting doors for [].
The word [] means (also) water, and the word [] means mother.
It is known in the world that the Yin and Yang breaths meet and coagulate, (originating) from a (father's) water (sperm) and a mother.
It becomes an embryo within three months.
The form is completed in ten months and has become a human being.
Those who are practicing the nourishing way [], store the breath beneath the navel and keep their soul inside their body.
Soul and breath combine together and produce the mysterious embryo.
Once the mysterious embryo is conceived, it will produce a body by itself.
This is the inner elixir and the way [] of nondeath. (tr. Huang 1990: 41).
The Tang (, "Songs and Instructions on the Secret Essentials of Embryonic Breathing") explains breathing techniques, proper diet, avoiding foods, and self-cultivation.
It begins: 
BLOCKING THE BREATH.
If you suddenly have a disease that does not involve an injury, gather up your mind and go to a room where you can be at ease.
Take off your clothes and lie down on your back on the bed and hold your fists tight.
Tap your teeth (often) and burn incense.
After you have swallowed 36 swallowings (and done the corresponding blockings) of the breath, the breath in the elixir field will exceed what is normally there.
Use your mind to guide it to where you feel the ailment.
That is the best way.
When perspiration appears, it is the sign to stop.
Do not do it in excess so you may reap the best benefits. (tr. Huang 1990: 47)  
This brief text about absorption of discusses dietetics, sexual hygiene, and the otherwise-unknown (, Six Qi) exercises to be practiced in times of illness (Baldrian-Hussein 2004b: 367).
The (, "Essay on the Subtlety of Embryonic Breathing") preceded the similarly titled below.
The quotes the in entirety.
It describes the method as equivalent with absorbing the Inner Breath through holding the breath and swallowing saliva seven times (Baldrian-Hussein 2004c: 373).
The beginning echoes the opening lines of the .
"Generally speaking, the womb is formed from within the .
The is produced from the breathing of the womb.
The womb gets completed from within the .
This is glossed as, "If the is pure, it will congeal and bind together.
If the is turbid, it will scatter and exit". (tr. Eskildsen 2015: 264).
Thus, whether the will either stay inside to form a womb or exit the body, is contingent upon the purity or turbidity of the itself, which the text does not explain.
The Daoist Shangqing School patriarch Sima Chengzhen (, 647-735) composed the 730 (, "Essay on the Essential Meaning of Breath Ingestion"), which presented integrated outlines of health practices, with both traditional Chinese physical techniques and the Buddhist-inspired practice of (, "insight meditation"), as preliminaries for attaining and realizing the Dao (Engelhardt 2000: 80).
The text is divided into nine sections ( , "essays; discourses"), describing the consecutive steps toward attaining purificatioin and longevity.
Some editions only have the first two (Baldrian-Hussein 2004d: 374).
The second section is the longest one and of central importance to embryonic breathing.
Adepts begin by absorbing the above (, Great Clarity Talisman for [Facilitating] Circulation), which enables one to gradually abstain from eating grains.
They then ingest by visualizing the first rays of the rising sun, guide it through the body and viscera, until they can permanently "retain the ".
Sima Chengzhen points out that when one begins abstaining from foods and survives only by ingesting breath (and repeats this warning for taking drugs), the immediate effect will be undergoing a phase of weakening and decay, but eventually strength returns all illnesses vanish.
Only after nine years of further practice will an adept rightfully be called a ("Realized One; Perfected Person").
(Englehardt 1989: 273).
The (, "Instructions of the Perfected Person on the Divine Operation of the Sacred Embryo") text attributes embryonic breathing methods to divinities like Laozi and Lishan Laomu; to semilegendary characters such as Bodhidharma, Zhang Guolao, Guiguzi, and Liu Haichan; to historical characters like Ge Hong and Chen Tuan; and to female adepts like He Xiangu (Despeux 2008: 954).
The preface to the Tang-era (, "Oral Explanation of Embryonic Respiration") abundantly explains the central role of emulating the fetus, navel, and belly.
That which is in the womb is called foetus, that which has been born is called child.
As long as the foetus is in the abdomen of the mother, its mouth is filled with a kind of mud [ ], and respiration [ ] does not penetrate there; it is through the navel (and the umbilical cord) that it receives (lit. "swallows") the [], and the nourishment for its bodily form.
Thus it is that it arrives at its completion.
Hence we know that the umbilicus [ ] is the 'gate of destiny' [ ].
Most babies, if they are alive at birth, fail for a short time to breathe in (the external air), but when the umbilical cord [ ] near the belly, is dipped into warm water three to five times, the infant 'resuscitates' (and breathes).
So indeed we know that the umbilicus is the 'gate of destiny', no mistake about it.
All those who wish to practise the Tao of reversion [ ] and to attain embryonic respiration must first know the source and origin of this, then they can do it themselves, breathing like the foetus in the mother's abdomen.
Hence the name (of the technique).
It is in reverting to the origin [ ] and regenerating the primary vitalities [ ] that old age can be chased away, and that one can return to the state of the foetus.
Truly there is a point in this (exercise).
Softly, gently, without holding the breath, that is the way to bring about the germination of the Tao of immortality.
(Needham 1983: 145-146; cf. Maspero 1981: 459-460)  
This all fitted together very reasonably.
Understanding that the mammalian embryo "breathes" through the placenta and the maternal circulation as well as gaining its nourishment, its food materials, through the same route, was an "excellent piece of early biological observation, as also the awareness of the occlusion of the foetal intestinal tract by the meconium".
Adepts who would recreate in themselves into the youthful perfection of the embryonic tissues must also cease mouth breathing.
"The subsequent insistence on the swallowing of saliva was also reasonable, as it could help to re-create the aquatic environment of the mammalian foetus" (Needham 1983: 146).
Li Fengshi's () late 8th-century (, "Mr. Grand-Nothingness of Sung Mountain's Manual of [Circulation]") stresses the importance of oral tradition.
The most important techniques of Taoism are not to be found in the books but rather in the instructions orally transmitted.
The procedures of absorbing the [] described in the two "Manuals of the Yellow Courts", with those called the "five ya ["sprouts"]" [ ] and the "six mou" [ ] all have to do only with the external [] (of the air).
But the [] of the external world is hard and powerful; it is not something coming from the interior (of the body), and so no benefit is to be gained by absorbing it.
As for the internal [], that indeed is what can be called (the breath of) "embryonic respiration" []; it exists naturally within (the body), it is not something which one has to go outside to borrow.
But if one does not obtain the personal explanations of an enlightened teacher, all one's efforts will be but labour and sorrow, and one will never succeed in one's objective. (tr. Needham 1983: 147)  
The contents of this work can be grouped under three headings: respiratory practices, dietary regimens and general recommendations, and the theory of Embryonic Breathing (Lévi 2004: 371), 
According to the (, "The Venerable Wang's Instructions for Absorbing , a Taiqing Scripture").
There were two ways of making it circulate [ ].
Concentrating the will to direct it to a particular place, such as the brain, or the site of some local malady, was termed [ ].
Visualising its flow in thought was "inner vision" [ , ], differentiated (not very convincingly to us) from ordinary imagination.
"Closing one's eyes, one has an inner vision of the five viscera, one can clearly distinguish them, one knows the place of each…"
(Needham 1983: 148)  
Based on texts like this, Needham proposes that "anatomical demonstrations may have taken place from time to time in the Taoist temples, and of course all possible parts of the domesticated mammals were eaten, so that there could have been much familiarity with their visceral and vascular system."
The passive method of letting the take its normal course in circulating, was called (, "casting it").
"Here the analogy with protochemical and metallurgical alchemy was close, as always when the word [ or , "smelt, refine"] appears, and the regions of vital heat doubtless represented the action of the fire upon metals and minerals."
Thus, the ancient retention of the breath was not entirely given up, but incorporated into the whole system of employing [ ]. (1983: 148).
practices continue in modern times.
Hsuan Hua (1918-1995), a Chinese monk of Chan Buddhism taught that the external breathing reaches a state of stillness in correct meditation: 
A practitioner with sufficient skill does not breathe externally.
That external breathing has stopped, but the internal breathing functions.
With internal breathing there is no exhalation through the nose or mouth, but all pores on the body are breathing.
A person who is breathing internally appears to be dead, but actually he has not died.
He does not breathe externally, but the internal breathing has come alive.
(Hsuan 2004: 44).
Interpretations.
Sinologists have varyingly interpreted the principles behind embryonic breathing practices.
Mircea Eliade said Chinese embryonic respiration was not like Indian yogic , "an exercise preliminary to meditation, nor an auxiliary technique, but sufficed in itself [...] to set in motion and bring to completion a 'mystical physiology'."
(1958: 71).
According to Jay Sailey, "The philosophical basis of the practice is simple enough: since while a man breathes he is alive, and when he stops breathing his life comes to an end, it is reasoned that is one could increase his intake of air and limit its outgo, then he could increase his lifespan."
(1978: 340-341).
Joseph Needham proposes that embryonic breathing techniques likely began with the observation that air was necessary for life, "and perhaps the idea that the more closely one could hug it to oneself the more it would contribute to life—thought of in our terms, it was as if by long retention of the inhaled air one could store an infinite abundance of oxygen.
Air was clearly a highly vivifying agent for the mortal body—therefore (by ancient logic) it followed that if only one knew what to do with it the body could be made immortal.
After all, before modern physiology, this was not so illogical."
(1983: 142).
He also says this "purposive" apnea (temporary cessation of breathing) was "accompanied by an interesting theory" of "embryonic respiration".
However, the Daoist embryonic respiration system involved a physiological fallacy, "no retention of the air could compensate for the absence of a placenta in the adult".
This somewhat parallels the Daoist sexual practice of (, "returning the sperm/essence to replenish the brain"), just as the semen was afterwards voided from the bladder by retrograde ejaculation and had no way to ascend to the brain such as the early Daoist physiologists imagined.
Nevertheless, the mistaken theory persisted for centuries, and early commentators described "reducing respiration to its utmost softness and imperceptibility". (1983: 145-146).
Needham concluded that "The circulation-mindedness of traditional Chinese physiological thought, so much in advance of the rest of the world, however archaic in form" is always worth emphasizing."
(1983: 146).
Xingqi (circulating breath) 
Chinese (, "circulating / breath") is a group of breath-control techniques that have been developed and practiced from the Warring States period (c. 475-221 BCE) to the present.
Examples include Traditional Chinese medicine, Daoist meditation, breathing calisthenics, embryonic breathing, internal alchemy, internal exercises, deep-breathing exercises, and slow-motion martial art.
Since the polysemous keyword can mean natural "breath; air" and/or alleged supernatural "vital breath; life force", signifies "circulating breath" in meditational contexts or "activating vital breath" in medical contexts.
Terminology.
() is a linguistic compound of two Chinese words: 
In Standard Chinese phonology, this character is usually pronounced as rising second tone above, but also can be pronounced as falling fourth tone () meaning "actions, conduct, behavior, custom(ary); [Buddhism] conditioned states, conditioned things [translation of Sanskrit ]" or second tone () "walkway, road; column, line, row, e.g., of soldiers, serried mountains, written text".
In terms of Chinese character classification, () was originally a pictograph of "crossroads", and () is a compound ideograph with (, "air; gas; vapor") and (, "rice"), " steam rising from rice as it cooks" (Bishop 2016). has an uncommon variant character () that is especially used in "magical" Daoist talismans, charms, and petitions.
The unabridged ("Comprehensive Chinese Word Dictionary"), which is lexicographically comparable to the "Oxford English Dictionary", defines in three meanings: 
There is no standard English translation of Chinese , as evident in: 
Within this sample, is most often translated as "circulate/circulating/circulation", but owing to the polysemous meanings of it is rendered as "breath", "vapor(s)", "pneuma(s)", or transliterated as .
Nathan Sivin rejected translating with the ancient Greek word ("breath; spirit, soul" or "breath of life" in Stoicism) as too narrow for the semantic range of "qi": 
By 350 [BCE], when philosophy began to be systematic, meant air, breath, vapor, and other pneumatic stuff.
It might be congealed or compacted in liquids or solids.
Qi also referred to the balanced and ordered vitalities or energies, partly derived from the air we breathe, that cause physical changes and maintain life.
These are not distinct meanings.
(Sivin 1987: 47)  
The term () is "so basic to Chinese worldviews, yet so multivalent in its meanings, spanning senses normally distinguished in the West, that a single satisfying Western language translation has so far proved elusive" (Campany 2002: 18).
In Chinese medical terminology, (, means "promote the circulation of "qì"; activate vital energy") parallels or colloquial (, "promote circulation of blood; activate the blood"), and is expanded in the phrasemes (, "set the in motion and disperse congelation") and (, "activate vital energy and release stagnation of emotions") (tr. Bishop 2016).
(, "control the breath; move through the body"; Bishop 2016) is a near-synonym of (, "circulate the breath").
When is pronounced with a neutral tone, () means "turn of events; luck, fortune, happiness".
Textual examples.
Methods for circulating breath are attested during the Warring States period (c. 475-221 BCE), continued during the Han dynasty (202 BCE-220 CE), became well known during the Six Dynasties (222-589), and developed during the Tang (618-907) and Song (960-1279) periods (Despeux 2008: 1108).
Warring States period.
In the history of Daoist meditation, several Warring States texts allude to or describe breath-control meditations, but none directly mention ().
Good examples are found in the and the ("Inner Training") chapter.
One context criticizes breath exercises and "guiding and pulling" calisthenics: "Blowing and breathing, exhaling and inhaling, expelling the old and taking in the new, bear strides and bird stretches []—all this is merely indicative of the desire for longevity."
(15, tr. Mair 1994: 145).
Another context praises "breathing from the heels: "The true man of old did not dream when he slept and did not worry when he was awake.
His food was not savory, his breathing was deep.
The breathing of the true man is from his heels [], the breathing of the common man is from his throat []."
(6, tr. Mair 1994: 52).
The translator Victor Mair notes the "close affinities between the Daoist sages and the ancient Indian holy men.
Yogic breath control and (postures) were common to both traditions," and suggests that "breathing from the heels" could be "a modern explanation of the 'supported headstand'". (1994: 371).
Verse 24 summarizes Inner Training breath control, which "appears to be a meditative technique in which the adept concentrates on nothing but the Way, or some representation of it.
It is to be undertaken when you are sitting in a calm and unmoving position, and it enables you to set aside the disturbances of perceptions, thoughts, emotions, and desires that normally fill your conscious mind."
(Roth 1999: 116).
&lt;poem&gt; 
Expand your heart-mind and release it [].
Relax your and allow it to extend [].
When your body is calm and unmoving, 
Guard the One [] and discard myriad disturbances.
You will see profit and not be enticed by it.
You will see harm and not be frightened by it.
Relaxed and unwound, and yet free from selfishness, 
In solitude you will find joy in your own being.
This is what we call "circulating the " [].
Your awareness and practice appear celestial []. (24, tr. Komjathy 2003: n.p.). &lt;/poem&gt; 
Translating "circulating the " follows commentaries that interpret this original (, "cloud") as a variant Chinese character for (, "transport; move"), thus reading (, "control the breath; move through the body").
Besides the Warring States-era received texts that mention breath circulation techniques, the earliest direct evidence is a Chinese jade artifact known as the (, Breath Circulation Jade Pendant Inscription) or (, Breath Circulation Inscription).
This 45-character rhymed explanation entitled "circulating the (vital) breath" was inscribed on a dodecagonal block of jade, tentatively identified as either a knob for a staff or a pendant for hanging from a belt.
While the dating is uncertain, estimates range from approximately middle 6th century BCE (Needham 1956: 143) to early 3rd century BCE (Harper 1998: 125).
This lapidary text combines nine trisyllabic phrases describing the stages of breath circulation with four explanatory phrases.
The jade inscription says: 
&lt;poem&gt;To circulate the Vital Breath []: 
Breathe deeply, then it will collect [].
When it is collected, it will expand [].
When it expands, it will descend [].
When it descends, it will become stable [].
When it is stable, it will be regular [].
When it is regular, it will sprout [].
When it sprouts, it will grow [].
When it grows, it will recede [].
When it recedes, it will become heavenly [].
The dynamism of Heaven is revealed in the ascending []; 
The dynamism of Earth is revealed in the descending [].
Follow this and you will live; oppose it and you will die [] (tr. Roth 1997: 298) &lt;/poem&gt; 
Han dynasty.
Han dynasty (202 BCE-220 CE) historical, medical, and philosophical texts mention circulating breath.
The (Records of the Grand Historian), compiled by Sima Tan and his son Sima Qian from the late 2nd century BCE to early 1st century CE, says turtles and tortoises are able to practice and .
Chapter 128 (, Arrayed Traditions of Tortoise and Yarrow-stalk [Diviners]), which Chu Shaosun (, c. 104-30 BCE) appended with a text on sacred tortoises used in plastromancy, claims that the longevity of tortoises results from breath circulation and calisthenics: "An old man in south used a tortoise as a leg for his bed, and died after more than ten years.
When his bed was removed, the tortoise was still alive.
Tortoises are able to practice breath circulation and calisthenics [].
Ge Hong's 4th-century (below) quotes 128 with a different version of this tortoise-bed legend [], with young rather than old men.
When the men living between the Yangtze and the Huai are young, they place their beds on tortoises, and their families do not remove the beds until those boys have died of old age."
Thus, these animals have lived at least fifty or sixty years, and, given that they can dispense this long with food or drink and still not die, it shows that they are far different from common creatures.
Why should we doubt that they can last a thousand years?
Isn't there good reason for the Genii Classics to suggest we imitate the breathing of the tortoise? (3, tr. Ware 1966: 56-57)  
Another interpretation is putting a tortoise into, rather than on a bed.
"It is allegedly common in the area of the Yangtse and the Huai to put a tortoise into the bed in childhood; when people die of old age, the tortoise is still alive. (tr. Eberhard 1968: 321).
This context repeatedly mentions cranes and tortoises (Chinese exemplars of longevity) using calisthenics without .
For instance, "Knowing the great age attained by tortoises and cranes, he imitates their calisthenics so as to augment his own life span" (Ware 1966: 53); "Therefore, God's Men merely ask us to study the method by which these animals extend their years through calisthenics and to model ourselves on their eschewing of starches through the consumption of breath" (1966: 58); "the tortoise and the crane have a special understanding of calisthenics and diet" (1966: 59).
The c. 2nd-century to 1st-century BCE (Inner Canon of the Yellow Emperor) uses () five times in the (, Basic Questions) and three in the (, Spiritual Pivot) sections.
For instances, the (, Treatise on How to Distinguish the Vascular System) section says, 
The force of the pulse flows into the arteries () and the force of the arteries ascends into the lungs; the lungs send it into all the pulses (), which then transport its essence to the skin and the body hair.
The entire vascular system unites with the secretions [] and passes the force of life on to a storehouse [], which stores the energy and vitality and intelligence.
These are then transmitted to the four (parts of the body), and the vital forces of the viscera are restored to their order. (21, tr. Veith 1949: 196)  
And (, Treatise on the Region of the Great Tin and on the Region of the 'Sunlight') says, 
The Great Yin of the foot means (relates to) the three Yin.
Its communication by way of the stomach is subject to the spleen and is connected with the throat; thus it is the great Yin which causes the communication to the three parts of Yin []. …
The five viscera and the six hollow organs are like an ocean (a reservoir ).
They also serve to transport vigor to the three regions of Yang [].
The viscera and the hollow organs, in reliance upon their direct communication, receive vigor from the region of the 'sunlight'.
Thus they cause the stomach to transport its fluid secretions. (29, tr. Veith 1949: 235-236)  
The c. 139 BCE is a Chinese collection of essays that blends Daoist, Confucianist, and Legalist concepts, especially including yin and yang and Wuxing (Five Phases/Agents) theories.
In particular, the (, Five Orbs/Viscera; heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys)are important to the because they provide a conceptual bridge among the cosmic, physiological, and cognitive realms.
In medical theory, each of the Five Orbs was correlated with one of the Five Phases of and was understood to be responsible for the generation and circulation of its particular form of throughout the mind-body system."
(Major 2010: 900). does not occur in this eclectic text but the "Originating in the Way" chapter describes circulating blood and "qi": "The mind is the master of the Five Orbs.
It regulates and directs the Four Limbs and circulates the blood and vital energy [], gallops through the realms of accepting and rejecting, and enters and exits through the gateways and doorways of the hundreds of endeavors. (1.17, tr. Major 2010: 71; cf. 7.3, 2010: 243).
The c. 1st-century CE text, which is traditionally attributed to Ban Gu (32–92 CE), frequently mentions the (Five Elements or Five Phases).
(, Heavenly Circulation of ) occurs in The Five Elements section explaining the () in "wuxing": "What is meant by the 'Five Elements' []?
Metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.
The word is used to bring out the meaning that [in accordance] with Heaven the fluids have been 'put into motion' []."
(tr. Tjan 1952: 429).
(, Five-Phases ) occurs in the "Instinct and Emotion" section: "Why are there five Instincts [] and six Emotions []?
Man by nature lives by containing the fluids of the Six Pitch-pipes [] and the Five Elements [].
Therefore, he has in [his body] the Five Reservoirs [] and the Six Storehouses [], through which the Instincts and Emotions go in and out."
(tr. Tjan 1952: 566).
Six dynasties.
The historical term "Six Dynasties" collectively refers to the Three Kingdoms (220–280 CE), Jin Dynasty (265–420), and Southern and Northern Dynasties (420–589).
The c. 3rd-4th century (, "Scripture of the Yellow Court") contrasts the respiration of ordinary people and Daoists inhaling through the nose and exhaling through the mouth.
Ordinary people's breath supposedly descends from the nose to the kidneys, traverses the Five Viscera (kidneys, heart, liver, spleen, and lungs), then the Six Receptacles (gall bladder, stomach, large intestine, small intestine, triple burner, and bladder), where it is blocked by the "Origin of the Barrier, [ , the Bl-26 acupuncture point], the double door of which is closed with a key and guarded by the gods of the spleen, both clad in red," whereupon the breath rises to the mouth and is exhaled (Maspero 1981: 341).
Daoist adepts knew how to control their breath to open these doors and lead it to the Lower Cinnabar Field or Ocean of Breath [ ], three inches below the navel.
Then is the moment of "leading the breath", [], in such a way that "the breaths of the Nine Heavens (= the inhaled air), which have entered the man's nose, make the tour of the body and are poured into the Palace of the Brain".
The "breath is led" by Interior Vision, [], thanks to which the Adept sees the inside of his own body and, concentrating his thought, steers the breath and guides it, following it by sight through all the veins and passages of the body.
Thus it is led where one wishes.
If one is sick (that is, if some passage inside the body is obstructed and hampers the regular passage of air), that is where one leads it to reestablish circulation, which produces healing.
The adept then circulates the Ocean of Breath to ascend the spinal column into the Upper Cinnabar Field (brain), go back down to the Middle Cinnabar Field (heart), when it is expelled by the lungs and goes out through the mouth.
(Maspero 1981: 342).
The Jin dynasty Daoist scholar Ge Hong's 318 ("Master Who Embraces Simplicity") frequently mentions "xingqi"; written (, with the standard character) 13 times and (, with the variant character typically used in magical Daoist talismans) 11 times.
In this text, the term "loosely designates various practices in which breath is swallowed and then systematically circulated (often guided by visualization) throughout the body.
Such practices were often understood as substituting pure cosmic pneumas for ordinary foods (especially grains and meats) as the staples of one's diet."
(Campany 2002: 133).
In several of Ge Hong's discussions of the sexual arts of self-cultivation, his consistent position is that they, "along with the circulation of pneumas, are necessary supplements [ ] to the ingestion of elixirs for the attainment of transcendence."
(Campany 2002: 31).
Chapter 8 ( "Resolving Hesitations") provides more detailed information about than any other chapter.
First, breath circulation should be practiced along with controlling ejaculation and taking Daoist drugs.
If you wish to seek divinity or geniehood [i.e., "xian" transcendence], you need only acquire the quintessence, which consists in treasuring your sperm [], circulating your breaths [], and taking one crucial medicine [].
That is all!
There are not a multitude of things to do.
In these three pursuits, however, one must distinguish between the profound and the shallow.
You cannot learn all about them promptly unless you meet with a learned teacher and work very, very hard.
Many things may be dubbed circulation of the breaths, but there are only a few methods for doing it correctly.
Other things may be dubbed good sexual practice, but its true recipe involves almost a hundred or more different activities.
Something may be dubbed a medicine to be taken, but there are roughly a thousand such prescriptions. (8, tr. Ware 1966: 138).
Second, Ge Hong lists the supernatural powers of and connects it with embryonic breathing.
Through circulation of the breaths [] illnesses can be cured, plague need not be fled, snakes and tigers can be charmed, bleeding from wounds can be halted, one may stay under water or walk on it, be free from hunger and thirst, and protract one's years.
The most important part of it is simply to breathe like a fetus [].
He who succeeds in doing this will do his breathing as though in the womb, without using nose or mouth, and for him the divine Process has been achieved. (8, tr. Ware 1966: 138-139),  
Third, he describes how a beginning breath circulation practitioner should count their heartbeats to measure time during (, "breath holding").
When first learning to circulate the breaths, one inhales through the nose and closes up that breath.
After holding it quietly for 120 heartbeats [approximately 90 seconds], it is expelled in tiny quantities through the mouth.
During the exhalations and inhalations one should not hear the sound of one's own breathing, and one should always exhale less than one inhales.
A goose feather held before the nose and mouth during the exhalations should not move.
After some practice the number of heartbeats may be increased very gradually to one thousand [approx. 12 minutes 30 seconds], before the breath is released.
Once this is achieved, the aged will become one day younger each day. (8, tr. Ware 1966: 138-139; times estimated by Needham 1983: 143-144)  
Fourth, using the ancient Chinese daily division between (, "living breath", from midnight to noon) and (, "dead breath", from noon to midnight), it warns, "The circulating of the breaths must be done at an hour when breath is alive, not when it is dead. …
No benefit is derived from practicing the circulating when breath is dead."
(8, tr. Ware 1966: 139).
Fifth, Ge advises maintaining moderation and tells an anecdote about his great-uncle Ge Xuan (164-244), a legendary Daoist who first received the Lingbao School scriptures.
It must be admitted, however, that it is man's nature to engage in multiple pursuits and he is little inclined to the peace and quiet requisite to the pursuit of this process.
For the circulation of the breaths it is essential that the processor refrain from overeating.
When fresh vegetables, and fatty and fresh meats are consumed, the breaths, becoming strengthened, are hard to preserve.
Hate and anger are also forbidden.
Overindulgence in them throws the breaths into confusion, and when they are not calmed they turn into shouting.
For these reasons few persons can practice this art.
My ancestral uncle, Ko Hsüan, merely because he was able to hoard his breaths and breathe like a fetus, would stay on the bottom of a deep pool for almost a whole day whenever he was thoroughly intoxicated and it was a hot summer's day. (8, tr. Ware 1966: 140).
Compare the above claim that with breath circulation, "one may stay under water or walk on it."
The repeatedly describes practicing breath circulation along with other longevity techniques, such as drug consumption and Daoist sexual practices above, which warns "one must distinguish between the profound and the shallow".
Another context compares these same three methods.
The taking of medicines [] may be the first requirement for enjoying Fullness of Life [], but the concomitant practice of breath circulation [] greatly enhances speedy attainment of the goal.
Even if medicines [] are not attainable and only breath circulation is practiced, a few hundred years will be attained provided the scheme is carried out fuIly, but one must also know the art of sexual intercourse [] to achieve such extra years.
If ignorance of the sexual art causes frequent losses of sperm to occur, it will be difficult to have sufficient energy to circulate the breaths. (5, tr. Ware 1966, 105).
Chapter 8 mentions the inherent dangers for Daoist adepts who overspecialize in studying a particular technique.
In everything pertaining to the nurturing of life [] one must learn much and make the essentials one's own; look widely and know how to select.
There can be no reliance upon one particular specialty, for there is always the danger that breadwinners will emphasize their personal specialties.
That is why those who know recipes for sexual intercourse [] say that only these recipes can lead to geniehood.
Those who know breathing procedures [] claim that only circulation of the breaths [] can prolong our years.
Those knowing methods for bending and stretching [] say that only calisthenics can exorcize old age.
Those knowing herbal prescriptions [] say that only through the nibbling of medicines can one be free from exhaustion.
Failures in the study of the divine process are due to such specializations. (8, tr. Ware 1966: 113).
In a final example, Ge Hong gives practical advice for avoiding illness.
If you are going to do everything possible to nurture your life [], you will take the divine medicines [].
In addition, you will never weary of circulating your breaths []; morning and night you will do calisthenics [] to circulate your blood and breaths and see that they do not stagnate.
In addition to these things, you will practice sexual intercourse in the right fashion []; you will eat and drink moderately; you will avoid drafts and dampness; you will not trouble about things that are not within your competence.
Do all these things, and you will not fall sick. (15, tr. Ware 1966: 252)  
Taking a fundamentally pragmatic position on "yangsheng" Nourishing Life practices, Ge Hong believes that "the perfection of any one method can only be attained in conjunction with several others."
(Engelhardt 2000: 77).
While several contexts mention healing oneself with breath circulation, one records using it to heal another person.
During the Eastern Wu dynasty (222-280), there was a Daoist master named Shi Chun () "who would not eat in order to hasten the cure when he was treating a sick person by circulating his own breath.
It would sometimes be a hundred days or only a month before he ate again."
When Emperor Jing of Wu (r. 258–364) heard about this he said, "In a short time this man is going to starve to death", and ordered that Shi be locked up and guarded constantly without food or water, excepting a few quarts he requested for making holy water.
After more than a year of imprisonment, his "complexion became ever fresher and his strength remained normal."
The emperor then asked him how much longer he could continue like this, and Shi Chun replied that "there was no limit; possibly several dozen years, his only fear being that he might die of old age, but it would not be of hunger."
The emperor discontinued the fasting experiment and released him (15, tr. Ware 1966: 248–249).
The bibliography of Daoist texts lists the (, Scripture on Treating Illness with Breath Circulation), which was subsequently lost.
Besides the , Ge Hong also compiled the (Biographies of Divine Transcendents), in which ten hagiographies mention adepts practicing along with other methods and techniques.
Tang dynasty.
During the Tang dynasty (618-907), Daoists integrated new meditation theories and techniques from Chinese Buddhism and many seminal texts were written, especially during the 8th century.
The Daoist Shangqing School patriarch Sima Chengzhen , 647–735) composed the 730 (, Essay on the Essential Meaning of Breath Ingestion), which presented integrated outlines of health practices, with both traditional Chinese physical techniques and the Buddhist-inspired practice of "guan" (, "insight meditation"), as preliminaries for attaining and realizing the Dao (Engelhardt 2000: 80).
The text is divided into nine sections ( , "essays; discourses") describing the consecutive steps toward attaining purification and longevity.
The second section "On the Ingestion of Breath" ( ) gives several methods for adepts to become independent of ordinary breathing, first absorb as breath, then guide it internally, and store it in their inner organs.
Adepts begin by absorbing the , Great Clarity Talisman for [Facilitating] Circulation), which enables one to gradually abstain from eating grains.
They then ingest by visualizing the first rays of the rising sun, guide it through the body and viscera, until they can permanently "retain the ".
Sima Chengzhen points out that when one begins abstaining from foods and survives only by ingesting breath (and repeats this warning for taking drugs), the immediate effect will be undergoing a phase of weakening and decay, but eventually strength returns all illnesses vanish.
Only after nine years of further practice will an adept rightfully be called a zhenren ("Realized One; Perfected Person").
(Englehardt 1989: 273).
The (, The Venerable Wang's Instructions for Absorbing Qi, a Taiqing Scripture) differentiates two methods of breath circulation.
There were two ways of making it circulate [ ].
Concentrating the will to direct it to a particular place, such as the brain, or the site of some local malady, was termed [ ].
Visualising its flow in thought was "inner vision" [ , ], differentiated (not very convincingly to us) from ordinary imagination.
"Closing one's eyes, one has an inner vision of the five viscera, one can clearly distinguish them, one knows the place of each…"
(Needham 1983: 148).
The c. 745 (, Scripture on New and Old Methods for the Ingestion of Breath Collected by the Elder of Yanling) defines the technique: "One must carefully pull the breath while inspiring and expiring so that the Original Breath ( ) does not exit the body.
Thus, the outer and inner breaths do not mix and one achieves embryonic breathing" (tr. Despeux 2008: 953).
This source also recommends the "method of the drum and of effort" ( ) breath circulation for creating a Sacred Embryo.
At the times when you are guiding the Breath, beat the drum [a technical term meaning "grit the teeth"] and perform ten swallowings, twenty swallowings, so that your intestines are filled.
After that concentrate upon guiding (the Breath) and making it penetrate into the four limbs.
When you are practicing this method, guide the Breath once for each time you swallow.
The hands and feet should be supported on things; wait until the Breath has penetrated, and then the heart must be emptied and the body forgotten; and thereupon the hot breath [ ] will be dispersed throughout the four limbs; the breath of the Essential Flower [ ], being coagulated, will return to the Ocean of Breath [ ].
After some time, the Embryo will be completed spontaneously.
By holding the joints of the members firm, you can succeed in having (the Breaths) answer one another with the sound of thunder; the drum resounds in the belly so that the Breaths are harmonized. "(tr. Maspero 1981: 481)  
Li Fengshi's () c. 780 (, Mr. Grand-Nothingness of Song Mountain's Scripture on Breath) discusses how one's (, "intention; will") plays a major role in circulating breath (Despeux 2008: 1108).
For instance, using breath-holding to heal oneself.
If suddenly there is discomfort in cultivating and nourishing (the breath) or occasionally there is some kind of illness, go into a secluded room and follow this method: spread out your hands and feet, then harmonize the breath and swallow it down (guiding it in your thoughts) to where the trouble is.
Shut off the breath.
Use the will and the mind to regulate the breath in order to attack the ailment.
When the breath has been retained to the extreme, exhale it.
Then swallow it again.
If the breathing is rapid, stop.
If the breath is harmonious, work on the ailment again. …
Even if the ailment is in your head, face, hands or feet, wherever it is, work on it.
There is nothing that will not be cured.
Note that when the mind wills the breath into the limbs, it works like magic, its effects are indescribable. (tr. Huang 1988: 22)  
The (, Secret of Guiding the Breath) chapter describes circulating breaths between the upper and lower (, "elixir fields"): (, "muddy pellet elixir-field", or "brain palace") and (, "lower elixir-field", above the perineum).
There are two points on the spine behind the lower [].
They correspond through the ridge vein with the [] which is the brain palace (a point between the eyes above the root of the nose).
The Original Breath [] is obtained by storing (the breath of) every three consecutive swallowings in the lower [].
Use the mind to take (the Original Breath) in and to make it enter the two points.
(You should) imagine two columns of white breath going straight up on both sides of your spine and entering the [] to becloud thickly the palace.
Then the breath continues to your hair, your face, your neck, both arms and hands up and to your fingers.
After a little time, it enters the chest and the middle [] which is (by) the heart.
It pours on into the five viscera, it passes the lower [], and reaches [ ] (the Three Miles, i.e., the genitals) It goes through your hips, your knees, ankles and all the way to the [ ] (acupuncture points) which are in the center of your feet soles.
That is the so-called [] "to share one breath and manage it individually". (tr. Huang 1988: 18-19)  
The late 8th-century () explains how to circulate the Original Breath.
Tang Daoist practitioners fundamentally changed the nature and understanding of Embryonic Breathing from the ancient theory of ), "external of the air; external breathing") to the new theory of (, "internal ") of one's organs; internal breathing").
Instead of inhaling and holding breath, adepts would circulate and remold visceral energy, which was believed to recreate the ( "prenatal "qi"; primary vitality") received at birth and gradually depleted during human life.
According to the , since it is the Original Breath and not external breath which must be kept circulating through the body, and since its natural place is within the body, there is no need to make it enter or hold it in by effort as the ancients did: no retention of the breath, which is exhausting and, in some cases, harmful.
But it does not follow that to make the breath circulate is an easy thing; on the contrary, it requires a lengthy apprenticeship.
"The internal breath... is naturally in the body, it is not a breath which you go outside to seek; (but) if you do not get the explanations of an enlightened master, (all efforts) will be nothing but useless toil, and you will never succeed."
Common ordinary respiration plays only a secondary role in the mechanism of Breath circulation, which goes on outside it.
The two breaths, internal and external, carry on their movements in perfect correspondence.
When the external breath ascends during inhalation, the internal breath contained in the lower Cinnabar Field also rises; when the external breath descends, the internal breath descends too and returns again to the lower Cinnabar Field.
Such is the simple mechanism which governs the circulation of Original Breath.
(Maspero 1981: 468) 
This is done in two phases: "swallowing the breath" [ ] and making it circulate.
And if there is only a single way of absorbing the Breath, there are two distinct ways of making it circulate.
One consists of leading it so as to guide it where one wishes it to go, to an afflicted area if it is to cure a malady, to the [] if Embryonic Respiration is the purpose, and so on.
This is what is called "guiding the breath" [].
The other consists of letting the breath go where it will through the body without interfering by guiding it.
This is what is called "refining the breath" [].
I shall point out in succession the methods for absorbing the breath, for guiding it, and for refining it.
It is the first of these two pulses.
Absorbing the Breath, which is properly to be called Embryonic Respiration []: but the expression is applied also to the exercises "in toto".
(Maspero 1981: 469–470).
Song dynasty.
breath circulation continued developing during the Song (960-1279).
Among the many progressive series of Daoist breath-circulating exercises ascribed to famous masters such as Chisongzi and Pengzu, one more complex set is attributed to the lesser-known Master Ning, the (, Master Ning's Gymnastic Method).
According to traditions, Master Ning was the Yellow Emperor's Director of Potters ( ).
"He could gather up fire and not burn himself, and he went up and down with the smoke; his clothes never burned."
(Maspero 1981: 543).
His method "was a series of magical procedures endowed with a specific efficacy, allowing one to go into fire without being burned and into water without drowning, in imitation of Master Ning himself.
It included a method of guiding the breath, [], and contained four series of exercises in which rhythmic breathing, retention of breath, and movements of arms, legs, head, and torso were done successively."
Each of these series was named after a particular animal: the breath-guiding procedures of the Toad, Tortoise, Wild Goose, and Dragon, with exercises representing the movements and breathing of these animals.
For instance, the "Dragon Procedure of Circulating the Breath":  
Ceng Cao's () 12th-century quotes Master Ning: "Guiding the Breath, [], controls the inside, and Gymnastics, [], controls the outside."
(tr. Maspero 1981: 542).

The (, Principles of Inner Nature and Vital Force) is a comprehensive Ming dynasty (1368-1644) text on ("internal alchemy") self-cultivation techniques, which syncretistically quotes sources from the Three teachings of Daoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism (particularly the Yogachara school), and is richly illustrated with over fifty illustrations that later texts widely copied.

Textual history.
The origins of the are obscure, but since it quotes several Ming dynasty writers, such as Luo Hongxian (1504-1564), it can be dated to the late 16th century (Little 2000: 349).
After its first edition in 1615, the was frequently republished; notably 1622 during the Ming dynasty, 1669 and 1670 during the Qing dynasty (1636-1912), in Ding Fubao's 1922 (, Record of the Essential Splendors of the Daoist Canon), and in the Beijing White Cloud Temple's 1989 edition (Darga 2008: 1006).
The text includes four prefaces, written by She Yongning (, fl. 16th-17th century, dated 1615), Zou Yuanbiao ( 1551–1624, estimated 1622), You Tong (, 1618–1704, dated 1669), and Li Pu (, ?- 1670, dated 1670) (Darga 2008: 1107).
The book's author remains unknown.
These four early prefaces all say the text was written down by master Yin Zhenren's (, "Perfected Yin") "gaodi": either literally (, "high-level disciple; senior disciple") or the disciple's proper name Gao Di ( or ; compare other Gao Dis).
The identities of both this master and his disciple are ambiguous (Darga 2008: 1106).
The name Yin Zhenren (, "Perfected [Master] Yin") combines the Chinese surname Yin with the standard Daoist ("Perfected Person") honorific term for a transcendent.
One authorial hypothesis is that Yin Zhenren conceivably dictated the through planchette writing or spirit writing.
The Daoist Canon contains several texts supposedly produced from spirit-writing.
Some examples are the (, Record of the Traces of the Dao Left by Numinous Spirits and Immortals), the (, Echoes of Cranes' Songs), and the (, Literary Masterpieces of the Xu Immortals) (Despeux 2008: 428).
If the was produced through spirit writing, two possible Daoist masters surnamed Yin are Yinxi (), a legendary gatekeeper who persuaded Laozi to write the before leaving China to travel West, and Yin Zhiping (, 1169–1251), the second patriarch of Quanzhen School Daoism (Burton-Rose 2009: 11).
Besides the , another Neidan text retrospectively attributed to Yin Zhenren or Yin Pengtou (, "Disheveled Yin") is the (, Questions and Answers of the [Eastern Cloister of the] Liaoyang Hall).
Min Yide () edited it around 1830 from a manuscript preserved in the Qingyang Daoist Temple in Chengdu (Needham and Lu 1983: 224, 234).
's lexical components are (, "high; tall; eminent; surname"), (,"younger brother; junior; [ ] disciple"), and (, "indicator of ordinal numerals; sequence, order; rank, grade"). (, "brilliant disciple; high-level student") and (, "high-ranking [especially in imperial civil-service examinations]") were sometimes used interchangeably.
She Yongming's first edition 1615 preface explicitly refers to (, "Yin Zhenren's disciple Gao Di"—using the name Di () and (, "disciple").
Both You Tong's 1669 () and Li Pu's 1670 () descriptions can alternatively be read as "high disciple" or as "Gao Di".
Zuo Yuanbiao's1622 forward () writes Gao's given name as instead of .
Needham and Lu translate Gao Di () as a proper name (1983: 231).
One scholar tentatively identifies the disciple Gao Di with a Ming dynasty scholar.
The 1739 "History of Ming" ( 257) records that Gao Di () received a degree in 1589 and opposed the eunuch dictator Wei Zhongxian (Skar 2002: 198).
Contents.
The syncretistic is notable for comprehensive explanations, numerous woodcut illustrations, and explicit depictions of the nine stages of transformation.
The wide-ranging is praised by the historians of Chinese science Joseph Needham and Lu Gwei-djen as, "a treatise of substantial size which might be regarded as the of physiological alchemy []."
(1983: 229).
The text is divided into four (, "collections of writings; books"): (, "primary"), (, "go smoothly"), (, "benefit") and (, "loyal"), which is a Classical Chinese allusion to the first sentence of the commentary on Hexagram 1 (, "force; creative"): "The Creative works sublime success, furthering through perseverance" []. (tr. Wilhelm and Baynes 1967: 4).
These four books present an overview of basic principles.
Book 1 has twenty-three (, "explanations; discourses; narrations") that outline the foundations of Internal Alchemy.
Books 2-4 give diverse (, "secret oral instructions") that explain practices in more detail; each book contains three main chapters, organized in correspondence with the Quanzhen (, Mysterious Practice in Nine Stages) of internal alchemical transformation.
All four books contain (, "illustrations; diagrams; charts") accompanied by short texts, frequently in the form of rhymed poems (Darga 2008: 1107).
The textual organization "outlines the adept's progress in four clear parts."
Book 1 begins with defining basic concepts and clarifying terms; Book 2, called "nourishing the original source," deals with cultivating and strengthening one's physical energies; Book 3 establishes an active relationship between the physical and the heavenly, described as the "union of [the trigrams] (☰) and (☰)"; Book 4 describes liberation from the world, when the Sacred Embryo develops and grows, "goes beyond all, and merges with emptiness".
(Kohn 2000: 545).
The quotes from Confucian, Lao-Zhuang, Daoist, and Buddhist sources.
One of the main concerns of the is to lead the adept through the multitude of alchemical methods and writings to the core of the true path of .
This core is to be sought at the basis of all phenomena and is proof of the undivided unity and the unchanging nature of the Dao.
The author approaches this core from a variety of perspectives, employing a wealth of concepts but always returning to the central theme.
He does not give any practical instructions for practicing inner alchemy, however; in fact, he dissociates himself from specific exercises, as these belong to the phenomenal domain from which he tries to lead away his readers.
(Darga 2008: 1107)  
In the Quanzhen lineages the is usually classified as belonging to the (, Northern Lineage) or the ( Central Branch) of Ming and Qing .
Its ideas are mainly based on Zhang Boduan's (, 987?-1082) (Folios on Awakening to Reality / Perfection) and Li Daochun's (, fl. 1288–1292) (, The Book of Balance and Harmony), and are also closely related to other Quanzhen School texts.
(Darga 2008: 1107).
Despite the 's detailed coverage of Daoist Internal Alchemy, such as a "wonderful list of the chief varieties of the 'three thousand six hundred' techniques [ (, lit. "side door", "improper means"]" practiced by men and women adepts, many Western sinologists have misconstrued it.
John Dudgeon (1895) mistook the text for a manual of gymnastics, while Richard Wilhelm and Carl Jung (1931) used it "iconographically without much understanding" (Needham and Lu 1983: 231).
Wilhelm and Jung's "The Secret of the Golden Flower" used four illustrations— without citing the source—to depict the stages of meditation, for example, the uncredited "Ying'er xianxing" (, Revealing the Sacred Embryo) illustration is on the first edition cover, although the book does not mention the Internal Alchemical ("sacred embryo, embryo of sagehood") concept.
Examples.
The following four sample illustrations demonstrate the text's comprehensive treatment of Internal Alchemy.
Two examples depict alchemical reaction-vessels and culturally symbolic animals, and two others show Daoist "inner landscape" diagrams of the human body.
The first two examples, called the "Illustration of Bringing Together the Four Symbols" and "Illustration of the Marriage of the Dragon and the Tiger" both depict Chinese mythical animals and an alchemical cauldron, either round vessels with three legs or rectangular ones with four.
In Outer Alchemy, the laboratory cauldron was originally used to heat elixir ingredients, while in later Outer Alchemy, Daoist practitioners semantically extended the word to mean the metaphorical cauldron allegedly located in the lower of the human body, wherein an adept cultivated the Three Treasures of Jing ("Essence"), Qi ("Breath"), and Shen ("Spirit").
The Four Symbols are mythological creatures appearing among the Chinese constellations along the ecliptic, and viewed as the guardians of the four cardinal directions.
The Black Tortoise (an entwined tortoise and snake) of the North shown on the bottom, represents water and the kidneys; the Vermilion Bird of the South on the top, represents fire and the heart; the Azure Dragon of the East on the right, represents wood and liver; and the White Tiger of the West shown on the left, represents metal and the lungs (Little 2000: 349).
This directional representation of top as bottom and right as left is inverted, "like so much else in physiological alchemy" (Needham and Lu 1983: 58).
This Four Symbols illustration shows the symbolical animals of the four directions surrounding and influencing the bodily alchemical crucible, here labeled (, "realized will").
The realized will is explained in the text as "the prime of the trigram [(, ☰,) three unbroken lines], the mother of the heavens and the earth, the root of and , the source of water and fire, the ancestor of the sun and moon, the font of the three materials [the heavens, the earth, and humanity], and the progenitor of the Five Phases."
(Little 2000: 349).
In the top right inscription, the word (, "not leaking"; or [Buddhist] "passionless", from Sanskrit ) refers to that which "normally 'leaks out' through the sense-organs and other parts of the body" (Needham and Lu 1983: 252) 
The "Illustration of the Marriage of the Dragon and the Tiger" (tr. Little), or "The Love-Making of Dragon and Tiger" (tr. Needham and Lu), title uses (, have sexual intercourse; mate").
The Azure Dragon, symbol of , and the White Tiger, symbol of , are shown infusing their energies into the alchemical crucible.
A girl dressed in blue-green robes rides the dragon, symbol of within , while a white-faced boy rides the tiger, symbol of within .
(Needham and Lu 1983: 104).
These images suggest the trigrams (, ☲, two unbroken lines enclosing a broken line) and (, ☵, two broken lines enclosing an unbroken line), which represent toxic mercury and lead, the two fundamental elements transformed in Inner Alchemy.
(Little 2000: 349).
The dragon and tiger symbolizing the Yang and Yin was shown on many old Chinese numismatic charms and amulets (Needham and Lu 1983: 95).
The last two examples, called the Illustration of Broad Illumination and the Illustration of Reverse Illumination—or "Universal Radiance" and "The Glory of Reversion" (Needham and Lu)—show the inner landscapes of the anterior and posterior human body.
The front Illustration of Broad Illumination depicts a meditator sitting cross-legged, and shows three circles.
His right hand holds a hare enclosed in a circle, symbolizing of the mythological moon rabbit, and his left hand holds a crow enclosed in a circle, an ancient symbol of the three-legged sun crow.
On his forehead the three-character phrase (, "to join endowment and vitality") is enclosed in another circle.
These three circles represent the and energies of the body to the left and the right, and their union in the center.
The crescent shown on the meditator's abdomen represents the alchemical reaction vessel in the lower ("cinnabar field; energy center") (Little 2000: 348).
However, the 1615 first edition more complexly pictured the crescent above a rectangle and a crucible in the lower (see Wellcome Collection under External links).
According to Needham and Lu, this illustration shows "the triumphant adept with the sun in one hand and the moon in the other, Yin and Yang united" within the elixir; and in this context, and the in means "vital internal warmth", thus, could be thought of as production centers of "animal heat" (1983: 95, 38).
The back Illustration of Reverse Illumination shows the vertebral column, which is flanked by the (anatomically misplaced) "kidneys" in the lower back; which are respectively labeled as (, "dragon fire") on the right, a symbol of energy within the side of the body, and (, "tiger water") on the left, a symbol of energy within the side of the body.
The head circle, which corresponds to the "to join endowment and vitality" above, encloses the word (, "original spirit"), one of the "sanyuan" (, "three origins"), along with the (, "original essence" and 'yuanqi' (, "original breath").
(Little 2000: 348-349).0 
This Reverse Illumination drawing shows twenty-four "vertebra", labeled with the traditional Chinese medical acupoint names for fourteen of the twenty-eight points on the () Governing Vessel, from GV-1 (, Long and Strong) to GV-14 (, Great Vertebra), between the coccyx and the anus.
This location is associated with the ancient Daoist sexual theory of male avoidance of ejaculation, called (, "returning the semen to replenish the brain"); Daoist physiologists imagined that unejaculated (, " semen; [medical] essence of life") could rise up the spine into the brain in order increase health and longevity (cf. the Indian "susumna" channel).
The common method of preventing ejaculation was to apply pressure on the perineum, halfway between the anus and the scrotum, resulting in retrograde ejaculation redirecting semen into the urinary bladder, where it was subsequently voided.

Agni (Ayurveda) 
Agni in Samskrita means "fire", and according to Ayurveda, Agni happens to be the entity that is responsible for all digestive and metabolic processes in the human beings.
Classification of Agni based on its location.
Depending upon the stage of metabolism where a specific Agni is functionally active, Agni has been classified into three sub-classes: 'Jaṭharāgni', 'Bhūtāgni' and 'Dhātvagni'.
Jaṭharāgni.
While Jaṭharāgni acts on the food in the digestive tract and converts it into absorbable form, the Bhūtāgni acts after the digested material has been absorbed.
Bhūtāgni.
Bhūtāgni is of 5 types.
Each of these 5 acts on the 5 primordial constituents of the absorbed food: Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Space.
These 5 Bhutagnis transform the substrates into such form that can be assimilated at tissue level.
Dhātvagni.
The third class of Agni, the Dhātvagni, acts at the level of tissue metabolism and is helpful in the tissue nourishment tissue metabolism.
This is of 7 types based on the kind of tissue that it helps nourishing.
Classification of Agni based on its strength.
Further, Ayurveda recognizes four functional states of Agni: Samāgni(regular), Vişamāgni (irregular), Tīkşņāgni(intense), and Mandāgni(weak).
Samāgni.
Samāgni ensures complete digestion of the food ingested at the proper time without any irregularity.
Its activity is neither too intense nor too weak.
It is just appropriate and therefore, is ideal too.
This results when all Doshas, Vata-Pitta-Kapha are in a state of equilibrium.
Vişamāgni.
Vişamāgni represents an unpredictable state of Agni, which is due to the dominance of Vayu.
It sometimes quickly digests the food and at other times it does so very slowly, representing unpredictability.
Tīkşņāgni.
Tīkşņāgni results because of the dominance of Pitta which is intense, and hence, it easily digests even a very heavy meal, in a very short span of time.
Mandāgni.
Mandāgni is opposite to the Tīkşņāgni: it is subdued in its activity.
This Agni is unable to digest and metabolize even a small quantity of food.
This state of Agni is a result of the dominance of Kapha.
Brhat Trayi 
The Bṛhat-Trayī, literally translated as "The Great Triad (Of Compositions)", refers to three early Sanskrit encyclopaedias of medicine, which are the core texts of the indigenous Indian medical system of Ayurveda.
These are contrasted with the Laghu-Trayī or the "lesser triad", a secondary set of later authoritative compositions.
This classification was first devised probably at some time in the early twentieth century, although its earliest use has not yet (2022) been identified.
The classification is not known to Sanskrit authors.
It is part of the creation of a formal canon for ayurvedic literature.
There are older medical encyclopaedias than are not included in the Bṛhat-Trayī, for example the "Bheḷa-saṃhitā".
Overview.
The following three works constitute the Bṛhat-Trayī: 
The "Bṛhat-Trayī" or "Triad of the Great" is also sometimes called the "Vṛddha-Trayī", which means "the triad of the old/mature (classics or authors)".
All three works have been published in numerous Sanskrit editions, and all have been translated into English more than once.
The English translations of P. V. Sharma and of Srikantha Murthy are considered among the better ones.
The German translation of the Ashtanga Hridayam by Hilgenberg and Kirfel is widely considered the very best and scholarly translation available.
Agada 
Agada is one of the eight branches into which ayurveda medicine is traditionally divided.
Literally, "gada" means a disease and "agada" means any agent which makes the body free from disease; however the term "agada" is used specifically for the branch of medicine dealing with toxicology, the description of the different types of poisons, and their antidotes.
"Agada Tantra" is defined as a section of toxicology that deals with food poisoning, snakebites, dog bites, insect bites, etc.
The school of toxicology was founded and expounded upon by Kashyapa, also known as Vriddhakashyapa, a contemporary of Atreya Punarvasu.
He lived in Taksashila in what is now Pakistan.
His text was called the "Kashyapa Samhita".
This, however, is a different book than the "Kashyap Samhita" of pediatrics.
This text is not available now but the references of this text are found mentioned in different commentaries.
Some other texts written by Alambayana, Ushana, Saunaka, and Latyayana were known to exist.
However except for references to them, the original texts are no longer available.
The traditional practice of toxicology is still practiced by different families of vishavaidyas (poison doctors) who specialize in toxicology.
However, their knowledge is limited compared to the knowledge possessed by the earlier ayurvedic physicians.
In ancient times, it was the job of Vishavaidyas to protect members of the royal families from being poisoned, as well to poison enemies of the kings.
Rasayana 
Rasāyana (रसायन) is a Pali and Sanskrit word literally meaning "path" ("ayana") "of essence" ("rasa").
It is an early ayurvedic medical term referring to techniques for lengthening lifespans and invigorating the body.
It is one of the eight areas of medicine in Sanskrit literature.
In Vedic alchemical context, "rasa" also translates to "metal or a mineral"  
History.
The more general name for the Indian science of alchemy or proto-chemistry is "Rasaśāstra (रसशास्त्र in Sanskrit)", or "The Science of Mercury," in Nepali, Marathi, Hindi, Kannada and several other languages.
Early Indian alchemical texts discuss the use of prepared forms of mercury or cinnabar (see samskaras).
However, there is also ample mention of the preparation of medical tinctures in the early science of Indian alchemy.
Significant progress in alchemy was made in ancient India.
An 11th-century Persian chemist and physician named Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī reported "[the Indians] have a science similar to alchemy which is quite peculiar to them.
They call it "Rasâyana", a word composed with "rasa", i.e., gold.
It means an art which is restricted to certain operations, drugs, and compound medicines, most of which are taken from plants.
Its principles restore the health of those who were ill beyond hope, and give back youth to fading old age..."
Two famous examples were Nagarjunacharya and Nityanadhiya.
Nagarjunacharya , was one of the most prominent chemists in the history of Indian alchemy.
He ran many experiments in his laboratory known as the "Rasashala".
His book, "Rasaratanakaram" is a famous example of ancient Indian medicine, in which he describes the procedure of transmuting base metals like mercury, into gold.
Due to his great contributions and insight in chemistry, he was appointed as chancellor in the university of Nalanda.
From the 14th century onwards, many materials from "rasāyana" and "rasaśāstra" were translated and integrated in the Persian texts written by Muslim scholars in South Asia (Speziale 2019).
Aim and types.
Rasayana therapy enriches rasa with nutrients to help one attain longevity, memory, intelligence, health, youthfulness, excellence of luster, complexion and voice, optimum development of physique and sense organs, mastery over phonetics, respectability and brilliance.
Goals.
The historical aims of "rasāyana" were diverse, but the effects attributed to a treatment were typically either longevity, health, intellect, sexuality or magical abilities.
In essence, "rasāyana" promotes aspects of vitality.
Types of rasayana.
In pursuit of these matters, herbal prescriptions with many herbal substances, preserved in ghee and honey are given.
Chyawanprasha is one of the traditional rasayanas.
Specific adaptogenic herbs are also included in rasayanas including haritaki, amla, shilajit, ashwaganda, holy basil, guduchi and shatavari.
Several rasayana herbs have been tested for adaptogenic properties: 
The whole, aqueous, standardized extracts of selected plants (Tinospora cordifolia, Asparagus racemosus, Emblica officinalis, Withania somnifera, Piper longum and Terminalia chebula) were administered orally to experimental animals, in a dose extrapolated from the human dose, following which they were exposed to a variety of biological, physical and chemical stressors.
These plants were found to offer protection against these stressors, as judged by using markers of stress responses and objective parameters for stress manifestations.
Using a model of cisplatin induced alterations in gastrointestinal motility, the ability of these plants to exert a normalizing effect, irrespective of direction of pathological change was tested...
All the plant drugs were found to be safe in both acute and subacute toxicity studies.
Studies on the mechanisms of action of the plants revealed that they all produced immunostimulation.
The protection offered by Tinospora cordifolia against stress induced gastric mucosal damage was lost if macrophage activity was blocked.
Emblica officinalis strengthened the defence mechanisms against free radical damage induced during stress.
The effect of Emblica officinalis appeared to depend on the ability of target tissues to synthesize prostaglandins.
Recent data obtained with Tinospora cordifolia have led researchers to suggest that it may induce genotypic adaptation, further opening the arena for more research and experimentation.
Rasayana formulae.
Puri has given detailed account of Classical formulations such as Amrit Rasayana, Brahm Rasayana, Jawahar Mohra, Kamdugdha Ras, Laxami Vilas Ras, Laxman Vilas Ras, Madanoday Modak, Makrdhawaj vati, Manmath Ras, Mukta Panchamrit Rasayana, Nari Kalyan Pak, Navjeevan Ras, Navratna Ras, Navratnakalp Amrit, Panchamrit Ras, Paradi Ras, Ramchuramni Ras, Rattivalbh Pak, Shukar Amrit Vati, Smritisagar Ras, Suvarn Malini Vasant, Suvarn Vasant Malti, Swapanmehtank, Vasant Kusmakar Ras, Visha Rasaayana, Vrihda Vangeshwar Rasa.
These classical Rasayan formulas, contain a large number of ingredients, including minerals, pearl, coral and gems, and include a specially processed (samskara) mercury (the word "ras" indicates mercury as an ingredient).
Because of negative publicity and cost factor, the use of the classical rasayana formulas has declined considerably, and most of the preparations available now have herbal ingredients with a couple of mineral and animal products.
The non-availability and wild life protection act has made the use of musk, amber, and parts of wild-life animals nearly impossible.
The current Rasayan formulas are based on such ingredients as amla (Emblica officinalis) which, if fresh, has high content of vitamin C, Terminalia belerica, Terminalia chebula, Shilajit, Long pepper, Black pepper, Ginger, processed Guggul, Guduchi, Ashwaganda, Shatavari and similar ingredients.
Rasayan Shastr in Ancient India was much less developed than today.
Nevertheless, the use and practice of Rasayan was widespread in Ancient India, and some examples of applied rasayan include paints used in the caves of Ajanta and Ellora, Maharashtra state, the steel of "Vishnustambha" (literal meaning: the tower of Vishnu), and a processed wood sample in the Kondivade caves near the Rajmachi fort in Maharashtra.
Rasayana.
In many Indian homes, rasayana (fruit squash) juices are prepared and served as drink, desert or as accompaniment to meals.
In Tulunadu region of India, Banana and Mango Rasayana are made by mixing fruit pulp with cow's milk or coconut milk to a thick consistency.
This rasayana may be drunk as juice by diluting with water or milk.
With thick consistency it is used as accompaniment to dosa, chapati or meals.
Rasayana may also be known as "lassi".
Many believe this rasayana helps to beat the heat of Indian summers.
Rasayana is often given to devotees as "Prasadam".
In this case, it consists of thin slices of banana, milk or curd, sugar and honey.

Maharishi Vedic Approach to Health 
Maharishi Vedic Approach to Health (MVAH) (also known as Maharishi Ayurveda or Maharishi Vedic Medicine) is a form of alternative medicine founded in the mid-1980s by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, who developed the Transcendental Meditation technique (TM).
Distinct from traditional ayurveda, it emphasizes the role of consciousness, and gives importance to positive emotions.
Maharishi Ayur-Veda has been variously characterized as emerging from, and consistently reflecting, the Advaita Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy, representing the entirety of the ayurvedic tradition.
A 1991 article in the "Journal of the American Medical Association" (JAMA) found that promoters of MVAH failed to disclose financial incentives when they submitted a letter for publication and that their marketing practices were misleading.
A 2008 study published in JAMA reported that two of the 19 Maharishi Ayurveda products tested contained heavy metals.
A 1991 British case found two physicians guilty of "serious professional misconduct" for using MVAH in the unsuccessful treatment of HIV.
Theoretical basis.
Maharishi Vedic Approach to Health uses a model for understanding health and disease that is fundamentally different from that of modern medicine.
According to MVAH researcher Hari Sharma, MVAH views the body as an abstract pattern of intelligence whereas he feels modern medicine views the body as a machine.
He says that the world view of MVAH is closer to the reality described by 20th century physics, which challenged the reductionist materialist world view by finding that quantum mechanical phenomena contradict the idea of solid matter, that causality is less definite, that material existence is connected in unexpected and nonlocal ways, and that a reductionist view is untenable at the quantum level.
Sharma says that "Vedic thought discusses a unified field of pure, non-material intelligence and consciousness whose modes of vibration manifest as the material universe."
Disease results from losing connection with this underlying field of intelligence.
Components.
The approach does not use modern medicine or biology.
According to Hari Sharma, MVAH views the body as an abstract pattern of intelligence.
Proponents claim that through MVAH, the Maharishi revived the ancient Vedic system of health care.
MVAH identifies 40 approaches, each said to be based on one of the 40 branches of Vedic literature.
In "Alternative Medicine and Ethics", Stephen Barrett describes 20 components to Maharishi Ayurveda: 
The full range of the Maharishi Ayur-Veda program 'for creating healthy individuals and a disease free society' has 20 components: development of higher states of consciousness through advanced meditation techniques, use of primordial sounds, correction of the "mistake of the intellect', strengthening of the emotions, vedic structuring of language, music therapy, enlivening of the senses, pulse diagnosis, psychophysiological integration, neuromuscular integration, neurorespiratory integration, purification (to remove 'impurities due to faulty diet or behavioral patterns'), dietary measures, herbal food supplements, other herbal preparations, daily behavioral routines, prediction of future imbalances, religious ceremonies, nourishing the environment and promoting world health and peace.
Most of these cost several hundred dollars but some cost thousands and require the service of an ayurvedic practitioner.
A traditional vaidya treats patients individually, diagnosing them and then individually preparing or instructing the patient how to prepare treatments for the entire complexity of their individual symptoms, whereas Maharishi Ayur-Veda takes a mass-market approach.
Technique.
The TM technique is the main modality which proponents say improves mental health and promotes "collective health" in MVAH.
A 2007 review of meditative practices that included Transcendental Meditation concluded that the definitive health effects of meditation cannot be determined as the scientific evidence was of poor quality, though the review has been criticized for using an inappropriate method for assessing quality.
The review found that TM "had no advantage over health education to improve measures of systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure, body weight, heart rate, stress, anger, self-efficacy, cholesterol, dietary intake, and level of physical activity in hypertensive patients".
Another review did find a reduction in diastolic and systolic blood pressure in those who practiced TM compared to controls.
The review and its primary author were partially funded by Howard Settle, a proponent of TM.
Pulse diagnosis.
Practitioners utilize pulse diagnosis (known in Sanskrit as "nadi vigyan"), which they say is like "plugging into the inner intelligence of the body".
Based on "imbalances", recommendations related to herbal preparations, diet, daily and seasonal routines, exercise, and physiological purification are offered.
Proponents say that the pulse can be used to detect "imbalances at early stages when there may be no other clinical signs and when mild forms of intervention may suffice".
According to Deepak Chopra and Sharma, pulse diagnosis can detect a variety of diseases, including those unrelated to the cardiovascular system, including asthma, cancer, and diabetes.
William Jarvis, president of The National Council Against Health Fraud, described pulse diagnosis as a variety of palm reading and that Chopra refused to have pulse diagnosis tested by JAMA in a blinded protocol "on the grounds that a blinded experiment would 'eliminate the most crucial component of the experiment, which is consciousness.'"
Multimodal therapies.
MVAH health centers and spas offer a series of multimodal therapies including a purification therapy called panchakarma.
Panchakarma means "five actions", and is intended to clear impurities from the body and to balance the doṣas.
The first preparatory step is called "snehana", involving the ingestion of prescribed quantities of ghee over several days, followed by a purgative.
The actual panchakarma then begins with "abhyanga", a herbalized full-body oil massage and continues with one or more additional treatments, including "svedana", a herbalized steam bath; "shirodhara", in which warm sesame oil is poured on the forehead; "nasya", an oil massage of head, neck and shoulders combined with steam inhalation and nasal drops; and "basti", a herbal enema.
Additional therapies generally undertaken in association with panchakarma are "Maharishi Gandharva Veda" music therapy and aromatherapy.
Typical panchakarma treatments take 2 hours per day, over the course of 3 to 14 days, and are recommended several times per year as ideal, usually in conjunction with the change of seasons.
Products.
Herbal products are manufactured and distributed by several Maharishi Ayurveda companies, including: Maharishi Ayurveda Products Pvt. Ltd. (MAPPL) in New Delhi, Maharishi Ayurveda Products International (MAPI) in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and Maharishi Ayurveda Products Europe B.V., in the Netherlands.
Maharishi Ayurveda Products International (MAPI) of Colorado Springs sells more than 400 products and in 2000, was said to be the largest ayurvedic company in North America, with reported sales of $20 million in 1999.
Some ayurvedic herbal formulas are called rasayanas that use whole plants in various combinations.
Maharishi Amrit Kalash.
The original Maharishi Ayurveda product is Maharishi Amrit Kalash (MAK), a two-part ancient formula introduced by Balraj Maharishi based on classical ayurvedic texts and referred to as "nectar" and "ambrosia" or "MAK-4" and "MAK-5".
It uses a combination of dozens of different herbs and fruits.
Ingredients include herbs such as White Musali, Liquorice, Giant Potato, Aswagandha, Gum Arabic tree, Indian asparagus, caper, aloe, Curculigo orchioides, Amla, Tinospora cordifolia, simpleleaf chastetree and elephant creeper.
Heavy metals.
A 2008 study by Robert B. Saper, published in JAMA, found that one-fifth of 213 ayurvedic samples manufactured in either the U.S. or India and obtained via the Internet contained detectable levels of heavy metals such as arsenic, mercury or lead.
Two of 19 MAPI products tested, "Vital Lady" and "Worry Free" were found to have detectable levels of lead, while the others had no detectable levels of lead, mercury, or arsenic.
Ted Wallace, president of MAPI, stated that the company tests its products before and after shipment from India to the US, and that its products are examined for purity, heavy metals, residual pesticides, and biological contaminants.
Michael McGuffin, president of the American Herbal Products Association said that eliminating every trace of arsenic, mercury or lead from products would require "an entirely new food supply".
According to McGuffin, the government and professional agencies set widely different safety standards for lead, mercury and arsenic and that while most of the products in Saper's article have lead levels that exceed California's standard, only two violate the World Health Organization's standard.
A 2008 review has stated that "adverse health outcomes at blood lead levels below this threshold have been well demonstrated", and concluded that "it is increasingly acknowledged there is no threshold for the adverse consequences of lead exposure".
In 2008, a lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court against Maharishi Vedic Education Development Corporation ("MVED"), Maharishi Ayurveda Foundation and Maharishi Ayurveda Products Ltd. ("MAP Ltd").
The Plaintiff claims that she contracted lead poisoning from "Garbhapal Ras," an herbo-mineral product she purchased in India.
According to the Iowa Department of Public Health, Garbhapal Ras contained nearly 3% lead.
The product was manufactured by MAP Ltd. in India, and prescribed for her by a physician at the Maharishi Ayurveda Arogyadham clinic in Delhi.
A spokesperson said that MVED is not involved in the manufacturing, prescribing, or sale of products from the Indian clinic where the product was prescribed and purchased.
The spokesperson said that products sold in the U.S. are subject to inspection, testing, and quality control.
David Whitley, director of "Ayurveda Limited" in the United Kingdom, writes that the Maharishi Ayurveda Council of Vaidyas approves of the use of arsenic, lead, and mercury under the supervision of trained and certified vaidyas, in accordance with ancient Ayurvedic texts.
He claims that the benefits of heavy metals are increased and the side effects are minimized when used properly.
Whitley acknowledges that these compounds cannot be licensed for sale in the UK.
Maharishi Sthapatya Veda.
Maharishi Sthapatya Veda (MSV), is a system of Vedic architecture.
Maharishi Global Construction in Fairfield, Iowa designs buildings which "connect the individual intelligence of the occupant of the house to the cosmic intelligence of the universe", saying that homes with entrances facing west invite "poverty, lack of creativity and vitality" and "anxiety, depression, bad luck and even criminal tendencies".
In Maharishi Sthapatya Veda, the architect takes into account three major factors: the orientation of the structure, room placement and the proportion of the rooms, windows, doors, walls etc. and their dimensions.
Maharishi Vedic Astrology.
Maharishi Vedic Astrology (also known as Maharishi Jyotish) premises that planets influence individual health.
Jotyish is a vedanga within the field of vedic literature.
Maharishi Jyotish is premised on the ability to precisely calculate mathematically the unfolding pattern of life, and to locate the trends and tendencies of an individual life within that pattern, making it possible to determine in advance whether a difficult period was coming, and to take action in the present to amend a future difficulty.
Maharishi Jyotish asserts that the solar system has an influence on the human brain, cells and DNA.
According to the Maharishi and his successor, Tony Nader, there is a correspondence between the nine Grahas of Vedic Astrology and the structure of DNA, the brain and the structure of cells.
Each graha is associated with a gemstone: Maharishi Vedic Astrology associates the planets with the basal ganglia, thalmus and hypothalamus; the 12 Bhavas (astrological houses) with cortical areas; the 12 Rashis (zodiac signs) with the cranial nerves; and the 27 Nakshatras (lunar mansions) with groups of the brainstem.
Yagyas.
Correction of imbalances discovered through Maharishi Jyotish is possible, the Maharishi said, through the performance of "yagyas" by vedic pandits in India.
Yagyas are ceremonies designed to restore the balance between the individual and the environment.
Yagyas performed on Maha Shivaratri, (the day of Shiva), are said to enliven spiritual and material aspects of one's consciousness, and to promote progress in all areas of life; those performed on Maha Lakshmi are said to bring prosperity, growth and good fortune; while those performed on Akshaya Tritiya are said to enhance lasting success in one's activities.
Andrew Skolnick describes Maharishi Yagyas as Hindu ceremonies to appease the gods and beseech their help on behalf of afflicted followers that can cost tens of thousands of dollars, and which the patient neither takes part in nor witnesses.
He wrote that, while Chopra and Nancy Lonsdorf, medical director of the Maharishi Ayur-Veda Center in Washington, D.C. denied that they prescribed yagyas or that yagyas were part of Maharishi Ayur-Veda, Chopra's Lancaster Center did recommend yagyas for its patients, and a TM-Movement fundraising letter states that Lonsdorf prescribed an $11,500 yagya for a seriously ill patient of hers.
According to Skolnick, patients with serious illnesses often paid hundreds or thousands of dollars for gemstones prescribed by Maharishi Jyotish astrologers.
The movement's company called "Jyotish Gems" sells gemstones prescribed by Maharishi Jyotish astrologers to ward off the effects of bad influences in one's horoscope.
Nader writes that various gemstones correspond to the planets of Maharisi Jyotish, and also correspond to parts of the body.
The Maharishi described Maharishi Light Therapy with Gems (MLG) as a vedic technology.
According to Rainer Picha, Minister of Health for the Global Country of World Peace, training in the therapeutic use of gemstones is conducted at the Maharishi European Research University (MERU) in Holland.
Maharishi Vedic Vibration Technology.
According to its website, Maharishi Vedic Vibration Technology (MVVT), "utilizes a refined impulse of Vedic sound, or Vedic vibration, to enliven the inner intelligence of the body and restore proper functioning".
According to author Cynthia Ann Humes MVVT consists of the recitation of mantras from Vedic or other orthodox texts by the MVVT expert, while blowing on or touching the afflicted body part.
"Frontiers in Bioscience" published two studies online in 2001, including one by Tony Nader, the Lebanese neuro-scientist and researcher, who succeeded the Maharishi.
Sound therapy.
A form of classical Indian music called Maharishi Gandharva Veda is purported to integrate and harmonize the cycles and rhythms of the listener's body.
Gandharva Veda is an upaveda and is codified in a number of texts that came to be known collectively at Gandharva Veda, an auxiliary text attached to Sama Veda.
Mukund Lath writes that Gandharva Veda is a sacred corpus of music, derived from the still more ancient sama, a sacred Vedic form of music.
Compact discs of the music are published by the Maharishi University of Management Press.
Listening to recitation in Sanskrit from a specific branch of the vedic literature that corresponds to the appropriate area of the body as determined by a MVAH expert.
Health Centers.
According to the movement's Global Good News website, there are 23 Maharishi Vedic Health Centres in 15 countries.
In 2011, the Maharishi Ayurveda Hospital in New Delhi, India became the first ayurvedic hospital in Northern India to receive accreditation from the National Hospital Accreditation Board of Hospitals (NABH).
The Raj is a health spa in Maharishi Vedic City, Iowa.
Deepak Chopra founded the spa in 1987 and was its medical director.
Ayurvedic spas have also been established in two locations in Germany: Bad Ems in Rhineland-Palatinate, and Bissendorf in Lower Saxony.
One Maharishi Ayurveda health clinic is in Austria, soma med in .
The building of soma med in Austria is built according to Maharishi Sthapatya Veda standards.
Medical director of soma med is Dr Wolfgang Schachinger.
Training.
Courses to train physicians, nurses and health professionals in the principles and practices of Maharishi Ayurveda are offered by the Maharishi Ayur-Veda Association of America (MAAA) in various locations in the USA.
These courses include Continuing Medical Education credit.
The faculty and curriculum committee of the MAAA include: Stuart Rothenberg, Robert Schneider, Walter Moelk, Nancy Lonsdorf, Richard Averbach, Gary Kaplan, and Vaidya Manohar Palakurthi.
Courses are offered in conjunction with the Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine in La Jolla, California.
Courses in Maharishi Ayur-Veda for health professionals are also conducted at the Maharishi College of Perfect Health, International Maharishi Ayur-Veda Training Centre at MERU, Holland.
These courses include: post graduate training, Maharishi Aroma Therapy, Maharishi Light Therapy with Gems, Maharishi Ayur-Veda Health Educator, Vedic Mind-Body program and Presentation of Medical Research.
The faculty includes Rainer Picha, Walter Mölk, Robert Keith Wallace, Roswitha Margarete Geelvink-Tradel, and Bob Apon.
The Maharishi College of Vedic Medicine was located at 2721 Arizona Street, NE Albuquerque, New Mexico in the 1990s and 2000s.
There is now a campus in San Diego.
Origin of Ayurveda and its relationship to Maharishi Ayurveda.
Maharishi Ayur-Veda is described as a modern restoration of the holistic perspective of the original texts of Ayurveda found in the Vedas.
In MVAH, the Veda is said to be an "abstract blueprint of creation".
The knowledge and technologies of MVAH are based on the understanding that the order displayed throughout the entire universe, including within the human physiology, is governed by a fundamental underlying intelligence.
According to the Maharishi, illness comes about when there is a lack of coordination between the body's inner intelligence and its outer expression.
As with traditional Ayurveda, Maharishi Ayur Veda describes material creation according to panchamahābhūtas theory, in which the five elements of earth, air, fire, water and ether combine to form three doṣas: vāta, pitta and kapha.
The theory of both traditional and Maharishi Ayurveda is that the body's function is governed by the three doṣas, which designate body types and the physical and mental traits they typify.
An individual's doṣa contains various combinations of vāta, pitta and kapha, which can vary with the seasons and time of day.
Disease symptoms are attributed to imbalances in one's doṣa, which can be detected through pulse diagnosis or a questionnaire.
Balance is achieved through a variety of products and procedures, many of which are specific to one's doṣa.
Maharishi Ayur-Veda does not stray from these traditional common interpretations of doṣa.
Maharishi Ayur Veda emerges from and consistently reflects the Advaita Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy, and is the upaveda of Atharva Veda.
Maharishi Ayur Veda represents itself as representing the entirety of the Ayurvedic tradition.
The practices of Maharishi Ayur-Veda are said to be authentic, though Francis Zimmerman says that they are biased toward gentleness, avoiding violent or painful treatments that were historically part of ayurveda in early India.
He also says that Maharishi Ayur-Veda involves an ideological confusion of Ayurvedic categories.
In 1985, Maharishi Ayurveda doctors met with outside consultants, who suggested that some traditional Ayurvedic remedies would not be accepted by American consumers.
The principal difference between Maharishi Ayur-Veda and traditional Ayurveda is the emphasis on the role of consciousness and the use of Transcendental Meditation, as well as the highlighting of the need to express positive emotions and attuning one's life to the natural rhythms of the body.
Maharishi Ayur Veda also holds that perfect health is a state present within every person, that can be chosen by the individual, and that the physical body is a portal to a "quantum mechanical body" that exists at the subatomic level where matter and energy are one, and that every organ and process in the body has a quantum equivalent.
Tony Nader, called Maharajadhiraj Raja Ram, who is the Sovereign Ruler of the Global Country of World Peace, identifies this concept of "quantum healing" with the Maharishi's theories of Vedic Science.
Individual metabolic differences and seasonal variations as described in MAV are an important part of a healthy diet.
MAV considers taste and quality to be central features in the classification of foods, and seasonal factors as crucial in determining nutritional needs.
MAV also advises use of certain herbal nutritional supplements to maintain optimum health.
Deepak Chopra, founding president of Maharishi Ayur-Veda Products International, Inc (MAPI), the American Association of Ayurvedic Medicine and former medical director of the Maharishi Ayurveda Health Center for Stress Management and Behavioral Medicine, says, according to Stephen Barrett in an article in the journal "Alternative Medicine and Ethics", that "If you have happy thoughts, then you make happy molecules.
On the other hand, if you have sad thoughts, and angry thoughts, and hostile thoughts, then you make those molecules which may depress the immune system and make you more susceptible to disease."
Barrett goes on to say that, while the TM technique and other relaxation techniques may temporarily relieve stress, claims made by Chopra that happy or sad thought may affect the molecular levels of the body and the immune system have no scientific basis.
Reception.
According to the book "Global and Modern Ayurveda", while Maharishi Ayur-Veda was instrumental in the popularization of Ayurveda in the 1980s and early 1990s, its role in global Ayurveda has now been marginalized.
Authors Smith and Wujastyk attribute the virtual disappearance of MAV as an influence in global Ayurveda to the following factors: (i) isolating and describing itself as being authentic, thereby inferring that other forms of Ayurveda are "disbarred from legitimacy"; (ii) raising "its prices stratospherically" for its medicines and treatments, which placed it beyond the means of all but "the most committed and enthusiastic (and wealthy) followers"; and (iii) "become stridently opposed to allopathic medicine".
In the same volume, Suzanne Newcombe cites criticism of the commercial nature of Maharishi Ayur-Veda, but says that "Maharishi Ayur-Veda is an important part of the practice of Ayurveda in contemporary society, despite the ideological claims of those who oppose the system."
Smith and Wujastyk write that previously it was a requirement that MAV practitioners have a medical degree, but in 2005, all medical doctors with MAV training were replaced by Maharishi Ayurveda practitioners from India.
Author Philip Goldberg writes that Maharishi Ayurveda "attracted attention" due to the "TM movement's aggressive promotion".
Author Frederick M. Smith writes that in the U.K. "the Maharishi organization had a clear marketing plan and a full-time public relations officer up until at least 1992."
In 1991, journalist Andrew Skolnick wrote that the TM movement's marketing of Maharishi Ayurveda was a "widespread pattern of misinformation, deception, and manipulation of lay and scientific news media."
These were seen as efforts to gain "scientific respectability".
According to an article by Ralph Smith, a similar concern was raised in the 1980 book "TM and Cult Mania".
Chalmers and Davis.
In October 1991, the Professional Conduct Committee of the British General Medical Council found Roger Chalmers, Dean of Medicine of the unrecognized Maharishi University of Natural Law, Mentmore and Leslie Davis, Dean of Physiology at that institution, guilty of "Serious Professional Misconduct" in connection with their use of Maharishi Ayur-Veda for the treatment of AIDS and HIV, and ordered them erased from the List of Registered Medical Practitioners.
(Chalmers was subsequently reinstated.)
The Committee found, among other things, that there were no proper and approved clinical trials for the treatments, there was inadequate scientific evidence to support the treatments, that they were prescribing and that they had made false and misleading statements on the value of MAV in the treatment of HIV and AIDS and about the TM-affiliated "World Medical Association for Perfect Health".
Independent tests of the pills prescribed by Chalmers and Davis showed that they had, at best, a negligible effect on HIV, but were 100,000 times more toxic than AZT.
According to a 1990 report in "The Independent" regarding the accusations, the claim that Maharishi Ayurvedic has no side effects "appears to be inaccurate."
The article says that separate warnings had been issued in the past on side-effects of both Transcendental Meditation and the Maharishi Ayurvedic diet, such as a warning by the British Dietetic Association on the potential dangers of the Maharishi Ayurvedic diet to AIDS patients.
According to Suzanne Newcombe, alternative treatments often receive little attention in the U.K. and MAV was the focus of GMC only because the treatments involved AIDS patients, which she characterized as a vulnerable and controversial group at the time.
Sharma and Chopra.
In 1991, the "Journal of the American Medical Association" ("JAMA") published an article on the benefits of Maharishi Ayur-Veda titled "Letter from New Delhi: Maharishi Ayur-Veda: Modern Insights into Ancient Medicine," authored by Hari Sharma, then of The Ohio State University College of Medicine and now of The Ohio State University College of Medicine's Center for Integrative Medicine, Brihaspati Dev Triguna, of the All India Ayur-Veda Congress, and Deepak Chopra, of the American Association of Ayurvedic Medicine  
A subsequent article in "JAMA" by Andrew A. Skolnick alleged that the authors of the first article had not disclosed their financial ties with organizations that sell the products and services about which they wrote.
The article also investigated the marketing practices surrounding Ayur-Veda products and services.
It was alleged there was a "widespread pattern of misinformation, deception, and manipulation of lay and scientific news media".
It challenged the Sharma et al. claim that Maharishi Ayur-Veda was more cost effective than standard medical care.
Additionally, the article reported that in the late 1980s, herbal researcher Tony Nader, at the time a PhD candidate in neuroscience at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, had been criticized for misrepresenting his research promoting Maharishi Ayurveda Products International (MAPI) herbal products as being sponsored by MIT and Harvard.
The article reported that Nader and David Orme-Johnson were criticized by the organizers of the Annual Meeting of the Society for Economic Botany, which was held at the University of Illinois in Chicago in June 1987.
According to the organizers, Nader and Orme-Johnson submitted research abstracts for the conference, but the presentation that they made had little to do with the abstracts.
Instead it was a promotion for the herbal remedies of MAPI and for Transcendental Meditation.
The "JAMA" article quotes a former TM teacher and chair of the TM center in Washington, D.C., as saying that he had been told to deceive the media.
A letter to the editor by Chopra and Sharma was published in "JAMA" in October 1991.
Chopra and Sharma wrote that many of the criticisms they had received in letters to the editor were inflammatory and had depended heavily on emotional and unfounded charges, without sound scientific backing and few references.
They went on to say that the criticisms were directed largely at the TM organization, rather than to the approaches of Maharishi Ayur-Veda.
Andrew Skolnick, in a letter to the editor of "JAMA", says Chopra and Sharma did not deny and made no apology that they had concealed from "JAMA" their financial ties to organizations selling and marketing the products and services about which they wrote, and claimed to have no such conflicts of interest on their signed author's form.
Skolnick later published an account of how "JAMA" was deceived.
The journal "Science" summarized the issue as "an ugly episode that has implications for all scientific journals and for scientists who could possibly be construed as having a conflict of interest".
In response, two TM organizations then headed by Deepak Chopra sued Skolnick, "JAMA" editor George Lundberg, and the AMA in 1992, seeking an injunction and $194 million in damages.
The suit alleged Skolnick's news report on TM's health care products and services was libelous and that it tortuously interfered with their business interests.
In August 1992, in a noted decision, the trial court rejected the plaintiff's motion to enjoin "JAMA" and Skolnick under the Illinois Deceptive Practices Act from publishing statements about them and Maharishi Ayurveda, observing that the plaintiffs did not allege that the statements about them had been false or misleading, and holding that "plaintiffs have little likelihood of prevailing on the merits of their disparagement claim", and that "JAMA" and Skolnick's alleged defamatory statements were protected as "fair comment and criticism" on an issue of public concern.
Shortly thereafter, the case was dismissed without prejudice in March 1993.
In 1997, "Newsweek" reported that according to Chopra's lawyer the suit was "settled for an undisclosed amount."
"Newsweek" later published a correction and clarified that there was no monetary settlement.
Philip Goldberg's 2010 book "American Veda" says that the lawsuit was settled in 1993.
Flint.
In 1994, Jonie Flint sued Chopra, the Maharishi Ayur-Veda Health Center in Palo Alto California and Brihaspati Dev Triguna over her husband David's death from leukemia.
Two months following a visit to the center at which a primordial sound treatment was prescribed by Chopra, Triguna declared Flint cured of leukemia.
Flint followed other Maharishi Ayur-Veda treatments at Triguna's directions over a period of nine months, at a cost of more than $10,000, but died of leukemia.
Flint was assisted in filing her lawsuit by the National Council Against Health Fraud.
Chopra's attorneys said that the suit against him would be dismissed before trial.
They said that David Flint was desperate and that Chopra saw him for 45 minutes for spiritual counsel and gave him a primordial sound technique.
They also said that Flint signed a form saying that he understood that sound therapy wasn't a substitute for conventional therapies, and that the form Flint signed also absolved Chopra and his organization of responsibility in the event the treatment was unsuccessful.

Malas (Ayurveda) 
Malas ( ) in Ayurveda, the waste products of the body.
The malas are grouped as "TRIMALA"(Three Waste products) which include urine, stool, and sweat as the basic principal malas.
In Ayurveda the excreta of eyes, ears, nose; tears; nails; hair are also included in the mala.
Effective elimination of malas is said to be important for maintaining good health.
It is one of the pillars that constitute to the basic structure &amp; functioning of the body.
Samskara (ayurvedic) 
A samskara is a process in ayurvedic medicine said to detoxify heavy metals and toxic herbs.
In ayurveda, toxic ingredients, which sometimes include heavy metals such as mercury, are claimed to be purified using a process of prayer and pharmacy.
There is little evidence that this process is generally effective, and case reports describe adverse effects of taking these substances.
Metals, minerals or gems if added to herbs contain toxic heavy metals such as lead, mercury and arsenic.
Adverse reactions to herbs due to their pharmacology are described in traditional ayurvedic texts, but ayurvedic practitioners are reluctant to admit that herbs could be toxic and the reliable information on herbal toxicity is not readily available.
A 2004 study found such toxic metals in 20% of ayurvedic preparations that were made in South Asia for sale around Boston and extrapolated the data to the United States more broadly.
It concluded that excess consumption of these products could cause health risks.
A 2008 study of more than 230 products found that approximately 20% of remedies (and 40% of "rasa shastra" medicines) purchased over the Internet from both US and Indian suppliers contained lead, mercury or arsenic.
Following concerns about metal toxicity, the Government of India ruled that ayurvedic products must specify their metallic content directly on the labels of the product; however, M. S. Valiathan noted that "the absence of post-market surveillance and the paucity of test laboratory facilities [in India] make the quality control of Ayurvedic medicines exceedingly difficult at this time.
Svedana 
Svedana or Swedana, means to "perspire".
It is used in Ayurvedic treatment.
It is also called as steam therapy.
There are different types of swedana.
Sitting in sun is also called as swedana.
Swedana is a pre procedure for Panchakarma.
Snehana and Swedana are pre procedures for Panchakarma.
An herbal combination is sometimes added to the steam for medicinal effect.
Abhyanga 
Abhyanga ("oil massage") is a form of Ayurvedic therapy that involves massage of the entire body from the head to the toe with Dosha-specific warm herb-infused oil.
The oil is commonly pre-mixed with herbs for specific conditions.
Traditionally, the base oil used is sesame but, Ayurveda Professionals base the oil section on the Dosha type and hence herb oils like Ashwagandha oil, Mahanarayan oil, Bhringaraj oil, Brahmi oil and Neem oil can be used and in some cases to correct Kapha Dosha Almond Oil or corn oil might also be used.
The Abhyanga is a part of the Dinacharya (daily practices) specified by the Brhat Trayi and Laghutrayi series of Ayurvedic textbooks to maintain good health and well-being.
Proponents claim Abhyanga aids joint health, nourishes the Dhatus (body tissues) and brings aggravated Doshas back to balance.
They further claim it improves the condition of dry, coarse hair and flaky skin.
Abhyanga can be done as part of the steps of Panchakarma therapy, especially in the first stage: Purva Karma (pre-treatment), or as its own therapy.
It is often followed by Svedana therapy or a warm bath.
Abhyanga may be performed by one or more therapists working in sync, but it can also be done by oneself.
Oils used can vary depending on the season and the individual's out-of-balance constitution (Vkrtti).
The Abhyanga as prescribed in the Brhat Trayi and Laghutrayee texts is vigorous, and intended to open up the minor Srotas, remove Ama (toxins) through the skin, melt Kleshma (fat secretions blocking the Srotas), and cleanse and moisturize the skin.
Abhyanga can also be used to soothe Vata, Pitta and Kapha Dosha imbalances which will bring deep relaxation to the body and a peaceful mind.
In order to correct a specific Dosha imbalance, a Dosha specific base and herb oil concoction may be used.
Dhātu (Ayurveda) 
Dhātus (dhä·tōōs), n.pl. ( from Sanskrit धातु dhātu - layer, stratum, constituent part, ingredient, element, primitive matter ) in Ayurveda, the seven fundamental principles (elements) that support the basic structure (and functioning) of the body.
They consist of: 
Traditional texts often refer to these as the Seven Dhātus (Saptadhātus).
Ojas, meaning vigour or vitality, is known as the eighth Dhātu, or Mahādhātu (superior, or great dhātu).

Dinacharya 
Dinacharya (Sanskrit: दिनचर्या "daily-routine") is a concept in Ayurvedic medicine that looks at the cycles of nature and bases daily activities around these cycles.
Ayurveda contends that routines help establish balance and that understanding daily cycles is useful for promoting health.
Dinacharya says that each day, two cycles of change occur, that correlate with the Ayurvedic concept of dosha.
Routines covered by dinacharya include: waking time, elimination, hygiene, massage, exercise, bathing, meditation and prayer, meals, study, work, relaxation and sleeping.
Agnivesha 
Agnivesha () is a legendary rishi (sage) in Hinduism, reputedly one of the earliest authors on Ayurveda (Indian alternative medicine).
He is described to have codified the knowledge of his preceptor, Atreya, and arranged it in the form of a treatise, named the Charaka Samhita.
Legend.
Agnivesha is described to be the chief pupil of Punarvasu Atreya.
The "Agnivesha Samhita", dated back to 1500 BCE, is based on Atreya's teachings, and is a lost text on Ayurveda.
The Agniveśatantra, consisting of 12,000 verses, is stated to be the foundational text of the Agnivesha school, one of the six schools of early Ayurveda (others being Parashara, Harita, Bhela, Jatukarna, and Ksharpani).
The text is mentioned in the Charaka Samhita: "the tantra (Agnivesha) as written by Agnivesha is compiled, edited and modified by Charaka" ()  
Sura (alcoholic drink) 
Sura or Sooraa (Sanskrit and Pāli; Devanāgarī: ) is a strong distilled alcoholic drink originating from the Indian subcontinent.
It is referred to as an anaesthetic by Suśruta (a surgeon in India circa 400 BCE).
Other ancient medical authorities also mention it; Charaka referred to making a woman with a miscarriage senseless to pain by administering alcoholic drinks like "sooraa", "sīdhu", "ariṣṭa", "madhu", "madirā" or "āsava".
History.
The method for preparation appears in the Atharvaveda in the Kandas 5 and 8.
In Buddhist texts "surāh" is mentioned as one of intoxicating drinks, along with (Pali) "meraya" (Sanskrit "maireya", a drink made with sugar cane and several spices) and "majja" (maybe equivalent of Sanskrit "madhu", mead or hydromel), and renunciation of its usage constitutes the 5th of the Buddhist precepts (pañca-sīlāni): "I undertake the training rule to abstain from fermented drinks which cause heedlessness" ("Surāmerayamajjapamādaṭṭhānā veramaṇī sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi").
Ritucharya 
Kashayam 
Kashayam (Sanskrit: "kaṣāyaṁ") is a Ayurveda and does not denote any one particular Ayurvedic medicine, but a generic term for various types of medicinal concoction in Ayurveda.
Kashayam refers to a water decoction or water extract of a single herb or group of herbs and can be used for ailments like indigestion, cough and common cold etc.
It is an ancient form of medicine that has been used for a long time.
Many are very bitter in taste and the liquid is dark in color.
It is mainly used by Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu , Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and West Bengal states.
It is also called "Kwath" or "Kadha" in other cultures in India.
Ingredients.
Many readily used kitchen spices and herbs like tulsi, ginger, neem leaves, cinnamon, cloves, long pepper and pepper etc. are used in preparing kashayam. people also use cumin seeds for digestion issues, carom seeds for cough  
Poomulli 
Poomulli () is a Namboothiri family whose origins go back over 900 years.
Poomulli's name has been closely associated with the culture and heritage of Kerala.
Early history.
The Poomulli Mana was a Namboothiri family residing in Ūrakam of the Peruvanam village about 900 years ago.
They built the original Ammathiruvadi Temple, left all that they owned to the temple, and gave the temple administration to the Kingdom of Kochi.
Then they left the village and resettled themselves in Peringode of the present-day Palakkad,nearby Ottappalam.
In folklore.
Legend has it that Namboothiri (while in the Peruvanam village) went to Kanchipuram to visit the Kamakshi Amman Temple.
Happy with the devotion of the Namboothiri, Kanchi Kamakshi decided to come to Kerala on his palm-leaf umbrella.
He reached home, and placed the umbrella on the floor of his house.
When he came back later he was unable to take back the umbrella.
It was heavily grounded to the floor.
Later upon further investigation, it was revealed that Kanchi Kamakshi was residing on that umbrella.
The goddess came into Namboothiri’s dreams that night and let him know that he was supposed to build a temple for the goddess, and leave Ūrakam.
She also let him know that he was to find an idol in a well far away and he was to transfer the goddess from the umbrella onto that idol.
Namboothiri did as the goddess wished, and he built the temple and left all that he owned to the temple.
Later history.
Poomulli Mana later grew to be one of the richest and most powerful Namboothiri families of Kerala and one of the biggest landlords of Malabar.
The head of the family used to be invited to all the important functions in the court of the Samoothirippad of Kozhikode, and the Maharajas of Thiruvithaamkoor.
The family was well known for their hospitality and considered Anna-Danam as their dharma.
The Poomulli family was involved in encouraging the arts and sciences.
The members of Poomully Mana were practitioners and experts in Ayurveda, Rig-veda, Yoga, Kalari (martial art)Music &amp; other cultural arts.
Late.Sri.Poomully Narayanan Namboodirippad (father of Aramthampuran &amp; Rig-veda practitioner), Late.Sri. Poomully Raman Namboothiripad, student of the musician Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavatar and Late.Sri. Poomulli Neelakandan Namboothiripad (Aramthampuran) the Ayurveda practitioner, are better known among them.
Still, other personalities from within the country and abroad visit Poomully mana for Ayurveda treatments and for practice in arts &amp; cultural form.

Maya Tiwari 
Maya Tiwari (born April 16, 1952, in Liverpool Village, Guyana) is a humanitarian, world peace leader and author.
Also called "Mother Maya", she is an international teacher of Ayurveda, a health activist and the founder of the Wise Earth School of Ayurveda and Mother Om Mission.
Biography.
Maya Tiwari was born in Guyana, the daughter of Brahmin priest Pandit Bhagawan Ramprasad Tiwari, whose family originated from Lucknow, India.
Thereafter, she became a fashion designer in New York City at the age of 18.
Her fashion and "Maya" boutique was a prominent store at 773 Madison Avenue, New York City where she served clientele like Jackie Onassis, Princess Diana, Nureyev, and Patti La Belle among other celebrities.
Her designs were featured in stores such as Bergdorf Goodman, Henri Bendel's, and Saks Fifth Avenue to Harrods in the UK.
In 1981, Maya established the Wise Earth School of Ayurveda, the first school for Ayurveda studies in North America, based on the knowledge of the Greater Vedas.
On Mother's Day in 1998, Tiwari founded the Mother Om Mission (MOM), a nonprofit organization that provides Ayurveda education and services to at-risk communities in New York's inner cities and Guyana.
In December 2009, Tiwari was a featured speaker at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Melbourne, Australia.
In 2010 Maya Tiwari renounced her monastic title and spiritual honorific—Her Holiness, Sri Swami Mayatitananda—to, as she puts it, “walk a simpler and more accessible life in service of the populations in need."
In October 2016, Maya Tiwari was the opening guest on the radio show 'Unlock Your Health', where in she recorded a series of four interviews on her cancer healing journey.
The Peace Mandala.
Among the healing programs developed by Tiwari is The Peace Mandala, a program in which she leads hundreds of people worldwide in the creation of Peace Mandalas created from seeds and grains "to help generate inner harmony by reconnecting to nature's seed memory of wellness and love."
The purpose of The Peace Mandalas is "to re-enliven humanity's memory of inner harmony and the awareness necessary to cooperate with and celebrate Mother Earth's profound gifts to humanity.
Living Ahimsa brings awareness to the preservation of the seed-memory of nature, human sentiency and the integrity of Mother Earth."
She appeared at Deepak Chopra's "Seduction of Spirit" meditation event in Toronto, Canada in August 2014 where she led the attendees through the creation of making a Peace Mandala.
The Living Ahimsa World Peace Tour and Oath.
In December 2009, at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Melbourne, Australia, Tiwari began The Living Ahimsa World Peace Tour and has traveled to several countries, leading people in taking an oath of ahimsa, which means non-harm or peace.
(Mahatma Gandhi is a key world figure who promoted ahimsa as a vehicle for creating change.)
The Living Ahimsa Peace Tour's aim is "teaching the cultivation of harmony and nonviolence in thought, speech, and action, with the purpose of healing individuals and safeguarding Mother Earth and the world."
Tiwari states, 'The world can't engender peace until we as individuals . . . discover the state of inner harmony within us.'
As of September 2014, Maya Tiwari has been on The Living Ahimsa World Peace Tour for six years. 154,665 people have taken the oath.
Hinduism Today writes, "The Living Ahimsa Vrata mission makes the spirit of nonviolence a palpable reality for individuals [...]
The vow can be taken in person or online.
Central to the vow is a thirty-minute meditation twice a day.
Aum is chanted 108 times, two times, followed by contemplation on key Hindu Vedic verses."
Tiwari's Inner Medicine Healing principle informs the curricula of Wise Earth Ayurveda education.
Tiwari says that "Inner Medicine Healing is based on the concept that each one of us has the ability to heal ourselves."
A key part of her teachings is The Cosmic Memory Principle, which refers to achieving healing through the collective timeless memories of all species and life forms in the universe.

Pulse diagnosis 
Pulse diagnosis is a diagnostic technique used in Ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicine, traditional Mongolian medicine, Siddha medicine, traditional Tibetan medicine, and Unani.
Although it once showed many positive results, it no longer has scientific legitimacy, but research continues and is ill-defined in some derived text, and is subjective.
Traditional Indian medicine (Ayurveda and Siddha-Veda).
In Ayurveda, advocates claim that by taking a pulse examination, imbalances in the three Doshas (Vata, Pitta, and Kapha) can be diagnosed.
The ayurvedic pulse also claims to determine the balance of prana, tejas, and ojas.
Ayurvedic pulse measurement is done by placing index, middle and ring finger on the wrist.
The index finger is placed below the wrist bone on the thumb side of the hand (radial styloid).
This index finger represents the Vata dosha.
The middle finger and ring finger are placed next to the index finger and represents consequently the Pitta and Kapha doshas of the patient.
Pulse can be measured in the superficial, middle, and deep levels thus obtaining more information regarding energy imbalance of the patient.
Traditional Chinese medicine.
The main sites for pulse assessment are the radial arteries in the left and right wrists, where it overlays the styloid process of the radius, between the wrist crease and extending proximal, approximately 5 cm in length (or 1.9 cun, where the forearm is 12 cun).
In traditional Chinese medicine, the pulse is divided into three positions on each wrist.
The first pulse closest to the wrist is the "cun" (inch, 寸) position, the second "guan" (gate, 關), and the third pulse position furthest away from the wrist is the "chi" (foot, 尺).
There are several systems of diagnostic interpretation of pulse findings utilised in the Chinese medicine system.
Some systems (Cun Kou) utilise overall pulse qualities, looking at changes in the assessed parameters of the pulse to derive one of the traditional 29 pulse types.
The traditional 29 pulse types include Floating, Soggy, Empty, Leathery, Scattered, Hollow, Deep, Firm, Hidden, Long, Surging, Short, Rapid, Hasty, Hurried, Moderate, Slow, Knotted, Full, Thready, Minute, Slippery, Choppy, Wiry, Tight, Weak, Regularly intermittent, rapid-irregular, and Stirred.
They are analyzed based on several factors, including depth, speed, length, and fluid level.
Some pulses are a combination of more than one factor.
Other approaches focus on individual pulse positions, looking at changes in the pulse quality and strength within the position, with each position having an association with a particular body area.
For example, each of the paired pulse positions can represent the upper, middle and lower cavities of the torso, or are associated individually with specific organs.
(For example, the small intestine is said to be reflected in the pulse at the left superficial position, and the heart at the deep position.)
Various classic texts cite different arrangements to the pairings of organs, some omitting the second organ from the pulse entirely while others show organ systems reflecting the acupuncture channels (five phase pulse associations), and another the physical organ arrangement used in Chinese herbal medicine diagnosis (Li Shi Zhen).
Generally, the commonly used organ associations are: first position on the left hand represents the heart and small intestine, the second, liver and gallbladder, and third the kidney "yin" and the bladder.
On the right hand, the first position is representative of the lungs and large intestine, the second of the spleen and stomach, and the third represents the kidney "yang" and uterus or triple burner.
The strengths and weaknesses of the positions are assessed at 3 depths each, namely "fu" (floating, 浮), "zhong" (middle, 中) and "chen" (deep, 沉).
These 9 positions are used to assess the patient diagnostically, along with the different qualities and speed of the pulse.
In ancient Islamic medicine.
Pulse diagnosis, or pulsology, was part of medicine in the medieval Islamic world.
The Canon of Medicine, published in 1025, included instructions on how to analyse the pulse and from such examination, physicians considered that they could identify problems ranging from jaundice to dropsy, diphtheria, pregnancy, and anxiety.
Pancha Bhuta 
Pancha Bhuta or Pancha Maha-Bhuta (, ; ), five great elements, also five physical elements, is a group of five basic elements, which, according to Hinduism, is the basis of all cosmic creation.
These elements are: "Prithvi/Bhudevi" (Sanskrit: पृथ्वी:, Earth), "Apas/Varuna/Jala" (Sanskrit: आपः, Water), "Agni" (Sanskrit: अग्नि, Fire), "Vayu" (Sanskrit: वायु:, Air), "Akasha/Dyaus" (Sanskrit: आकाश, Space/Atmosphere/Ether).
These elements have different characteristics and these also account for different faculties of human experience.
In "ayurveda" and Indian philosophy, the human body is considered to be made of these five elements.
However, Cārvāka did not accept "Akasha" as basic element as it is not tangible and according to them, there are only four basic elements.
Hinduism influenced Buddhism, which accepts only four Mahābhūtas, viewing "Akasha" as a derived (upādā) element.
These five elements of Indian cosmological system are similar but not identical to five element theory used in East Asia.
Description.
The "Pancha Bhuta" are the basic elements that make up any living organism on Earth or anywhere else in the Universe.
Below table gives a reference on what component of the human body is associated with these elements.
Each of the five finger in human beings is also associated with a particular element, so this means the energy associated with the appropriate element can be channelized through various hand mudras.
Ayurveda.
According to ayurveda and Yoga, "Pancha Bhuta" are associated with overall health of human being.
Any disorder in human body indicates imbalance of one or more of these elements.
"Yoga Tattva Mudra Vijnana" relates these five elements to five fingers of human being.
Different "Mudra" were developed to balance these in human body which form the "Hasta Mudra" in yogic tradition and are used in naturopathy.
The three "dosha"- three intrinsic tendencies, which, according to ayurveda are intrinsic in every human being, are representation of combination of these five elements in human body.
The three "dosha" have subtle positive essences which control the mind and body function.
Yogic view.
According to "Yoga", the aim of "sadhana" is to have mastery over oneself.
This mastery can be achieved by mastering all the basic elements.
The process of gaining mastery over these elements and purifying them is called "Bhuta Shuddhi".
"Pancha Bhuta Stalam" is representation of "Pancha Bhuta" for yogic practice.
People used to move from one temple 
to another and do "sadhana" on particular basic element.
The seven "Chakras" in the human subtle body are associated with these five elements.
Hasta Mudras.
"Hasta Mudra" or hand posture is based on the "panch Bhutas".
The basic assumption is that all the five elements can be represented by five different fingers in human body as shown in the table below.
Vastu.
Vastu shastra emphasizes on the placement of five elements in specified direction and the balance of these elements determines the condition of the associated structure.
These correlations are used to define an ideal home: The house itself is placed so that maximum load and weight is in the southwest area of the plot.
Thus, there is maximum open space in the north and east sides of the plot, satisfying Vayu/air and Akasha/aether.
The main gate, the verandah and the main door are in the northeast of the house; south of the verandah the main living room, and south of that one or two bedrooms.
The kitchen is placed in the southeast corner of the house, to balance Akasha and Agni.
Taste.
Pancha Bhuta is associated with six human tastes/Rasas as below.
Vaidya 
Vaidya (Sanskrit: ), or vaid is a Sanskrit word meaning "traditional practitioner of Ayurveda", an indigenous Indian system of alternative medicine.
Senior practitioners or teachers were called "Vaidyarāja" ("physician-king") as a mark of respect.
Some practitioners who had complete knowledge of the texts and were excellent at their practices were known as "Pranaacharya".
Some royal families in India had a personal "vaidya" in attendance and these people were referred to as "Rāja Vaidya" ("the king's physician").
In Maharashtra, like many other last names, the last name "Vaidya" is linked to the profession that the family followed.
Vaidya as a surname.
As a last name in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala, Vaidya is usually found in several communities like the Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu, Billava as well as Sonar (goldsmith).
Medimix 
Medimix is an Indian brand of ayurvedic/herbal soap manufactured and marketed by AVA Cholayil Private Limited and Cholayil Private Limited, a Chennai-based company.
The brand was founded by Dr. V. P. Sidhan from Valapad, Thrissur, Kerala.
In 1969 Dr. Sidhan combined a recipe 18 herbs to make a skin care soap.
Medimix is currently available in four types of soap, three of body wash, five facial cleansers and hygiene products like hand wash and sanitizers.
In 2011, Medimix was judged the 87th-most trusted brand in India and the 15th-most trusted brand in the personal care category according to the Brand Equity Survey conducted by the "Economic Times".
Medimix has grown synonymous with ‘skin care, the natural way’ and for generations women, indeed entire families, have placed their trust on the Medimix range of products.
Currently available in eight variants of ayurvedic soap, six variants of Herbal body wash, six variants in the face wash, herbal hand wash, ayurvedic hair shampoo &amp; conditioner, and a few other products, Medimix is expanding its range and bringing natural skin care to more people across the world.
Ashtavaidya 
An Ashtavaidya is a practitioner of the Ayurveda system of medicine belonging to a group of families of Namboothiri in the Indian state of Kerala.
Among the Ayurvedic healers of Kerala, the Ashtavaidyas are the physicians who are masters of the eight branches of Ayurveda mentioned in classical texts.
It was this expertise in the eight branches ("ashtanga"s in sanskrit) that earned them the epithet of ashtavaidya.
These branches are dealt with in detail in the treatise Ashtānga Hridayam one of the primary texts of Ayurveda.
The eight branches of Ayurveda are "Kaya" (general medicine mainly dealing with digestive disorders), "Bala" (pediatrics including obstetrics), "Graha" (psychological disorders due to possession by evil spirits), "Urdhvanga" (diseases of the head (eyes, ears, nose, throat and teeth)), "Shalya" (surgery and treatment for external injuries), "Damshtra" (toxicology (treatment for poisoning, snake and insect bites), "Jara" (geriatrics and rejuvenation) and "Vrisha" (aphrodisiacs and treatment for sterility).
Initially there were eighteen families that were designated as families of Ashtavaidyas.
Many of these families became extinct or got merged with other families and currently there are only eight surviving families considered as families of ashtavaidyas.
These families are 
Contributions to literature on Ayurveda.
The Ashtavaidyas have made several significant contributions to the literature on Ayurveda.
These include commentaries on the Ashtangahrdayam and compendiums in Malayalam such as Alattur Manipravalam, Cikitsamanjari, Sahasrayogam and Sindhuramanjari.
A member of the Vayaskara Mooss family has published ancient texts and his own original works.
Vaidyamadham Cheriya Narayan Namboodiri (1932-2013) has written books and over a hundred newspaper articles to inform the public about Ayurveda.
The training of Ashtavaidyas.
In the pre-modern times the Ashtavaidyas were trained in the traditional Gurukula system.
This involved a long period of intense study and apprenticeship under accomplished masters.
Knowledge of Sanskrit was considered essential to understand and analyse the meanings in the ancient medical texts.
Students also mastered Sanskrit works on Tarka (the rules of reasoning and argument), and the traditional philosophies of Nyaya, Vaisheshika and Samkhya.
The Ayurvedic studies of Ashtavaidyas began with the study of Ashtangahrdayam; this involved memorizing all 7120 verses of the Ashtangahrdayam.
During the period of apprenticeship under a guru, student physicians wrote out the prescription for patients.
The number of years of education was said to be “five years of textual study, five years of learning about medicinal plants in the forest, and five years of apprenticeship at home”, in practice the period of study would be much longer.
Shodhana 
In Rasa Shastra (the branch that deals with pharmaceutical processing of Ayurveda formulations), Shodhana is a process that is employed during the pharmaceutical processing either to detoxify, purify, or to potentiate the efficacy of the raw materials (of herbal, mineral, metal or animal origin).
Shodhana is of two types in Rasashastra.
Samanya or general purification method and Vishesha shodhana or the Specific methods of purification.
Jeronis de Soysa 
Gate Mudaliyar Jeronis de Soysa (19 April 1797 – 28 May 1862) was a pioneering Ceylonese entrepreneur and philanthropist.
He was a pioneer coffee planter and an industrialist who became the wealthiest Ceylonese of the 19th century by establishing the largest native commercial enterprise of the era.
He was instrumental in the establishment of the first Ceylonese bank and is often referred to as a father of private enterprise in British Ceylon.
He was the first Mudaliyar to be elevated in recognition of his philanthropy.
Early life.
Jeronis de Soysa was born on 19 April 1797 at Moratuwa.
He was the second son of Warusahennadige Joseph Soysa (Jose Rala), an Ayurveda practitioner and Kurukulasuriya Senadige Francisca Peiris.
He had seven brothers and three sisters and was affectionately known as "Babaseñor".
Both his father and grandfather Bastian Soysa and earlier ancestors; Don Francisco, Juan and Manual Soysa Muhandiram were salt and grain merchants having interests in the transportation, boat building and the agricultural sectors.
Their ancestor was the lay custodian of the Devinuwara Temple, Matara at the time of its destruction by the Portuguese in 1587.
De Soysa's parents originally wanted him to become a Buddhist monk and sent him to the Palliyagodella Temple Rawatawatta Moratuwa for studies.
He excelled in the Ayurvedic system of medicine, the Sinhala language and Astrology.
He became an Ayurvedic practitioner and possessed a charming personality.
De Soysa married Francesca Coorey, daughter of Mututantrige Bastian Cooray and Kurukulasuriya Senadige Justina Pieris in 1833.
Mututantrige Sebastian Coorey, an ancestor of Francesca had built the Rawatawatte Dutch Chapel in 1675.
Trade and Industry.
De Soysa inherited a small fortune from his uncles Daniel Peiris and Hendrick Peiris III, who were ship owners with "Yatra" building yards at Oruwella, Panadura and Grandpass, Colombo.
He invested this in expanding the trading network between the Maritime and Kandyan Provinces with the assistance of his brothers.
In 1820 he established himself as a general merchant in Kandy, becoming one of the first Sinhalese to do so.
He introduced cart transportation between the seaports and the plantations which had till then been carried out on foot and was able to dominate the industry till the building of the railway.
Meanwhile, de Soysa also became famous as Babasingha Vedamahatmaya, a sought-after Ayurvedic physician in Kandy and was reputed to have saved the lives of numerous plantation Tamils.
De Soysa's business prospered and he received several government supply contracts, including one that involved in the construction of the Colombo-Kandy road.
These investments enabled him to accumulate the large capital necessary to rent the franchising for the supply of arrack.
Later, he curtailed his investment in the distillery and tavern industry.
In 1836 de Soysa bid for the Diyatalawa kanda 'Kings Garden-Rajmal Uyana' in Hanguranketa (against British planters such as George Bird) at the request of the administrative officer of the region that had been appointed by king Sri Vikrama Rajasinha.
This was an overgrown coffee (flower) estate previously used by the Kandyan kings as a country retreat.
He also purchased many of the cinnamon estates that were previously owned by the Dutch administration in Moratuwa, Ratmalana, Dambuwa and Katunayake, citronella plantations in Ahangama and coconut plantations throughout the island.
His land holdings in Colombo consisted of several estates that stretched between Galle Face and Panadura.
The De Soysa and Peiris family established the first Ceylonese-owned bank, the Bank of Kandy at Dalada Weediya and Pettah, Colombo in 1839 &amp; 1860, at a time when European owned banks were reluctant to extend credit to the Ceylonese and the high interest rates of the Nattukkottai Chettiars.
De Soysa was also reputed for his treatment of employees and had relied to a greater extent on the low country population.
He played a significant role in improving agriculture and the infrastructure in the Kandyan province and the coastal districts.
Philanthropy.
Agriculture and infrastructure.
De Soya's agricultural properties in the up-country were mostly in the Hanguranketa, Haragama and Talatuoya areas which were then thick jungle with no roads.
He took the lead and with an improvised measuring stick demarcated the areas to be cleared for road and tank building.
He had a network of roads built and supplemented the village infrastructure by building reservoirs for irrigating paddy fields and chena cultivations.
The large scale road building projects of de Soysa include the road from Mailapitiya to Hanguranketa and Haragama and the road from Haragama to Kolongaha and Maha Oya in the Central Province.
He also had the Polgasowita-Mattegoda-Delgahakanda roads of Salpiti Korale constructed.
In 1839 he constructed the road from Galle road to Kospalankissa and several roads in Chilaw district.
The roads from Telawela to Katubedda and Mampe, the Angulana road to Kuda-Kalapuwa and the Uyana road were also constructed in the Western Province.
De Soysa was also an avid builder of tanks and reservoirs.
In 1848 he rebuilt the ancient Malulla tank (Maloluwawe) at Hanguranketa.
The Gonagama, Talatuoya, Naranvila, Kandewela and Gonawatte tanks and dams of the Central Province and the Moratuwa-Ratmalana tank in his home town are noteworthy.
He also facilitated irrigation works at Kandewela and gifted land to the poor residents of Gonagama and Hanguranketa for cultivation.
De Soysa also built the Tibotuwawewatte Ambalama in Haragama and the sprawling rest house and gardens at Moratuwa for public use.
As a result of the medical and financial assistance given to the landslide victims of Kadugannawa, de Soysa's caravans were safeguarded by Saradiel, the Robin Hood of Ceylon.
De Soysa had also met Puran Appu, a hero of the Matale Rebellion, who had on occasion disguised himself as a carter in spying missions to Kandy.
Religious and educational work.
On his land stood the ancient temple; Pothgul Viharaya of Hanguranketa, which was in a state of collapse.
After rebuilding and renovating the temple he nominated the Ven. Attadassi Thero as its Chief Incumbent and gifted the surrounding lands to the Temple.
De Soysa also built a Chaitya in Moratuwa to enshrine the ashes of his teacher Ven. Meddegama Thero.
He built and financed a free primary school and facilitated an Oriental Library in Hanguranketa.
He empowered the traditional Gam Sabhas, established a Legal Aid Society, a library and an association for social reform (Sadarana Sarana Samagama) in Moratuwa.
Towards the end of his life, de Soysa embraced Christianity in appreciation of the blessings and recognition that had been bestowed on him.
To commemorate this event the Mudaliyar decided to build the Holy Emmanuel Church.
On 27 December 1857, Bishop James Chapman laid the cornerstone of the church, designed by Thomas Skinner.
On 27 December 1860, the Holy Emmanuel Church was consecrated by Dr. James Chapman, the first Bishop of Colombo and the event was attended by the Governor Charles Justin MacCarthy.
His brother Mudaliyer Susew de Soysa (1809-1881) gifted an estate opposite the Mount Lavinia Hotel for its maintenance and a part of it was later transferred to relocate S. Thomas' College.
Death.
Jeronis de Soysa Dharmagunawardane Vipulajayasuriya Karunaratne Dissanayake died at the age of 65 on 28 May 1862.
He was buried in the Holy Emmanuel Church, engraved as per his wishes using the Sinhala script.
Legacy.
De Soysa, often referred to as a father of private enterprise was the pioneer native entrepreneur, philanthropist and social reformer who played the role of a path-finder.
He died, leaving Charles de Soysa, aged 26, entrusted with the management of an estate worth millions.
His infrastructure and tank building projects were commendable, considering the fact that it came after the abolition of the traditional "rajakriya" system of free compulsory labour and the devastation caused following the Kandyan convention.
In 1853, de Soysa was appointed Gate Mudaliyar by the Governor George William Anderson.
He was the first native headman to be appointed for public benefactions as opposed to government service.
Polyherbal formulation 
Polyherbal formulation (PHF) is the use of more than one herb in a medicinal preparation.
The concept is found in Ayurvedic and other traditional medicinal systems where multiple herbs in a particular ratio may be used in the treatment of illness.
It is used in these systems for the treatment of many diseases, including diabetes.
Historically, the Ayurvedic literature “Sarangdhar Samhita” dated centuries ago in 1300 A. D. has highlighted the concept of polyherbalism in this ancient medicinal system.
In the traditional system of Indian medicine, plant formulations and combined extracts of plants are chosen rather than individual ones.
It is known that Ayurvedic herbals are prepared in a number of dosage forms, in which mostly all of them are PHF.
Due to synergism, polyherbalism confers some benefits which is not available in single herbal formulation.
Oil pulling 
Oil pulling is an alternative medical practice in which an edible oil is swished around the mouth for a period of time and then spat out, similar to mouthwash.
It originates from Ayurvedic medicine.
Practitioners of oil pulling claim it is capable of improving oral and whole-body health.
Its promoters claim it works by "pulling" out toxins, but there is no credible evidence to support this.
History.
Oil pulling stems from traditional Ayurvedic medicine, whose practitioners may use sunflower oil, olive oil, or other herbal oils instead of coconut oil.
Criticism.
There is no high-quality research on oil pulling, no understanding of a possible mechanism explaining how it would work, and no evidence that it provides any benefit.
The American Dental Association agrees that there are no reliable scientific studies supporting the practice of oil pulling for any benefit to oral hygiene or overall wellbeing.
The Canadian Dental Association assessed the practice of oil pulling in 2014 stating: "We sense oil pulling won't do any harm, we're not convinced there are any particular benefits to it."
MD (Ayurveda) 
M.D.(Doctor of Medicine in Ayurveda) or Ayurveda Vachaspati is the three-year master's course in the Indian medical system of Ayurveda.
MD/MS (Ayurveda) is offered in many medical colleges in India and Sri Lanka.
The selection to the MD/MS (Ayurveda) course is generally done by a competitive National level written entrance examination which is called AIAPGET - All India AYUSH Post Graduate Entrance Test, which is open to candidates with BAMS.
The Post-Graduate Course is of 3 Years duration.
Some of the post-graduate courses are:  
Dosha 
Dosha (, IAST: "doṣa") is a central term in Ayurveda originating from Sanskrit, which can be translated as "that which can cause problems" (literally meaning "fault" or "defect"), and which refers to three categories or types of substances that are believed to be present in a person's body and mind.
Beginning with twentieth-century Ayurvedic literature, the "three-"dosha" theory" (, ) has described how the quantities and qualities of three fundamental types of substances called wind, bile, and phlegm (, , ; , , ) fluctuate in the body according to the seasons, time of day, process of digestion, and several other factors and thereby determine changing conditions of growth, aging, health, and disease.
"Dosha"s are considered to shape the physical body according to a natural constitution established at birth, determined by the constitutions of the parents as well as the time of conception and other factors.
This natural constitution represents the healthy norm for a balanced state for a particular individual.
The particular ratio of the "dosha"s in a person's natural constitution is associated with determining their mind-body type including various physiological and psychological characteristics such as physical appearance, physique, and personality.
The Ayurvedic three-"dosha" theory is often compared to European humorism although it is a distinct system with a separate history.
The three-"dosha" theory has also been compared to astrology and physiognomy in similarly deriving its tenets from ancient philosophy and superstitions.
Using them to diagnose or treat disease is considered pseudoscientific.
Role in disease, Roga.
Doshas are purely imaginary; their existence is not supported by any evidence.
The Ayurvedic notion of "dosha"s describes how bad habits, wrong diet, overwork, etc. may cause relative deficiencies or excesses which cause them to become imbalanced in relation to the natural constitution () resulting in a current condition () which may potentially lead to disease.
For example, an excess of is blamed for mental, nervous, and digestive disorders, including low energy and weakening of all body tissues.
Similarly, excess is blamed for blood toxicity, inflammation, and infection.
Excess of is blamed for increase in mucus, weight, oedema, and lung disease, etc.
The key to managing all "dosha"s is taking care of , that is taught to regulate the other two.
Principles.
The "doshas" derive their qualities from the five elements (; ) of classical Indian philosophy.
"Prana", "tejas", and "ojas".
Yoga is a set of disciplines, some that aim to balance and transform energies of the psyche.
At the roots of , and are believed to consist of its subtle counterparts called , and .
Unlike the "dosha"s, which in excess create diseases, this is believed to promote health, creativity and well-being.
Ultimately, Ayurveda seeks to reduce disease, particularly those that are chronic, and increase positive health in the body and mind via these three vital essences that aid in renewal and transformation.
Increased is associated with enthusiasm, adaptability and creativity, all of which are considered necessary when pursuing a spiritual path in yoga and to enable one to perform. is claimed to provide courage, fearlessness and insight and to be important when making decisions.
Lastly, is considered to create peace, confidence and patience to maintain consistent development and sustain continued effort.
Eventually, the most important element to develop is , believed to engender physical and psychological endurance.
Aims to achieve this include Ayurvedic diet, tonic herbs, control of the senses, a devotion and most importantly celibacy.
Criticism.
Writing in the "Skeptical Inquirer", Harriet Hall likened dosha to horoscope.
She found that different online dosha websites gave different results in personalized quizzes, and summarized that "Ayurveda is basically superstition mixed with a soupçon of practical health advice."
Alternative medicines used in Ayurveda treatments have been found to contain harmful levels of lead, mercury and other heavy metals.
Basti (Panchakarma) 
Basti is an enema of herbal oils or decoctions used in Ayurveda.
Basti is one of the five Pradhana Karmas of Panchakarma and it is used to treat vata disorders.
Sadhana Aushadhalaya 
Sadhana Aushadhalaya Ltd. is an ayurvedic pharmaceutical company in Bangladesh.
Founded in 1914 by Jogesh Chandra Ghosh, it was the first laboratory for the manufacture of ayurvedic medicine in Bangladesh.
The headquarters of the company is located on two acres of land in Gendaria under Old Dhaka.

In India, a student can go on to earn a master's degree in the form of MD (Ayurveda) and MS (Ayurveda), a PhD, and clinical doctorate degrees in traditional and complementary medicine at the university level.
There are also opportunities to perform research, work in hospital and healthcare administration, and in health supervision.
In a report from 2020, the World Health Organization stated there was "a history of combining allopathic and traditional medicine systems in India, including through medical education."
The WHO described AYUSH and conventional medical systems as "separate and parallel at the levels of governance, organisation, education and service delivery."
Permission to practice medicine.
BAMS graduates have been permitted to practice medicine in the state of Maharashtra.
In the state of Karnataka, BAMS doctors appointed in primary health centres in rural areas can practice modern-medicine in case of "emergencies".

Ayurveda 
Ayurveda () is an alternative medicine system with historical roots in the Indian subcontinent.
The theory and practice of Ayurveda is pseudoscientific.
Ayurveda is heavily practiced in India and Nepal, where around 80% of the population report using it.
Ayurveda therapies have varied and evolved over more than two millennia.
Therapies include herbal medicines, special diets, meditation, yoga, massage, laxatives, enemas, and medical oils.
Ayurvedic preparations are typically based on complex herbal compounds, minerals, and metal substances (perhaps under the influence of early Indian alchemy or "rasashastra").
Ancient Ayurveda texts also taught surgical techniques, including rhinoplasty, kidney stone extractions, sutures, and the extraction of foreign objects.
The main classical Ayurveda texts begin with accounts of the transmission of medical knowledge from the gods to sages, and then to human physicians.
Printed editions of the "Sushruta Samhita" ("Sushruta's Compendium"), frame the work as the teachings of Dhanvantari, Hindu god of Ayurveda, incarnated as King Divodāsa of Varanasi, to a group of physicians, including Sushruta.
The oldest manuscripts of the work, however, omit this frame, ascribing the work directly to King Divodāsa.
Through well-understood processes of modernization and globalization, Ayurveda has been adapted for Western consumption, notably by Baba Hari Dass in the 1970s and Maharishi Ayurveda in the 1980s.
Historical evidence for Ayurvedic texts, terminology and concepts appears from the middle of the first millennium BCE onwards.
In Ayurveda texts, "Dosha" balance is emphasized, and suppressing natural urges is considered unhealthy and claimed to lead to illness.
Ayurveda treatises describe three elemental "doshas" "viz." "vāta", "pitta" and "kapha", and state that balance (Skt. "sāmyatva") of the "doshas" results in health, while imbalance ("viṣamatva") results in disease.
Ayurveda treatises divide medicine into eight canonical components.
Ayurveda practitioners had developed various medicinal preparations and surgical procedures from at least the beginning of the common era.
There is no good evidence that Ayurveda is effective to treat or cure cancer.
Some Ayurvedic preparations have been found to contain lead, mercury, and arsenic, substances known to be harmful to humans.
A 2008 study found the three substances in close to 21% of U.S. and Indian-manufactured patent Ayurvedic medicines sold through the Internet.
The public health implications of such metallic contaminants in India are unknown.
Etymology.
The term "Āyurveda" () is composed of two words, "āyus", आयुस्, "life" or "longevity", and "veda", वेद, "knowledge", translated as "knowledge of longevity" or "knowledge of life and longevity".
Eight components.
The earliest classical Sanskrit works on Ayurveda describe medicine as being divided into eight components (Skt. "aṅga").
This characterization of the physician's art, "the medicine that has eight components" (Skt. "cikitsāyām aṣṭāṅgāyāṃ" चिकित्सायामष्टाङ्गायाम्), is first found in the Sanskrit epic the "Mahābhārata", c. 4th century BCE.
The components are: 
Principles and terminology.
The central theoretical ideas of Ayurveda show parallels with Samkhya and Vaisheshika philosophies, as well as with Buddhism and Jainism.
Balance is emphasized, and suppressing natural urges is considered unhealthy and claimed to lead to illness.
For example, to suppress sneezing is said to potentially give rise to shoulder pain.
However, people are also cautioned to stay within the limits of reasonable balance and measure when following nature's urges.
For example, emphasis is placed on moderation of food intake, sleep, and sexual intercourse.
According to Ayurveda, the human body is composed of tissues ("dhatus"), waste ("malas"), and humoral biomaterials ("doshas").
The seven "dhatus" are chyle ("rasa"), blood ("rakta"), muscles ("māmsa"), fat ("meda"), bone ("asthi"), marrow ("majja"), and semen ("shukra").
Like the medicine of classical antiquity, the classic treatises of Ayurveda divided bodily substances into five classical elements ("panchamahabhuta") "viz." earth, water, fire, air and ether.
There are also twenty gunas (qualities or characteristics) which are considered to be inherent in all matter.
These are organized in ten pairs: heavy/light, cold/hot, unctuous/dry, dull/sharp, stable/mobile, soft/hard, non-slimy/slimy, smooth/coarse, minute/gross, and viscous/liquid.
The three postulated elemental bodily humors, the "doshas" or "tridosha", are "vata" (air, which some modern authors equate with the nervous system), "pitta" (bile, fire, equated by some with enzymes), and "kapha" (phlegm, or earth and water, equated by some with mucus).
Contemporary critics assert that "doshas" are not real, but are a fictional concept.
The humours ("doshas") may also affect mental health.
Each "dosha" has particular attributes and roles within the body and mind; the natural predominance of one or more "doshas" thus explains a person's physical constitution ("prakriti") and personality.
Ayurvedic tradition holds that imbalance among the bodily and mental "doshas" is a major etiologic component of disease.
One Ayurvedic view is that the "doshas" are balanced when they are equal to each other, while another view is that each human possesses a unique combination of the "doshas" which define this person's temperament and characteristics.
In either case, it says that each person should modulate their behavior or environment to increase or decrease the "doshas" and maintain their natural state.
Practitioners of Ayurveda must determine an individual's bodily and mental "dosha" makeup, as certain "prakriti" are said to predispose one to particular diseases.
For example, a person who is thin, shy, excitable, has a pronounced Adam's apple, and enjoys of esoteric knowledge is likely "vata prakriti" and therefore more susceptible to conditions such as flatulence, stuttering, and rheumatism.
Deranged "vata" is also associated with certain mental disorders due to excited or excess "vayu" (gas), although the Ayurvedic text "Charaka Samhita" also attributes "insanity" ("unmada") to cold food and possession by the ghost of a sinful Brahman ("brahmarakshasa").
Ama (a Sanskrit word meaning "uncooked" or "undigested") is used to refer to the concept of anything that exists in a state of incomplete transformation.
With regards to oral hygiene, it is claimed to be a toxic byproduct generated by improper or incomplete digestion.
The concept has no equivalent in standard medicine.
In medieval taxonomies of the Sanskrit knowledge systems, Ayurveda is assigned a place as a subsidiary Veda (upaveda).
Some medicinal plant names from the "Atharvaveda" and other Vedas can be found in subsequent Ayurveda literature.
Some other school of thoughts considers 'Ayurveda' as the 'Fifth Veda'.
The earliest recorded theoretical statements about the canonical models of disease in Ayurveda occur in the earliest Buddhist Canon.
Practice.
Ayurvedic practitioners regard physical existence, mental existence, and personality as three separate elements of a whole person with each element being able to influence the others.
This holistic approach used during diagnosis and healing is a fundamental aspect of Ayurveda.
Another part of Ayurvedic treatment says that there are channels ("srotas") which transport fluids, and that the channels can be opened up by massage treatment using oils and Swedana (fomentation).
Unhealthy, or blocked, channels are thought to cause disease.
Diagnosis.
Ayurveda has eight ways to diagnose illness, called Nadi (pulse), Mootra (urine), Mala (stool), Jihva (tongue), Shabda (speech), Sparsha (touch), Druk (vision), and Aakruti (appearance).
Ayurvedic practitioners approach diagnosis by using the five senses.
For example, hearing is used to observe the condition of breathing and speech.
The study of the lethal points or "marman marma" is of special importance.
Treatment and prevention.
Two of the eight branches of classical Ayurveda deal with surgery ("Śalya-cikitsā" and "Śālākya-tantra"), but contemporary Ayurveda tends to stress attaining vitality by building a healthy metabolic system and maintaining good digestion and excretion.
Ayurveda also focuses on exercise, yoga, and meditation.
One type of prescription is a Sattvic diet.
Ayurveda follows the concept of Dinacharya, which says that natural cycles (waking, sleeping, working, meditation etc.) are important for health.
Hygiene, including regular bathing, cleaning of teeth, oil pulling, tongue scraping, skin care, and eye washing, is also a central practice.
Substances used.
The vast majority (90%) of Ayurvedic remedies are plant based.
Plant-based treatments in Ayurveda may be derived from roots, leaves, fruits, bark, or seeds; some examples of plant-based substances include cardamom and cinnamon.
In the 19th century, William Dymock and co-authors summarized hundreds of plant-derived medicines along with the uses, microscopic structure, chemical composition, toxicology, prevalent myths and stories, and relation to commerce in British India.
Triphala, an herbal formulation of three fruits, Amalaki, Bibhitaki, and Haritaki, is one of the most commonly used Ayurvedic remedies.
The herbs "Withania somnifera" (Ashwagandha) and "Ocimum tenuiflorum" (Tulsi) are also routinely used in Ayurveda.
Animal products used in Ayurveda include milk, bones, and gallstones.
In addition, fats are prescribed both for consumption and for external use.
Consumption of minerals, including sulphur, arsenic, lead, copper sulfate and gold, are also prescribed.
The addition of minerals to herbal medicine is called "rasashastra".
Ayurveda uses alcoholic beverages called "Madya", which are said to adjust the "doshas" by increasing "pitta" and reducing "vatta" and "kapha".
Madya are classified by the raw material and fermentation process, and the categories include: sugar-based, fruit-based, cereal-based, cereal-based with herbs, fermentated with vinegar, and tonic wines.
The intended outcomes can include causing purgation, improving digestion or taste, creating dryness, or loosening joints.
Ayurvedic texts describe Madya as non-viscid and fast-acting, and say that it enters and cleans minute pores in the body.
Purified opium is used in eight Ayurvedic preparations and is said to balance the "vata" and "kapha" "doshas" and increase the "pitta" "dosha".
It is prescribed for diarrhea and dysentery, for increasing the sexual and muscular ability, and for affecting the brain.
The sedative and pain-relieving properties of opium are considered in Ayurveda.
The use of opium is found in the ancient Ayurvedic texts, and is first mentioned in the "Sarngadhara Samhita" (1300–1400 CE), a book on pharmacy used in Rajasthan in Western India, as an ingredient of an aphrodisiac to delay male ejaculation.
It is possible that opium was brought to India along with or before Muslim conquests.
The book "Yoga Ratnakara" (1700–1800 CE, unknown author), which is popular in Maharashtra, uses opium in a herbal-mineral composition prescribed for diarrhea.
In the "Bhaisajya Ratnavali", opium and camphor are used for acute gastroenteritis.
In this drug, the respiratory depressant action of opium is counteracted by the respiratory stimulant property of camphor.
Later books have included the narcotic property for use as analgesic pain reliever.
"Cannabis indica" is also mentioned in the ancient Ayurveda books, and is first mentioned in the "Sarngadhara Samhita" as a treatment for diarrhea.
In the "Bhaisajya Ratnavali" it is named as an ingredient in an aphrodisiac.
Ayurveda says that both oil and tar can be used to stop bleeding, and that traumatic bleeding can be stopped by four different methods: ligation of the blood vessel, cauterisation by heat, use of preparations to facilitate clotting, and use of preparations to constrict the blood vessels.
Massage with oil is commonly prescribed by Ayurvedic practitioners.
Oils are used in a number of ways, including regular consumption, anointing, smearing, head massage, application to affected areas, and oil pulling.
Liquids may also be poured on the patient's forehead, a technique called shirodhara.
Panchakarma.
According to Ayurveda, panchakarma are techniques to eliminate toxic elements from the body.
Panchakarma refers to five actions, which are meant to be performed in a designated sequence with the stated aim of restoring balance in the body through a process of purgation.
Current status.
Ayurveda is widely practiced in India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Nepal where public institutions offer formal study in the form of a Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery (BAMS) degree.
In certain parts of the world, the legal standing of practitioners is equivalent to that of conventional medicine.
Several scholars have described the contemporary Indian application of Ayurvedic practice as being "biomedicalized" relative to the more "spiritualized" emphasis to practice found in variants in the West.
Exposure to European developments in medicine from the nineteenth century onwards, through European colonization of India and the subsequent institutionalized support for European forms of medicine amongst European heritage settlers in India were challenging to Ayurveda, with the entire epistemology called into question.
From the twentieth century, Ayurveda became politically, conceptually, and commercially dominated by modern biomedicine, resulting in "Modern Ayurveda" and "Global Ayurveda".
Modern Ayurveda is geographically located in the Indian subcontinent and tends towards secularization through minimization of the magic and mythic aspects of Ayurveda.
Global Ayurveda encompasses multiple forms of practice that developed through dispersal to a wide geographical area outside of India.
Smith and Wujastyk further delineate that Global Ayurveda includes those primarily interested in the Ayurveda pharmacopeia, and also the practitioners of New Age Ayurveda (which may link Ayurveda to yoga and Indian spirituality and/or emphasize preventative practice, mind body medicine, or Maharishi Ayurveda).
Since the 1980s, Ayurveda has also become the subject of interdisciplinary studies in ethnomedicine which seeks to integrate the biomedical sciences and humanities to improve the pharmacopeia of Ayurveda.
According to Industry Research, the global Ayurveda market was worth US$4.5 billion in 2017.
The Indian subcontinent.
India.
It was reported in 2008 and again in 2018 that 80 percent of people in India used Ayurveda exclusively or combined with conventional Western medicine.
A 2014 national health survey found that, in general, forms of the Indian System of Medicine or AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga and naturopathy, Unani, Sidha, and Homeopathy) were used by about 3.5% of patients who were seeking outpatient care over a two-week reference period.
In 1970, the Parliament of India passed the Indian Medical Central Council Act which aimed to standardise qualifications for Ayurveda practitioners and provide accredited institutions for its study and research.
In 1971, the Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM) was established under the Department of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha medicine and Homoeopathy (AYUSH), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, to monitor higher education in Ayurveda in India.
The Indian government supports research and teaching in Ayurveda through many channels at both the national and state levels, and helps institutionalise traditional medicine so that it can be studied in major towns and cities.
The state-sponsored Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS) is designed to do research on Ayurveda.
Many clinics in urban and rural areas are run by professionals who qualify from these institutes. , India had over 180 training centers that offered degrees in traditional Ayurvedic medicine.
To fight biopiracy and unethical patents, the government of India set up the Traditional Knowledge Digital Library in 2001 to serve as a repository for formulations from systems of Indian medicine, such as Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha medicine.
The formulations come from over 100 traditional Ayurveda books.
An Indian Academy of Sciences document quoting a 2003–04 report states that India had 432,625 registered medical practitioners, 13,925 dispensaries, 2,253 hospitals and a bed strength of 43,803. 209 undergraduate teaching institutions and 16 postgraduate institutions.
In 2012, it was reported that insurance companies covered expenses for Ayurvedic treatments in case of conditions such as spinal cord disorders, bone disorder, arthritis and cancer.
Such claims constituted 5–10 percent of the country's health insurance claims.
Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti, an organisation dedicated to fighting superstition in India, considers Ayurveda to be pseudoscience.
On 9 November 2014, India formed the Ministry of AYUSH.
National Ayurveda Day is also observed in India on the birth of Dhanvantari that is Dhanteras.
In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a report titled "The Health Workforce in India" which found that 31 percent of those who claimed to be doctors in India in 2001 were educated only up to the secondary school level and 57 percent went without any medical qualification.
The WHO study found that the situation was worse in rural India with only 18.8 percent of doctors holding a medical qualification.
Overall, the study revealed that nationally the density of all doctors (mainstream, ayurvedic, homeopathic and unani) was 8 doctors per 10,000 people compared to 13 per 10,000 people in China.
Nepal.
About 75% to 80% of the population of Nepal use Ayurveda.
As of 2009, Ayurveda was considered to be the most common and popular form of medicine in Nepal.
Sri Lanka.
The Sri Lankan tradition of Ayurveda is similar to the Indian tradition.
Practitioners of Ayurveda in Sri Lanka refer to Sanskrit texts which are common to both countries.
However, they do differ in some aspects, particularly in the herbs used.
In 1980, the Sri Lankan government established a Ministry of Indigenous Medicine to revive and regulate Ayurveda.
The Institute of Indigenous Medicine (affiliated to the University of Colombo) offers undergraduate, postgraduate, and MD degrees in Ayurveda Medicine and Surgery, and similar degrees in unani medicine.
In 2010, the public system had 62 Ayurvedic hospitals and 208 central dispensaries, which served about 3 million people (about 11% of Sri Lanka's population).
There are an estimated 20,000 registered practitioners of Ayurveda in Sri Lanka.
According to the Mahavamsa, an ancient chronicle of Sinhalese royalty from the sixth century CE, King Pandukabhaya (reigned 437 BCE to 367 BCE) had lying-in-homes and Ayurvedic hospitals (Sivikasotthi-Sala) built in various parts of the country.
This is the earliest documented evidence available of institutions dedicated specifically to the care of the sick anywhere in the world.
The hospital at Mihintale is the oldest in the world.
Outside the Indian subcontinent.
Ayurveda is a system of traditional medicine developed during antiquity and the medieval period, and as such is comparable to pre-modern Chinese and European systems of medicine.
In the 1960s, Ayurveda began to be advertised as alternative medicine in the Western world.
Due to different laws and medical regulations around the globe, the expanding practice and commercialisation of Ayurveda raised ethical and legal issues.
Through well-understood processes of modernization and globalization, Ayurveda was adapted for Western consumption, notably by Baba Hari Dass in the 1970s and by Maharishi Ayurveda in the 1980s.
In some cases, this involved active fraud on the part of proponents of Ayurveda in an attempt to falsely represent the system as equal to the standards of modern medical research.
United States.
Baba Hari Dass was an early proponent who helped bring Ayurveda to the United States in the early 1970s.
His teachings led to the establishment of the Mount Madonna Institute.
He invited several notable Ayurvedic teachers, including Vasant Lad, Sarita Shrestha, and Ram Harsh Singh.
The Ayurvedic practitioner Michael Tierra wrote that the "history of Ayurveda in North America will always owe a debt to the selfless contributions of Baba Hari Dass."
In the United States, the practice of Ayurveda is not licensed or regulated by any state.
The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) stated that "Few well-designed clinical trials and systematic research reviews suggest that Ayurvedic approaches are effective".
The NCCIH warned against the issue of heavy metal poisoning, and emphasised the use of conventional health providers first.
As of 2018, the NCCIH reported that 240,000 Americans were using Ayurvedic medicine.
Europe.
The first Ayurvedic clinic in Switzerland was opened in 1987 by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.
In 2015, the government of Switzerland introduced a federally recognized diploma in Ayurveda.
Classification and efficacy.
Ayurvedic medicine is considered pseudoscientific because its premises are not based on science.
Both the lack of scientific soundness in the theoretical foundations of Ayurveda and the quality of research have been criticized.
Although laboratory experiments suggest that some herbs and substances in Ayurveda might be developed into effective treatments, there is no evidence that any are effective in themselves.
There is no good evidence that Ayurvedic medicine is effective to treat or cure cancer in people.
Although Ayurveda may help "improve quality of life" and Cancer Research UK also acknowledges that "researchers have found that some Ayurvedic treatments can help relieve cancer symptoms," the organization warns that some Ayurvedic drugs contain toxic substances or may interact with legitimate cancer drugs in a harmful way.
Ethnologist Johannes Quack writes that although the rationalist movement Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti officially labels Ayurveda a pseudoscience akin to astrology, these practices are in fact embraced by many of the movement's members.
A review of the use of Ayurveda for cardiovascular disease concluded that the evidence is not convincing for the use of any Ayurvedic herbal treatment for heart disease or hypertension, but that many herbs used by Ayurvedic practitioners could be appropriate for further research.
Research.
In India, research in Ayurveda is undertaken by the Ministry of AYUSH through a national network of research institutes.
In Nepal, the National Ayurvedic Training and Research Centre (NATRC) researches medicinal herbs in the country.
In Sri Lanka, the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine looks after the research in Ayurveda through various national research institutes.
Use of toxic metals.
"Rasashastra", the practice of adding metals, minerals or gems to herbal preparations, may include toxic heavy metals such as lead, mercury and arsenic.
The public health implications of metals in "rasashastra" in India is unknown.
Adverse reactions to herbs are described in traditional Ayurvedic texts, but practitioners are reluctant to admit that herbs could be toxic and that reliable information on herbal toxicity is not readily available.
There is a communication gap between practitioners of medicine and Ayurveda.
Some traditional Indian herbal medicinal products contain harmful levels of heavy metals, including lead.
For example, ghasard, a product commonly given to infants for digestive issues, has been found to have up to 1.6% lead concentration by weight, leading to lead encephalopathy.
A 1990 study on Ayurvedic medicines in India found that 41% of the products tested contained arsenic, and that 64% contained lead and mercury.
A 2004 study found toxic levels of heavy metals in 20% of Ayurvedic preparations made in South Asia and sold in the Boston area, and concluded that Ayurvedic products posed serious health risks and should be tested for heavy-metal contamination.
A 2008 study of more than 230 products found that approximately 20% of remedies (and 40% of "rasashastra" medicines) purchased over the Internet from U.S. and Indian suppliers contained lead, mercury or arsenic.
A 2015 study of users in the United States found elevated blood lead levels in 40% of those tested, leading physician and former U.S. Air Force flight surgeon Harriet Hall to say that "Ayurveda is basically superstition mixed with a soupçon of practical health advice.
And it can be dangerous."
Heavy metals are thought of as active ingredients by advocates of Indian herbal medicinal products.
According to ancient Ayurvedic texts, certain physico-chemical purification processes such as "samskaras" or "shodhanas" (for metals) 'detoxify' the heavy metals in it.
These are similar to the Chinese "pao zhi", although the Ayurvedic techniques are more complex and may involve physical pharmacy techniques as well as mantras.
However, these products have nonetheless caused severe lead poisoning and other toxic effects.
Between 1978 and 2008, "more than 80 cases of lead poisoning associated with Ayurvedic medicine use [were] reported worldwide".
In 2012, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) linked Ayurvedic drugs to lead poisoning, based on cases where toxic materials were found in the blood of pregnant women who had taken Ayurvedic drugs.
Ayurvedic practitioners argue that the toxicity of bhasmas (ash products) comes from improper manufacturing processes, contaminants, improper use of Ayurvedic medicine, quality of raw materials and that the end products and improper procedures are used by charlatans.
In India, the government ruled that Ayurvedic products must be labelled with their metallic content.
However, in "Current Science", a publication of the Indian Academy of Sciences, M. S. Valiathan said that "the absence of post-market surveillance and the paucity of test laboratory facilities [in India] make the quality control of Ayurvedic medicines exceedingly difficult at this time".
In the United States, most Ayurvedic products are marketed without having been reviewed or approved by the FDA.
Since 2007, the FDA has placed an import alert on some Ayurvedic products in order to prevent them from entering the United States.
A 2012 toxicological review of mercury-based traditional herbo-metallic preparations concluded that the long-term pharmacotherapeutic and in-depth toxicity studies of these preparations are lacking.
History.
Some scholars assert that the concepts of traditional Ayurvedic medicine have existed since the times of the Indus Valley civilisation but since the Indus script has not been deciphered, such assertions are moot.
The Atharvaveda contains hymns and prayers aimed at curing disease.
There are various legendary accounts of the origin of Ayurveda, such as that it was received by Dhanvantari (or Divodasa) from Brahma.
Tradition also holds that the writings of Ayurveda were influenced by a lost text by the sage Agnivesha.
Ayurveda is one of the few systems of medicine developed in ancient times that is still widely practiced in modern times.
As such, it is open to the criticism that its conceptual basis is obsolete and that its contemporary practitioners have not taken account of the developments in medicine.
Responses to this situation led to an impassioned debate in India during the early decades of the twentieth century, between proponents of unchanging tradition ("śuddha" "pure" Ayurveda) and those who thought Ayurveda should modernize and syncretize ("aśuddha" "impure, tainted" Ayurveda).
The political debate about the place of Ayurveda in contemporary India has continued to the present, both in the public arena and in government.
Debate about the place of Ayurvedic medicine in the contemporary internationalized world also continues today.
Main texts.
Many ancient works on Ayurvedic medicine are lost to posterity, but manuscripts of three principal early texts on Ayurveda have survived to the present day.
These works are the Charaka Samhita, the Sushruta Samhita and the Bhela Samhita.
The dating of these works is historically complicated since they each internally present themselves as composite works compiled by several editors.
All past scholarship on their dating has been evaluated by Meulenbeld in volumes IA and IB of his "History of Indian Medical Literature".
After considering the evidence and arguments concerning the "Suśrutasaṃhitā", Meulenbeld stated (IA, 348), The "Suśrutasaṃhitā" is most probably the work of an unknown author who drew much of the material he incorporated in his treatise from a multiplicity of earlier sources from various periods.
This may explain that many scholars yield to the temptation to recognize a number of distinct layers and, consequently, try to identify elements belonging to them.
As we have seen, the identification of features thought to belong to a particular stratum is in many cases determined by preconceived ideas on the age of the strata and their supposed authors.
The dating of this work to 600 BCE was first proposed by Hoernle over a century ago, but has long since been overturned by subsequent historical research.
The current consensus amongst medical historians of South Asia is that the "Suśrutasaṃhitā" was compiled over a period of time starting with a kernel of medical ideas from the century or two BCE and then being revised by several hands into its present form by about 500 CE.
The view that the text was updated by the Buddhist scholar Nagarjuna in the 2nd century CE has been disproved, although the last chapter of the work, the Uttaratantra, was added by an unknown later author before 500 CE.
Similar arguments apply to the Charaka Samhita, written by Charaka, and the Bhela Samhita, attributed to Atreya Punarvasu, that are also dated to the 6th century BCE by non-specialist scholars but are in fact, in their present form, datable to a period between the second and fifth centuries CE.
The Charaka Samhita was also updated by Dridhabala during the early centuries of the Common Era.
The Bower Manuscript (dated to the early 6th century CE) includes of excerpts from the "Bheda Samhita" and its description of concepts in Central Asian Buddhism.
In 1987, A. F. R. Hoernle identified the scribe of the medical portions of the manuscript to be a native of India using a northern variant of the Gupta script, who had migrated and become a Buddhist monk in a monastery in Kucha.
The Chinese pilgrim Fa Hsien (c. 337–422 CE) wrote about the healthcare system of the Gupta empire (320–550) and described the institutional approach of Indian medicine.
This is also visible in the works of Charaka, who describes hospitals and how they should be equipped.
Some dictionaries of materia medica include "Astanga nighantu" (8th century) by Vagbhata, "Paryaya ratnamala" (9th century) by Madhava, "Siddhasara nighantu" (9th century) by Ravi Gupta, "Dravyavali "(10th century), and "Dravyaguna sangraha" (11th century) by Chakrapani Datta, among others.
Illnesses portrayed.
Underwood and Rhodes state that the early forms of traditional Indian medicine identified fever, cough, consumption, diarrhea, dropsy, abscesses, seizures, tumours, and leprosy, and that treatments included plastic surgery, lithotomy, tonsillectomy, couching (a form of cataract surgery), puncturing to release fluids in the abdomen, extraction of foreign bodies, treatment of anal fistulas, treating fractures, amputations, cesarean sections, and stitching of wounds.
The use of herbs and surgical instruments became widespread.
During this period, treatments were also prescribed for complex ailments, including angina pectoris, diabetes, hypertension, and stones.
Further development and spread.
Ayurveda flourished throughout the Indian Middle Ages.
Dalhana (fl. 1200), Sarngadhara (fl. 1300) and Bhavamisra (fl. 1500) compiled works on Indian medicine.
The medical works of both Sushruta and Charaka were also translated into the Chinese language in the 5th century, and during the 8th century, they were translated into the Arabic and Persian language.
The 9th-century Persian physician Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi was familiar with the text.
The Arabic works derived from the Ayurvedic texts eventually also reached Europe by the 12th century.
In Renaissance Italy, the Branca family of Sicily and Gaspare Tagliacozzi (Bologna) were influenced by the Arabic reception of the Sushruta's surgical techniques.
British physicians traveled to India to observe rhinoplasty being performed using Indian methods, and reports on their rhinoplasty methods were published in the "Gentleman's Magazine" in 1794.
Instruments described in the "Sushruta Samhita" were further modified in Europe.
Joseph Constantine Carpue studied plastic surgery methods in India for 20 years and, in 1815, was able to perform the first major rhinoplasty surgery in the western world, using the "Indian" method of nose reconstruction.&lt;ref name="Lock651/2"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1840 Brett published an article about this technique.
The British had shown some interest in understanding local medicinal practices in the early nineteenth century.
A Native Medical Institution was setup in 1822 where both indigenous and European medicine were taught.
After the English Education Act 1835, their policy changed to champion European medicine and disparage local practices.
After Indian independence, there was more focus on Ayurveda and other traditional medical systems.
Ayurveda became a part of the Indian National healthcare system, with state hospitals for Ayurveda established across the country.
However, the treatments of traditional medicines were not always integrated with others.
Dhanvantari 
Dhanvantari () is the physician of the devas in Hinduism.
He is regarded to be an avatar of Vishnu.
He is mentioned in the Puranas as the god of Ayurveda.
During his incarnation on earth, he reigned as the King of Kashi, today locally referred to as Varanasi.
Dhanvantari is also identified as the great-grandfather of Divodasa, a mythological King of Kashi in the Vishnu Purana.
Iconography.
According to the ancient Sanskrit work "Vishnudharamottara", Dhanvantari is a handsome individual and is to usually be depicted with four hands, with one or two of them carrying a bowl of amrita, the elixir of immortality.
Dhanvantari is depicted in a stark resemblance to Vishnu, with four hands, holding the shankha, chakra, jalauka (leech), and a pot containing amrita.
He is often shown with a leech in his hand rather than the scriptures, indicating the historical practice of bloodletting.
Some texts describe him as holding a conch, amrita, medicinal herbs, and a book of Ayurveda.
Legend.
Origin.
"The Bala Kanda" of the "Ramayana" and "Bhagavata Purana" state that Dhanvantari emerged from the Ocean of Milk and appeared with the pot of amrita (elixir of immortality) during the "Samudra Mathana," whilst the ocean was being churned by the devas and the asuras, using the Mandara mountain and the serpent Vasuki.
The pot of amrita was snatched by the asuras, and after this event, Vishnu's avatar, Mohini, appears and takes the nectar back from the asuras.
It is also believed that Dhanvantari promulgated the practice of Ayurveda.
Of special mention here is the treatise of "Dhanvantari-Nighantu", which completely elucidates Dhanvantari's medicinal plants.
The Brahmanda Purana describes the origin of the physician deity: 
Incarnation.
During the second Dvapara Yuga, the King of Kashi, Dirghatapas, propitiated the physician deity for the birth of a son.
The deity agreed to incarnate himself as the desired child as a boon.
Dhanavantri proved to be a great king, and is described as the "dispeller of all ailments".
He is described to have been exempt from infirmities and recognised as a "master of universal knowledge".
The sage Bharadvaja educated him regarding the therapeutic practice of Ayurveda, and further caused him to study medicine.
The king created a classification of his knowledge of medicine into eight fields and disseminated it to a number of diverse disciples.
Dhanvantari and Manasa.
According to the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Dhanvantari, accompanied by his disciples, once journeyed to Kailasha.
On the way, a naga named Takshaka emitted a venom-spitting hiss.
A disciple plucked the diamond upon the head of Takshaka and hurled it towards the earth.
Upon learning these events, the powerful serpent-king Vasuki amassed thousands of serpents under the leadership of Drona, Pundarika, and Dhananjaya against the entourage.
The poisonous emissions of all these serpents united to make the disciples of Dhanvantari faint.
Immediately, Dhanvantari concocted a medicine made from "vanaspati", allowing his followers to recover and causing the snakes to faint in turn.
When Vasuki understood what had transpired, he sent a Shaiva serpent goddess, Manasa, to face Dhanvantari.
Manasa sent the disciples of Dhanvantari into a swoon, but since the deity was proficient in the art of "Vishvavidya", he soon restored his disciples to consciousness.
When Manasa deemed it impossible to defeat Dhanvantari or his disciples, she held the trishula given to her by Shiva and aimed it at Dhanvantari.
Seeing this, Shiva and Brahma appeared before them and restored the peace, sending them all on their way.
Temples.
India.
In Maharashtra.
In Konkan, There is a Dhanvantari temple at Dapoli, District Ratnagiri, Maharashtra.
It belongs to Dongare family and is owned and run by Vaidya Aniruddha Dongare.
Many devotees from Konkan and rest of Maharashtra visit the temple and offer their prayers.
Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Puducherry.
There are a few dedicated temples to Dhanvantari in South India especially in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where ayurveda is highly practised and patronised.
The Thottuva Dhanwanthari temple in Kerala is a particularly famous temple, where Lord Dhanvantari's idol is almost six feet tall and facing east.
On the right hand the lord holds amrita and with the left hand the lord holds Atta, Shanku and Chakra.
The 'Ekadasi' day celebration, which falls on the same day as the 'Guruvayur Ekadasi' is of special significance.
In Tamil Nadu, in the courtyard of Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple (Srirangam), there is a Dhanvantari shrine where daily worship of the deity is performed.
In front of this temple there is an engraved stone believed to be from the 12th century.
According to the writings on the stone, Garuda Vahana Bhattar, a great ayurvedic physician, established the statue inside the temple.
A "prasada" or "tirtham", a herbal decoction, is given to the visitors.
The shrine is the oldest Dhanvantari shrine in the state.
Another Dhanvantari shrine is found in the second precinct of Varadaraja Perumal Temple in Kanchipuram.
Dhanvanthari temples in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry include: 
Others.
In Varanaseya Sanskrit Vishwavidyalaya, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh state, one statue of Dhanvantari is present in the university museum.
Two statues are at the headquarters of the Central Council for Research in Ayurveda and Siddha at New Delhi.

Commemoration.
Devotees pray to Dhanvantari to seek his blessings for sound health for themselves and others on Dhanteras, two days before Deepavali.
It is also celebrated as National Ayurveda Day in India, which was first observed in 2016.
Clinical trials on Ayurveda 
Clinical trials on Ayurveda refers to any clinical trials done on Ayurvedic treatment.
Ayurveda is a traditional medicine system in India and like other cultural medical practices includes both conventional medicine and also complementary and alternative medicine.
When there are clinical trials in Ayurveda, the focus tends to be on practices in alternative medicine.
A 2017 essay described that in India, Ayurveda is inadequately equipped to manage many modern diseases, owing to insufficient research and development.
The essay argued that clinical trials in Ayurveda should focus on areas outside the scope of modern medicine.
Also, while there is a short history of clinical research on Ayurvedic treatments, there is no existing systematic review available which identifies all the studies and interprets them as a whole.
Educational organizations which teach Ayurveda require training if they are to design clinical trials on Ayurvedic treatments.
As of 2016 the Clinical Trials Registry - India contained approximately 200 records of clinical trials on Ayurvedic treatments.
List of clinical trials.
Of all the recorded clinical trials, the following treatments are those for which there are meta-analyses of multiple trials: 
Bhaskar Vishwananth Ghokale 
Bhaskar Vishwanath Gokhale (19 April 1903 – 12 January 1962), also known as Vaidya Bhaskar Vishwanath Gokhale, and popularly called Mama Gokhaleji, was an Indian Ayurveda practitioner, Ayurvedic teacher, freedom fighter, and philosopher.
Life.
Bhaskar Vishwananth Gokhale was born on 19 April 1903 in Kolhapur (Maharashtra).
His father, Vishwanath Gokhale, was a judge, and Bhaskar was the youngest of his children.
His mother, Parvati Gokhale, died at an early age.
After he finished school in Kolhapur, Gokhale moved to Mumbai for further studies.
He enrolled in the National Medical College, which supported the non-cooperation movement against the British Raj.
When the college withdrew its support for the Indian independence movement, he left to support of the movement and was imprisoned three times (1924, 1928, and 1932).
In 1924, Gokhale joined Tilak Ayurveda Mahavidyalaya in Pune.
In 1928, he became "Ayurveda Visharada", completed his postgraduate work and later was the first to earn the degree of "Ayurveda Parangata" in 1937.
In 1942, he participated in the Quit India Movement and was imprisoned for two years.
After the death of Vaidya Purushottam Shastri Nanal, Gokhale worked as the chief physician of Tarachand Ramnath Hospital in Pune.
In 1946, he became the principal of Tilak Ayurveda Vidyalaya, and wrote three books, two of which ("Dosha Dhatu Mala Vidnyana" and "Vikruti Vidnyana") give insights into Ayurveda.
His other book, "Chikitsapradeep," is a reference book for Ayurvedic students.
He was also the head of Tilak Ayurveda Mahavidyalaya and Seth Tarachand Ramnath Hospital for over 20 years.
In 1956, Gokhale became the first principal of the postgraduate institute at Jamnagar.
In 1960, the Maharashtra government inducted him as President of the State Board and Chairman of the State Faculty of Ayurvedic and Unani Medicine.
Rasashastra 
In Ayurvedic medicine, the compilation of traditional ancient Indian medicine practice is called rasaśāstra (रसशासत्र ), which details processes by which various metals, minerals and other substances, including mercury, are purified and combined with herbs in an attempt to treat illnesses.
Rasashastra is a pharmaceutical branch of Indian system of medicine which mainly deals with the metals, minerals, animal origin product, toxic herbs and their use in therapeutics.
History of development.
The credit of developing "rasashastra" as a stream of classical Ayurveda, especially in fulfilling its healthcare-related goals, goes to Nāgārjuna (5th century CE).
Classical textbooks.
"Rasendra Mangala".
It was composed by Nāgārjuna Siddha in the Sanskrit language.
P.
C.
Rây considered this work (which he erroneously called "Rasaratnākara") to be amongst the earliest surviving alchemical works, perhaps from as early as the 7th or 8th century.
The text actually dates to the 12th century.
Rasendramangala originally comprised eight chapters, only four of which are found in the manuscripts available today.
Manuscripts of the work are found at Gujarat Ayurveda University, Jamnagar, at Rajasthan Prachya Vidya Pratishthan, Govt. office Bikaner and elsewhere.
An edition and translation was published in 2003.
"Rasa Hridaya Tantra".
It was created by Shrimad Govind Bhagvatapad, guru of Shankaracharya, around in the 10th century.
It contains elaborate description of "dhatuvada" ( metallurgical processes to transform mercury into higher metals as gold or silver).
A Sanskrit commentary on this text was contributed by Shri Chaturbhuj Mishra under the name of "Mugdhavabodhini."
"Rasarnava".
Edited and published in 1908–1910.
Written by Bhairava.
"Rasa Prakasha Sudhakara".
It is a 13th-century text by Acharya Yashodhar Bhatt.
It was first published by Acharya Yadavji Trikam in 1910.
Its second edition was published in 1912 under guidance of Shri Jivaram Kalidas Vyas.
It contains 13 chapters describing both Lauhavad (use of metallurgical processes to convert lower metals to higher metals), and Chikitsavad ( use of metals and minerals for therapeutic use).
It also describes the origin of mercury, its properties, 18 samskaras (processing techniques) of mercury as well as the tools and techniques involved in them.
"Rasendra Chudamani".
It was created by Aacharya Somadeva approximately in 12th–13th century.
It contains 13 chapters which give elaborate description of mercury and its processing for medicinal use; definition and description of equipments and "Puta" (temperature requirements and regulation during processing).
It can be inferred that at the time of its creation the Gurukula system of education was prevalent as it contains description about "Shishyopnayana samskara" ( ritual performed at the time of admission ).
Specific contribution of this text include high degree of organization followed during compilation and description of 64 "divya-aushadis" (drugs with miraculous effect) for the very first time.
" Rasa Ratna Samuccaya".
It was created by Vāgbhaṭa, son of Vaidyapati Siṃhagupta, around the end of the 13th century or beginning of the 14th century.
It contains around 30 chapters.
It is considered one of the best treatises written in the field of "rasashastra".
It contains vivid description of Yantras (tools, equipments), Puta (temperature related processing details), classification of metals and minerals into Rasa, Uprasa, Lauha, Dhatu, Updhatu etc. as well as their processing details.
It also describes clinical aspects of Rasa aushadhis.
However, it is not considered as an original text.
Rather it is considered as a compilation of works of other Acharyas.
Though it may contain some original work of Vagbhatta, but it is difficult to differentiate.
It derives much of its contributions from Rasendrachudamani of Somadeva.
Rasaprabha and Vijnanbodhini are two of the Hindi commentaries available.
Saralarthprakashini is one of the Sanskrit commentary available by Sriyut Shastri Khare.
Methods.
The methods of "rasashastra" are contained in a number of Ayurvedic texts, including the "Charaka Samhita" and "Susruta Samhita".
An important feature is the use of metals, including several that are considered to be toxic in evidence-based medicine.
In addition to mercury, gold, silver, iron, copper, tin, lead, zinc and bell metal are used.
In addition to these metals, salts and other substances such as coral, seashells, and feathers are also used.
The usual means used to administer these substances is by preparations called "bhasma", Sanskrit for "ash".
Calcination, which is described in the literature of the art as "shodhana", "purification", is the process used to prepare these "bhasma" for administration.
Sublimation and the preparation of a mercury sulfide are also in use in the preparation of its "materia medica".
A variety of methods are used to achieve this.
One involves the heating of thin sheets of metal and then immersing them in oil ("taila"), extract ("takra"), cow urine ("gomutra") and other substances.
Others are calcined in crucibles heated with fires of cow dung ("puttam").
Ayurvedic practitioners believe that this process of purification removes undesirable qualities and enhances their therapeutic power.
Toxicity.
Modern medicine finds that mercury is inherently toxic, and that its toxicity is not due to the presence of impurities.
While mercury does have anti-microbial properties, and used to be widely used in Western medicine, its toxicity does not warrant the risk of using it as a health product in most circumstances.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have also reported a number of cases of lead poisoning associated with Ayurvedic medicine.
Other incidents of heavy metal poisoning have been attributed to the use of "rasashastra" compounds in the United States, and arsenic has also been found in some of the preparations, which have been marketed in the United States under trade names such as "AyurRelief", "GlucoRite", "Acnenil", "Energize", "Cold Aid", and "Lean Plus".
Ayurvedic practitioners claim that these reports of toxicity are due to failure to follow traditional practices in the mass production of these preparations for sale, but modern science finds that not only mercury, but also lead is inherently toxic.
The government of India has ordered that Ayurvedic products must specify their metallic content directly on the labels of the product; however, M. S. Valiathan noted that "the absence of post-market surveillance and the paucity of test laboratory facilities [in India] make the quality control of Ayurvedic medicines exceedingly difficult at this time.
Lehyam 
Lehyam (), also referred to as Lekiyam () refers to a traditional Indian electuary or confection.
Classification.
Classified as a product of Siddha medicine, lehyam is regarded to be a healthy body tonic, consumed to resolve digestive and respiratory problems, comprising ingredients that are easily absorbed by the body.
Ingredients and preparation.
Lehyam is prepared using powdered medicine, jaggery, sugar, honey, in an aqueous medium of water.
Ghee is often added as a preserving agent, and after preparation, the food may be rolled into small balls and left to harden within a vessel, edible for up to a year.
Variations and uses.
Various forms of lehyam exist, and are named for their ingredients, and offer different properties.
For instance, in Tamil Nadu, "inji lekiyam", for which the salient ingredient is ginger, is offered to a new mother shortly after her delivery.
"Thaneervittan" (asparagus) "legiyam" and "sowbhagiyasundi" (dry ginger powder) "legiyam" are used similarly.
"Nellikai lekiyam", for which the salient ingredient is gooseberry, is offered to children to boost their immunity.
In South India, lehyam is often prepared and purchased on the occasion of Deepavali to aid the digestion, and counteract the effects, of eating sweets during the festival.
According to "The Hindu", Deepavali legiyam, or Deepavali marundhu, is popular in Chennai, and made in many households at festival time.
"Ciṭṭukkuruvi lēkiyam", prepared from sparrow meat, was once consumed for aphrodisiacal purposes.
A History of Hindu Chemistry 
"A History of Hindu Chemistry" is a two-volume book authored by Prafulla Chandra Ray, who was Professor of Chemistry at Presidency College, Kolkata, and published in the first decade of the twentieth century.
Volume 1 was published in 1902 and Volume 2 in 1909.
Both volumes were published by Williams and Norgate, London.
The full title of the book runs as follows: "A History of Hindu Chemistry from the Earliest Times to the Middle of the Sixteenth Century AD with Sanskrit Texts, Variants, Translation and Illustrations".
Both volumes are available for free download from Internet Archive.
In contemporaneous review of Volume 1 of the book that appeared in the Nature magazine, the reviewer has summed up his review thus: "Dr Ray has ably carried out his task of proving that the ancient lore of the Hindus are far in advance of the rest of the world, China excepted."
Contents.
Volume 1 begins with a 79-page introduction divided into six chapters which respectively deal with the alchemical ideas in the Vedas, the Ayurvedic period, the transitional period, the tantric period, the iatrochemical period and the indebtedness of the Arabians to India.
The Hindu chemistry of these periods are further elaborated in Volume 1 and also in Volume 2.
Both volumes contain extracts and translation of Sanskrit texts dealing with chemistry.
Ayurveda Day 
Ayurveda Day, also known as National Ayurveda Day, is observed every year in India and worldwide on the occasion of the birthday of Dhanvantari, the Hindu god of medicine.
The "Puranas" mentioned him as the god of Ayurveda.
In 2016, the Government of India's Ministry of AYUSH declared the birth anniversary of Dhanvantari as National Ayurveda Day.
The first Ayurveda Day was first celebrated on 28 October 2016.
History.
National Ayurveda Day was first observed in India on the 28th October 2016 to mark the day of Dhanwantri Jayanti (Dhanteras).
It is observed to promote and globalise Ayurveda as one of the most ancient and holistic approaches to medicine globally.
Various education institutes, colleges and hospitals organise free health camps and provide free medicines to celebrate Ayurveda Day.
In October 2016, on Ayurveda Day, the first All India Institute of Ayurveda was inaugurated by PM Narendra Modi in New Delhi.
The government also honours people who contributed to Ayurvedic treatment and research on Ayurveda Day with 'National Dhanwantari Ayurveda Award' every year.
The National Dhanwantari Ayurveda Awards consist of a citation, trophy (Statue of Dhanwantari) and cash prize of 5 Lakh.
In 2022, the All India Institute of Ayurveda, Delhi launched the 'Har Din Har Ghar Ayurveda Quiz' on the MyGov platform to create awareness about Ayurveda.
In 2022, it was celebrated on 23 October.
In 2021, the day was celebrated with a theme titled 'Ayurveda for Poshan (Nutrition) on November 2, 2021, to promote the Ayurvedic principles of wellness and healing.
Qurayshi al-Shirazi 
Nur al-Din Muhammad Abd-Allah ibn Hakim ‘Ayn al-Mulk Qurayshi Shirazi was a mid 17th century Persian physician in Mughal India.
As indicated by his nisba, he was from Shiraz, Iran.
He is best known for his large synopsis of "Yunani" or Unani medicine (Greco-Roman medicine as inherited by Islam) and Hindu medicine (Ayurveda) that was entitled "Zakhira-i Dara-Shukuhi" and dedicated to the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan's son Dara Shikuh, who ruled as emperor from 1657-9CE.
He also composed in 1628 CE a Persian pharmacological dictionary titled "Alfaz al-adwiyah" which he had dedicated to Shah Jahan himself, of which the National Library of Medicine has a copy.
